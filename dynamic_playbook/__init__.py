"""Dynamic playbook facade for governance utilities.

This module intentionally exposes the high level playbook primitives that are
implemented inside :mod:`dynamic.governance.ags`.  Several downstream
workflows – including the NFY playbook regression tests – import these objects
directly from :mod:`dynamic_playbook`.  A recent refactor limited the exports
to only the AGS helpers which caused ``ImportError`` exceptions in those
consumers.  Restoring the broader facade keeps the public API stable while the
implementation details remain nested inside ``dynamic.governance``.
