"""Conceptual models for representing hierarchical systems.

The module distils common language around hierarchies into structured data
objects that other parts of the codebase can import.  The goal is to offer a
clear, declarative description of how hierarchies function, what
characteristics they exhibit, and how different organisational models
interpret the hierarchy concept.

The data is intentionally lightweight â€“ a hierarchy is represented as a set of
`dataclasses` and frozen collections so it can be serialised, documented, or
rendered in APIs without additional transformation logic.
