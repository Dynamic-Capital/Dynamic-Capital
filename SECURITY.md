## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report security issues privately through this repository's GitHub Security
Advisories (Security → Report a vulnerability). Maintainers monitor this
channel and will acknowledge reports within **72 hours**.

After verification, we aim to ship a fix within **14 days** and will keep you
informed of progress. Once resolved, we coordinate disclosure and credit the
reporter if desired.
