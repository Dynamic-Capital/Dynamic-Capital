# Governance Services

The governance pillar coordinates stakeholder alignment and automated policy
execution.

- **AGS** (`dynamic/governance/ags/`): Home for the Autonomous Governance Suite
  (policy playbooks, DAG orchestrators, and sync utilities).

Future governance modules should document their automation workflows and expose
stable entry points in their respective `__init__.py` files.
