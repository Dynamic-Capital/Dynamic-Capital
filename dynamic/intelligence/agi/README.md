# Intelligence Â· Dynamic AGI

`dynamic/intelligence/agi/` powers the self-improving intelligence loop. It
combines model training automation, local evaluation workflows, and deployment
helpers for AGI services.

Contents overview:

- `model.py`: Core AGI orchestrator with identity metadata and signal blending.
- `build.py`: CLI utilities for producing governance-friendly AGI payloads.
- `self_improvement.py`: Continuous improvement loop coordinating diagnostics
  and retraining.
- Auxiliary helpers for fine-tuning, local experimentation, and rollout.

Document new AGI routines here so downstream operations understand required
inputs and expected outputs.
