# Intelligence Services

The intelligence pillar bundles Dynamic Capital's AGI and AI-assisted tooling.
It is organised into two core modules:

- **AGI** (`dynamic/intelligence/agi/`): Self-improving intelligence loops,
  governance retraining, and deployment automation for autonomous agents.
- **AI Apps** (`dynamic/intelligence/ai_apps/`): Research assistants, fusion
  engines, hedging policies, and persona orchestration used by traders.

New intelligence features should clearly document model lifecycles, data
requirements, and integration points within their subdirectories.
