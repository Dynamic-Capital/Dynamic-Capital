# Brand System

`dynamic/brand/` centralises shared design tokens, copy, and experience assets.
Use this space to coordinate marketing collateral, UI themes, and storytelling
artifacts so each module presents a unified Dynamic Capital identity.

Future additions should document how assets are consumed (web, docs, campaigns)
and note any dependencies on external design systems.
