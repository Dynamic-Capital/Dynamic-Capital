# Dynamic Capital â€” Telegram Mini App (React + Tailwind)

- Landing page (`/`): greet user and direct to dashboard.
- Dashboard (`/dashboard`): show VIP status and list active education packages.
- Uses Telegram WebApp SDK; derives Supabase Functions URLs from the same project as the bot (`functionUrl()`).
- Calls `verify-initdata` and `miniapp-health` on Supabase Edge; reads packages via Supabase REST (anon key only).
- Responsive, modern Tailwind design with dark mode.
