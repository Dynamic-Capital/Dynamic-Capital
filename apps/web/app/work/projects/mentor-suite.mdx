## What we built

A workspace where mentors run four-week sprints with members, combining goal tracking, journaling, and accountability touchpoints.

## Key features

- **Sprint templates** – Mentors can duplicate proven sprint structures, customise metrics, and assign automation experiments.
- **Review studio** – Side-by-side video playback of trades with annotation tools, so members relive decisions and record improvements.
- **Outcome scoring** – Automatic scoring of sprint success based on the metric chosen at kickoff, with alerts if the trend reverses.

## Results

- Members who completed two sprints improved average R by 18% and cut drawdown recovery time by 31%.
- Mentors now manage twice as many traders thanks to automation of scheduling, reminders, and Loom processing.
