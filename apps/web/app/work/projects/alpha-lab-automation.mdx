## Challenge

Manual execution could not keep up with the volume of signals analysts produced. We needed automation that respected human intent, complied with risk limits, and remained observable.

## Solution

- Built event-driven workers that subscribe to asset-specific Redis streams.
- Added a central risk registry with per-member drawdown governors and auto-pause logic.
- Exposed mentor overrides so discretionary adjustments could be layered without redeploying code.

```ts
export function shouldPause(memberId: string) {
  const state = riskRegistry.get(memberId);
  if (!state) return false;
  return state.realizedDrawdown >= state.maxDrawdown || state.flags.includes("mentor_pause");
}
```

## Impact

- Average time from signal publish to execution fell from 12 minutes to under 2 seconds.
- Automation now manages $42M AUM across 17 exchanges with consistent reporting and audit trails.
- Mentors gained a live console showing order status, overrides, and performance per strategy.
