## Brief

Members needed a succinct read on the global tape that went beyond price recap. We designed an outlook engine that fuses liquidity, policy, and positioning signals into a ranked playbook that drives daily execution.

## Inputs & Signal Conditioning

- **Macro telemetry** – Treasury balance sheet, open interest, and policy path deltas stream through the Dynamic Intelligence API every 15 minutes.
- **Order flow footprints** – Exchange-level participation, resting liquidity imbalances, and dark pool prints arrive via the Liquidity Signal Desk.
- **Sentiment & volatility** – Curated news embeddings, vol surface skews, and Telegram poll drift are normalized into a 0-100 conviction scale.

```ts
export function scoreOutlook(signal: NormalizedSignal): number {
  const weights = {
    macro: 0.4,
    flow: 0.35,
    sentiment: 0.25,
  } satisfies Record<keyof NormalizedSignal, number>;

  return (signal.macro * weights.macro) +
    (signal.flow * weights.flow) +
    (signal.sentiment * weights.sentiment);
}
```

## Execution Layer

- Regime classifier updates positioning tiers (risk-on, neutral, hedge) for FX, indices, and crypto baskets.
- Hedging bounds push to automation, adjusting stop corridors and basis allocations within two minutes of a regime flip.
- Analysts receive autogenerated talking points, enabling human nuance before the briefing is released to 9,200+ members.

## Outcomes

- **Faster alignment** – Portfolio stance changes propagate to every automation policy in 110 seconds on average.
- **Higher adoption** – 82% of members open the briefing within the first hour, and 63% enable auto-hedge sync.
- **Risk discipline** – Drawdown variance narrowed by 18% across portfolios that follow the outlook tiers versus discretionary peers.

The Dynamic Market Outlook has become the morning command center: mentorship, automation, and treasury teams speak the same language and pivot together.
