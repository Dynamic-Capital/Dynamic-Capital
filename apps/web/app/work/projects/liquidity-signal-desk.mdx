## Objectives

We needed a repeatable way to deliver institutional-grade trade ideas, risk guidance, and automation support to thousands of members without sacrificing quality. The desk had to merge human insight with strict risk governance.

## Outcomes

- **Launch velocity** – New members complete onboarding within 72 hours, including risk alignment and automation setup.
- **Signal fidelity** – Analysts publish through structured forms that enforce stop, target, and conviction fields, reducing ambiguity for members.
- **Transparency** – A live performance dashboard tracks win rate, average R, and equity curves for every portfolio, refreshed in near real time.

## Stack

- Telegram for member distribution and escalation
- Supabase for CRM, risk registry, and automation logs
- Next.js + Dynamic UI for the desk portal
- Redis streams for high-speed signal routing

The result is a desk where members feel guided by humans but protected by systems. Mentors focus on strategy while automation handles execution and reporting.
