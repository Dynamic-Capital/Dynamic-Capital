Our desks lean on a live commodities heat map to surface momentum without combing through every individual chart. Each tile shows how a contract is behaving across stacked timeframes so we can size trades and hedges inside minutes instead of hours.

## Live commodities heat map snapshot

As of **25 September 2025 at 06:30 GMT+5**, the board highlighted strength in grains and metals while energy rotated lower:

- **All timeframes trending higher:** CORNF, Copper, NGAS, SOYF, UKOil, USOil, WHEATF, XAG/USD, XAU/USD.
- **Contracts under review:** We monitor anything that flips out of the strong cohort for two consecutive sessions to confirm whether the move is a rotation or noise.

The grid updates every few seconds and keeps the latest values pinned at the top so execution teams can react without refreshing dashboards.

## How to read the colors

Each tile compares the current bar to the previous one on the selected timeframe. That context turns a simple uptick or downtick into a read on trend strength:

1. **Dark green** – Price is above the prior bar’s high, signalling a decisive breakout.
2. **Light green** – Price closed above the previous bar but remains inside its range; momentum is positive but still constrained.
3. **Gray** – Price is flat versus the previous close; stand aside until the tape resolves.
4. **Light red** – Price slipped below the prior close yet held the low, indicating early distribution.
5. **Dark red** – Price pierced the prior low and is accelerating lower.

Stacking multiple timeframes side-by-side prevents tunnel vision. When CORNF prints dark green on the hourly, four-hour, and daily views simultaneously, we label the bias as **strongly bullish**. If only the hourly flashes green while higher timeframes stay muted, we treat it as a range-bound bounce instead of a trend.

## Bullish and bearish playbooks

The heat map isn’t a trade signal by itself. It tells us when to zoom in on a chart and validate structure.

### Bullish reads

- **Strongly bullish #1:** Price breaks above the prior high on every tracked timeframe. We stage scale-in orders with defined risk and let automation trail stops under the most recent swing low.
- **Strongly bullish #2:** A contract closes above the previous bar on higher timeframes while intraday prints dark green. This supports adding exposure via call spreads or rolling spot hedges.
- **Bullish #1:** A fresh daily close above the prior close, even if intraday remains range-bound. We mark it for follow-up and watch for confirmation on the next session.
- **Bullish #2:** Intraday timeframes flash light green while the daily is flat. We tighten risk and wait for the higher timeframe breakout before deploying capital.

### Bearish reads

- **Strongly bearish #1:** Each timeframe closes below the prior low. We rotate into protective puts or trim long beta immediately.
- **Strongly bearish #2:** Higher timeframes sit below prior closes and intraday bars print dark red. Momentum desks lean into short continuations with predefined take-profit targets.
- **Bearish #1:** Only intraday closes below the prior close; we treat it as a warning and cut position size.
- **Bearish #2:** Price probes below the previous low but snaps back before the close. We log it as a potential liquidity grab and wait for confirmation.
