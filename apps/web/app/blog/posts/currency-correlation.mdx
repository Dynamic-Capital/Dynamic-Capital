Use our Currency Correlation tool to find the least or most correlated major currency pairs.

## What is currency correlation?

Currency correlation measures how closely the price movements of two different currency pairs are connected. It shows whether they tend to travel in the same direction, diverge, or move independently of each other. If you plan to trade several forex pairs at once, understanding how they interact keeps you from doubling risk without noticing.

## Types of correlation

- **Positive correlation:** Both currency pairs usually move in the same direction. For example, when **EUR/USD** rallies, **GBP/USD** often rallies alongside it.
- **Negative correlation:** The pairs typically move in opposite directions. A rising **EUR/USD** often coincides with a falling **USD/CHF**.
- **No correlation:** The pairs move randomly relative to each other, so gains or losses in one have no consistent relationship to the other.

## How correlation is measured

Correlation is typically expressed as a coefficient between **-1** and **+1**:

- **+1.0** – Perfect positive correlation. The pairs move together 100% of the time.
- **0.0** – No discernible relationship. Movements are independent.
- **-1.0** – Perfect negative correlation. The pairs mirror each other in opposite directions every time.

The closer the coefficient is to either extreme, the more reliable the relationship. Values near zero suggest randomness, while anything above ±0.80 or below ±0.80 signals a strong connection worth factoring into your trade plan.

## Why traders track correlation

- **Reduce risk concentration:** Pair trades with low or negative correlation to prevent one market move from hurting every position at once.
- **Avoid overexposure:** Multiple trades in highly correlated pairs can multiply both gains and losses. A single macro event could hit all of them the same way.
- **Spot opportunity clusters:** If one positively correlated pair is breaking out, its partner may soon follow and offer a second entry.
- **Hedge deliberately:** Opening positions in negatively correlated pairs can offset drawdowns without fully flattening exposure.

## A practical example

Going long **EUR/USD** and **GBP/USD** at the same time is effectively one macro bet. If the U.S. dollar suddenly strengthens, both trades may lose together. Flipping one of those positions—long **GBP/USD**, short **EUR/USD**—dampens that directional risk because the pairs often move together. You may not capture a big profit, but you keep your P&L from swinging wildly in a single market shock.

## What shifts currency correlation?

- **Economic ties:** Countries with similar trade profiles or policy decisions often have currencies that trend together.
- **Shared base or quote currencies:** Pairs that share a currency (like EUR/USD and EUR/JPY) inherit some of the same drivers.
- **Risk sentiment swings:** In periods of stress, traders flock to safe havens such as the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen, changing correlation patterns across the board.

> **Remember:** Correlation is descriptive, not causal. Financial markets are complex, and a shared move does not mean one pair caused the other to move. Monitor our Currency Correlation tool frequently because coefficients evolve with monetary policy, geopolitical shifts, and sentiment.

Keeping a live read on correlations turns your watchlist into a coordinated portfolio instead of a random basket of trades.
