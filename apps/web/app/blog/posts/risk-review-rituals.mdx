Discipline is the differentiator between the traders who scale and those who churn. We run three structured reviews every week to keep members aligned with their plan.

## Monday: Playbook alignment

We meet as a cohort to compare upcoming catalysts with open risk. Each member submits their active plans and desired size. Mentors flag positions that violate the plan or exceed risk limits.

## Wednesday: Emotional checkpoint

Midweek we run a 15-minute async survey in Telegram that asks for:

- Stress level (1-5)
- Adherence to stop discipline
- Any revenge trades or impulse scalps

Members who flag issues are invited to a 1:1 mentor call the same day.

## Friday: Performance debrief

We export automation logs and manual fills to Supabase, then build a narrative of what worked and what did not. Every trader records a Loom covering:

1. A trade they executed perfectly
2. A trade they would redo, and the mindset behind it
3. The adjustment for next week

The loop keeps everyone honest. When you articulate decisions publicly, you are far less likely to let emotions hijack the next session.
