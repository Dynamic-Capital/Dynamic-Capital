Mentorship is often treated as inspiration. We treat it like product design. Every sprint is structured so members leave with new behaviours, not just notes.

## Week 1 – Diagnose

Mentor and member audit prior trades together, tag the root causes of mistakes, and define one metric to improve. It could be average R, drawdown recovery time, or signal adherence.

## Week 2 – Prototype

We co-create experiments: automation tweaks, checklists, or journaling prompts. The member implements them in a sandbox account before promoting to live capital.

## Week 3 – Stress test

During live sessions the mentor monitors in real time, using Telegram voice notes to course correct. We intentionally introduce simulated stress—news shocks, slippage—to see how the system responds.

## Week 4 – Ship & measure

We ship the new workflow into daily routine and schedule a follow-up 30 days later. The mentor only considers the sprint successful if the original metric moves in the right direction *and* the member reports lower cognitive load.

This structure ensures mentorship time compounds. Every sprint leaves traders with a stronger system instead of a motivational high that fades in days.
