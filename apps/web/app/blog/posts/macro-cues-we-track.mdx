Before any analyst tags a trade as high conviction, they must walk through a shared macro checklist. It keeps our desks aligned even when opinions differ.

## Liquidity heatmap

We start with a simple question: *where is liquidity migrating?* Using aggregated order book data we map:

- Net flow into or out of the dollar
- Stablecoin issuance across major chains
- Cross-border capital controls that could skew FX pairs

## Catalyst timeline

We overlay the upcoming week of catalysts—central bank decisions, CPI prints, energy inventory releases—against existing positions. No trade is isolated; it lives inside a timeline that may accelerate or invalidate it.

## Quant confirmation

The final gate is quantitative:

```python
from once.analytics import volatility_band

signal = volatility_band(asset="XAUUSD", window=14)
if signal.confirm_trend(direction="long") and signal.deviation < 1.5:
    approve_trade()
```

Only when discretionary structure, catalysts, and quantitative confirmation align do we publish the signal to members.
