"""Dynamic Bots helpers and integrations.

Only a handful of bot helpers exist today, primarily the Telegram
integration used for trade and operations notifications.  This wrapper
provides a consistent entry-point that mirrors other ``dynamic_*``
packages and unlocks imports such as ``from dynamic_bots import
DynamicTelegramBot`` without reaching into the ``integrations`` module
structure.
