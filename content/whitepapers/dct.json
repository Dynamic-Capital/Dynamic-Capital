    "Dynamic Capital Token (DCT) is the proof-of-contribution asset that powers the Dynamic Capital intelligence network on The Open Network (TON). It unlocks trading intelligence, AGI mentorship, and execution tooling for contributors that actively strengthen the platform.",
    "DCT rewards measurable improvements to the protocol. Optimization and refinement loops run back-to-back: contributors earn emissions by training models, operating infrastructure, and onboarding users, while treasury alignment and burn mechanics reinforce long-term scarcity and liquidity depth."

  "tokenomics": {
    "intro": [
      "DCT tokenomics align emissions with meaningful contribution. Supply is permanently capped at 100,000,000 DCT, governed by a time-locked multisig with on-chain referendums required for any monetary change. Forty percent of supply flows through a proof-of-contribution program that scores model training, usage, and impact; emissions decay across three phases (Years 1\u20132, 3\u20134, 5\u20136) so rewards concentrate around early ecosystem building while still backing long-term growth.",
      "At genesis, 13% of supply enters circulation: 3% funds community quests that seed Phase I, 5% bootstraps liquidity on TON venues, 2% powers partnership pilots, and 3% shores up the strategic reserve. Team, investor, and ecosystem allocations vest on-chain with transparent cliffs (team: 12-month cliff, 48-month linear; investors: 6-month cliff, 36-month linear; ecosystem: milestone-triggered releases over 36 months). The treasury and R&D budget streams linearly across 60 months with pause rights controlled by governance."

    "policies": [
      "Proof-of-Training, Proof-of-Usage, and Proof-of-Impact pools distribute 45%, 35%, and 20% of each month\u2019s community budget respectively, ensuring high-quality data, live network activity, and ecosystem contributions are all compensated.",
      "Emission buckets inside each phase decay exponentially (E_m = E_0 \u00b7 e^{-k m} with k ranging from 0.08 to 0.12) to discourage spam farming while keeping rewards available for sustained performance.",
      "Deflationary sinks remove up to 50% of protocol fees via burns, route 30% of DCT-denominated API spend to burns (the remaining 70% cycles to the treasury), and slash malicious contributors with 100% burn penalties."
