    "Dynamic Capital TON Coin (DCT) is the on-chain utility token that powers the Dynamic Capital ecosystem on The Open Network (TON). The asset enables permissionless access to quantitative trading signals, liquidity coordination, and governance.",
    "DCT is engineered to align incentives between strategy contributors, capital providers, and the treasury so that protocol growth directly benefits active participants. This document outlines the economic model, supply schedule, and token utilities that underpin the Dynamic Capital flywheel."

  "tokenomics": {
    "intro": [
      "DCT tokenomics are meticulously designed to balance protocol liquidity with long-run alignment between traders, contributors, and the treasury. The supply is hard capped at 100,000,000 DCT under a time-locked multi-signature controller; any future adjustments require an on-chain governance vote with delayed execution safeguards. This mirrors the deployment configuration for the jetton, anchoring monetary policy in auditable on-chain parameters.",
      "At launch, circulating supply is constrained to the public circulation allocation that fuels community growth initiatives alongside the dedicated liquidity provision buffer. Treasury, team, advisor, staking, and liquidity allocations are escrowed in TON vesting contracts with transparent cliffs and drip schedules that mirror the table below. Unlock schedules are published ahead of time, and governance can pause or re-sequence emissions if security or market stability concerns arise."
    ],
    "policies": [
      "Treasury policies route a governed share of protocol fees toward buybacks and liquidity programs, reinforcing price stability while re-circulating value to active contributors.",
      "Additional sink mechanics—staking lock-ups, vault fees denominated in DCT, and programmatic burns triggered by slashing or inactivity—offset new issuance and anchor a deflationary bias over time.",
      "Circulating supply dashboards provide real-time unlock calendars and burn totals to maintain transparency."
