# Knowledge Base Drops
<!-- DO NOT EDIT: generated by scripts/knowledge_base/sync-readme.ts -->

This directory mirrors curated corpora published to the shared OneDrive `knowledge_base/` folder. Each subdirectory corresponds to a dated drop and contains the artifacts required for retrieval-augmented training.

Run `npx tsx scripts/knowledge_base/sync-readme.ts` after updating `index.json` to refresh this overview.

### Maintenance notes

- Update `index.json` whenever new OneDrive manifests or mirrored corpora are added, then re-run the sync script to regenerate this overview.
- Commit the refreshed "README.md" alongside any new manifests, metadata snapshots, or dataset files to keep the knowledge base discoverable.

- **Status:** Anonymous access is still blocked; authenticate with Microsoft Graph before enumerating contents. Once fetched, mirror the artifacts into data/knowledge_base/ and extend the research manifest with filenames, checksums, and processing notes.

#### Next actions

- Export a Microsoft Graph access token with permission to read the shared item.
- Run npx tsx scripts/onedrive/dump-drive-item.ts "${ONEDRIVE_SHARE_LINK}" docs/onedrive-shares/erbhfycq-folder.metadata.json after authentication.
- Mirror the downloaded assets into data/knowledge_base/ and update the manifests with checksums and processing notes.

### Research staging

- **Source location:** `OneDrive\\DynamicAI_DB\\knowledge_base\\research`
- **Supabase mirror:** `public.one_drive_assets/knowledge_base/research/*`
- **Description:** New research datasets have been uploaded to OneDrive and are waiting on checksum validation before we promote them into the shared retrieval corpus. Track synchronization steps and dataset notes in the research/README.md control file.
