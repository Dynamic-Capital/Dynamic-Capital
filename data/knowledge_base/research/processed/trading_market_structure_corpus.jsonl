{"prompt": "Summarize the \"Understanding Market Structure\" slide for Dynamic Capital's market structure corpus.", "response": "Structure proves price is purposeful, not random. The slide distils four principles: order flow intent becomes visible once you map structure; high-energy swings reveal where liquidity concentrates; trends persist until counter-order flow intervenes (Wyckoff and Newton echo the point); and markets cycle through balance, imbalance, and rebalancing depending on liquidity depth. Operating summary: (1) Aggressive buyers stretch upswings and compress pullbacks. (2) Dominant sellers extend downswings while bounces stay muted. (3) When pressure balances, price ranges until a fresh imbalance breaks the deadlock.", "context": "Source: Market structure slide deck — Understanding Market Structure\nScope: Trading psychology, equilibrium, and liquidity notes", "language": "en", "tags": ["trading", "market_structure", "education"]}
{"prompt": "Explain the \"Market Structure Concept\" taxonomy referenced in the training slides.", "response": "The taxonomy is a five-tier hierarchy that keeps analysis consistent across time horizons. Primary/long-term trends (months to years) map weekly or monthly HH/HL or LH/LL structure and anchor macro bias. Secondary/intermediate swings (weeks to a few months) rebalance primary liquidity, so expect deeper pullbacks or relief rallies. Intermediate flow (several sessions) carries the dominant direction into tactical plans. Short-term structure (days to weeks) defines trade direction within the intermediate trend. Tertiary or intraday structure (hours to days) often fades the active push and is used to refine entries. Bullish readings print higher lows across tiers; bearish readings print lower highs. Default to the daily chart as your compass unless higher tiers neutralise.", "context": "Source: Market structure slide deck — Market Structure Concept\nScope: Trend hierarchy and behavioural cues", "language": "en", "tags": ["trading", "market_structure", "taxonomy"]}
{"prompt": "Document the \"Trading with Market Structure\" guidance and checklist from the slide deck.", "response": "Execution starts with bias discipline: bullish regimes invite retests of prior structure before continuation, while bearish regimes revisit prior lows—countertrend trades demand higher-time-frame neutrality or a confirmed shift. Focus on equilibrium, key supports/resistances, and liquidity pools; the first countertrend candle after expansion often defines entry and stop placement. The 12-point execution discipline groups into alignment (anchor weekly/daily bias, wait for agreement before scaling), trade selection (intermediate swings book profits, short-term swings drive continuation, buy pullbacks in bull markets, sell lower highs in bear markets, track USD/DXY context), risk management (predefine invalidation, carry validated levels forward, document management actions), and execution hygiene (let higher structure guide intraday timing and log observations after each session).", "context": "Source: Market structure slide deck — Trading with Market Structure\nScope: Strategy guidance and execution discipline", "language": "en", "tags": ["trading", "market_structure", "execution"]}
{"prompt": "Capture the \"General Principles of Chart Reading\" from the market structure slides.", "response": "Decide the operating timeframe first; indicators serve the structural narrative, not the other way around. Always stack at least three timeframes: Monthly→Weekly→Daily for position traders, Daily→H4→H1 for swing traders, and H4→H1→M15 for intraday teams. Workflow: start with the Monthly map, step through Weekly and Daily, then consult intraday charts (H4, M15, M5) while keeping higher tiers visible so context is preserved during execution.", "context": "Source: Market structure slide deck — General Principles of Chart Reading\nScope: Multi-time-frame philosophy and workflows", "language": "en", "tags": ["trading", "market_structure", "process"]}
{"prompt": "Summarise the \"Keys to Multiple Time Frames Trading\" slide for internal training.", "response": "Focus priorities: (1) Highest timeframe defines directional bias. (2) Intermediate timeframe refines bias-aligned entries. (3) Lower timeframe delivers precise execution and management. Alignment checks: prioritise setups near major support/resistance, ensure higher and intermediate tiers agree before risking capital, and only drop lower once those tiers are synced. Routine habits include tracking five-day rolling ranges, keeping daily structure aligned with weekly/monthly context, understanding broader price drivers before reacting intraday, reviewing how price cycled through prior ranges and last week's extremes, and anchoring expectations with weekly Fibonacci levels and key transitions.", "context": "Source: Market structure slide deck — Keys to Multiple Time Frames Trading\nScope: Focus areas for multi-time-frame alignment", "language": "en", "tags": ["trading", "market_structure", "multi_time_frame"]}
{"prompt": "Outline the \"Daily Time Frame\" checklist referenced in the market structure deck.", "response": "Daily playbook: Objective—set directional bias and sketch the structural landscape.
