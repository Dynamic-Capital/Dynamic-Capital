{"prompt": "Summarize the \"Understanding Market Structure\" slide for Dynamic Capital's market structure corpus.", "response": "Is the market random? Only when decisions ignore structure. The slide clarifies that market structure exposes the intent behind order flow, shows why reactive pivots advertise liquidity, and reminds us that consensus fades until a new imbalance appears. It ties Wyckoff's and Newton's laws to the idea that trends persist until counter-order flow forces a shift. Liquidity and imbalance are the drivers: the market oscillates between balance, imbalance, and a return to balance based on who controls the auction.\n\nIn summary:\n- When buyers are more aggressive than sellers, upswings last longer than the pullbacks.\n- When sellers are in control, downswings extend while retracements stay shallow.\n- When pressure is balanced, swings look random because the market is ranging.", "context": "Source: Market structure slide deck — Understanding Market Structure\nScope: Trading psychology, equilibrium, and liquidity notes", "language": "en", "tags": ["trading", "market_structure", "education"]}
{"prompt": "Document the \"Trading with Market Structure\" guidance and checklist from the slide deck.", "response": "The trading guidance instructs you to plan for retests of prior structure in bullish phases and to expect revisits of previous lows in bearish ones. Always align directional bias with the higher-time-frame structure, anticipate reactions at key support, resistance, and equilibrium zones, and look for the first countertrend candle after expansions to stage entries. Focus on bodies that reveal imbalance, study prior ranges for liquidity grabs, and manage each position with disciplined scaling around structural signals.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n1. Bullish structure features price breaking previous highs and respecting prior lows.\n2. Bearish structure features price breaking previous lows and respecting prior highs.\n3. Intermediate swings take profits; short-term swings target direction alignment for continuation.\n4. Anchor bias to the weekly and daily structure before drilling down.\n5. Stand aside on lower time frames until the higher structure turns neutral or supportive.\n6. Allow higher time frame structure to coordinate with intraday entries.\n7. Trade with the higher-time-frame bias during bullish regimes and fade rallies cautiously.\n8. During bearish regimes, only take sells that align with the higher structure and the most recent short-term break of structure.\n9. Wait for daily and weekly trends to align before loading aggressive positions.\n10. In bullish regimes, focus on buying pullbacks to higher lows instead of selling into strength.\n11. In bearish regimes, prioritise selling lower highs instead of buying into weakness.\n12. Track the Dollar Index and correlated macro drivers for confluence while the structure plays out.", "context": "Source: Market structure slide deck — Trading with Market Structure\nScope: Strategy guidance and the 12-point reminder list", "language": "en", "tags": ["trading", "market_structure", "execution"]}
{"prompt": "Explain the \"Market Structure Concept\" taxonomy referenced in the training slides.", "response": "Market structure is defined by imbalances of buying and selling pressure; those imbalances reveal whether price is defending higher levels or pressing toward new lows. The hierarchy aligns order flow and liquidity across time frames and warns that short-term swings can be manipulated, so execution must follow the higher-time-frame bias.\n\nTrend tiers:\n- Primary / Long-Term Trend — Lasting months to many years with higher highs and higher lows in bull phases or lower highs and lower lows in bear phases.\n- Secondary (Intermediate) Trend — Weeks to a few months moving against the primary trend while building or relieving liquidity.\n- Intermediate-Term Flow — Short-term highs and lows that align with the dominant direction and bridge primary context with intraday execution.\n- Short-Term Trend — Days to weeks inside the intermediate structure, printing fresh short-term highs or lows relative to the prior swing.\n- Tertiary Trend — Hours to days, often counter to the short-term direction, and used to fine tune entries.\n\nShort-term bullish behaviour prints higher lows relative to both preceding and following swings. Short-term bearish behaviour prints lower highs relative to both swings. Treat the daily structure as the baseline: go long in bullish regimes and short in bearish regimes.", "context": "Source: Market structure slide deck — Market Structure Concept\nScope: Trend hierarchy and behavioural cues", "language": "en", "tags": ["trading", "market_structure", "taxonomy"]}
