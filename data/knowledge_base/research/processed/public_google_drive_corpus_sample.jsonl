It will take some time to read \nand memorize all the know-how so it is important that before you start reading this book you make sure that trading is suited for you. Here are the three principles to help understand if trading is the right path for you.\n1. Trade with free resources\nNever trade money that you can't aﬀord to lose. If you don’t have resources you can aﬀord to lose, then trading might not be for you yet.\n2. Try before you invest your time \nI always recommend my students to play around in user-friendly trading environments before jumping to books and complicated trading systems. I have come across some great and beginner-friendly platforms where you can \nlearn straight from the pros and even copy their trades thus letting them make money for you. /T_his is currently the best network to open free accounts in - Social Investment Network.\n2. Determine your risk appetite\nTrading involves risk and /f_inancial trading is not for people with low stress tolerance. Fortunately there is a tool for minimizing the risks - stop loss order which helps to leverage the exposure to risks and stress for people with higher risk appetite.\nINTRODUCTION\n1ou can be free. You can live and work anywhere in the world, be \nindependent from the routine and not answer to anybody.” With \nthose words I began my /f_irst book, Trading for a Living. One of my great \npleasures in the years since its publication has been meeting and becoming friends with people who became free thanks to successful trading. Several times a year I run a Traders’ Camp, a week of intensive classes at remote resorts. I enjoy my campers’ successes. A stockbroker became a full-time trader, closed his business, and moved to Rio to pursue a life-long interest in Latin women. A psychologist became such a successful options writer that she paid for an early retirement for her husband and moved with him to the Virgin Islands to become an expert in what she calls synchronous hammocking. A man bought a mountain in Vermont and trades from the house he built on its top. I wish all students could succeed, but it’s not that simple. How many psychiatrists does it take to change a lightbulb? Only one—but the bulb has to want to change. To succeed in trading you need several innate traits without which you shouldn’t even start. /T_hey include discipline, risk tolerance, and facility with numbers. A big fat guy who is o/f_ten drunk and can’t kick a cigarette habit is unlikely to make a good trader—he lacks discipline. A nitpicker who obsesses over each dime is too tense to live with market risks. A daydreamer who cannot do simple arithmetic on the run becomes lost when prices change rapidly. In addition to discipline, risk tolerance, and ease with numbers, successful trading requires 3 M’s—Mind, Method, and Money. Mind means developing psychological rules that will keep you calm amidst the\nnoise of the markets. Method is a system of analyzing prices and\ndeveloping a decision-making tree. Money refers to money manage-ment, which means risking only a small part of your trading capital onany trade; think of the way a submarine is divided into many com-partments so that it won’t sink if one section becomes flooded—youhave to structure your account this way. Psychology, trading tactics,money management—you can learn these skills.\nHow long will it take you to become a competent trader and how\nmuch will it cost? What rules do you set, what methods do you use,and how do you split your trading capital? What should you study first,second, and third? What markets should you trade, and how muchmoney can you expect to make? If these questions interest you, youpicked the right book.\nYou can succeed in trading. It has been done before, and it’s being\ndone right now, today, by people who started from scratch, learned totrade and are making a good living at it. The best ones make fortunes.Others fail, out of ignorance or lack of discipline. If you work throughthis book, ignorance will not be a problem, and you will hear me yellat you again and again, pointing you towards disciplined, responsible,professional trading.\nTrading is a journey of self-discovery. If you enjoy learning, if you\nare not scared of risk, if the rewards appeal to you, if you are preparedto put in the work, you have a great project ahead of you. You willwork hard and enjoy the discoveries you’ll make along the way.\nI wish you success. Now let us begin.\nHOWTHISBOOKISORGANIZED\nBooks written from the heart acquire their own direction. They developand change in the process of being written. You start with a plan, butthe book takes over, and before you know it, you’re going much far-ther than planned.\nI began writing this book three years ago on a flight to New York,\nreturning from a Traders’ Camp in Mexico. We had more beginnersthan usual, many of them women. They kept asking for a book thatthey jokingly called Trading for Dummies . There were no dummies in\nour group. Those campers were smart, sharp, and motivated—but theyneeded to learn the rules and the tools. I figured I would write a brief2 INTRODUCTION\npractical introduction, call it Financial Trading for Babes in the Woods ,\nand be done by Christmas.\nThree Christmases passed before I completed my project. The beginner\npart was easy, but I kept tunneling into the depths of trading, sharingwhat I learned in the nine years since Trading for a Living was pub-\nlished. I developed new indicators and systems. My money managementbecame crisper, and I designed a new approach to record keeping. Mywork with hundreds of traders showed me how to teach people to turntheir trading lives around and move from haphazard jumping in andout to a calm professional style. Take a few minutes to read how thisbook is organized, so that you may get full value out of it.\nPart One, Financial Trading for Babes in the Woods , is written pri-\nmarily for those who are just becoming interested in trading. It laysout topics whose mastery is essential for success and puts up dangersigns around the main pitfalls. Even experienced traders would do wellto review this chapter, especially the concept of external barriers tosuccess, which has never before been spelled out in trading literature,and the critique of the efficient market theory.\nPart Two, The Three M’s of Successful Trading , teaches you the\nthree key aspects of trading—Mind, Method, and Money. Mind isyour trading psychology. Method is how you go about finding tradesand making entry and exit decisions. Money is how you manage yourtrading capital for long-term survival and success. Once we reviewthe psychological rules, I’ll share with you my favorite analytic tools,some of which I have never before revealed. We will cover systemtesting, day-trading, and a new method for placing stops. The step-by-step money management strategy has never before appeared intrading literature.\nPart Three, Come into My Trading Room , delivers another first—a set\nof exact instructions for organizing your time and effort, as well askeeping good records. Proper record keeping is a hallmark of suc-cessful trading. Good records help you learn from your mistakes aswell as victories. You know you should keep records, but now you’llsee exactly how to do it. By the time you work through this section,nobody can call you “a babe in the woods.”\nTake your time as you read this book, mark it up, return to the sec-\ntions that interest you most. This volume distills 20 years of trading andteaching experience. It took three years to write, and it will probablyINTRODUCTION 3\ntake more than one reading to get its full value. Open your charting\nsoftware, pull out your trading records, test all the concepts on yourown data. Only testing will make these ideas your own.\nBy the time you leave my trading room, you’ll be in a position to take\nyour trading to a higher, more intelligent, and successful level. \nMALE OR FEMALE ?\nAlmost every nonfiction writer faces the dilemma—which pronoun touse. He? She? He or she?\nMale traders outnumber women by about twenty to one, although\nthis ratio is rapidly becoming more balanced as more and more womencome into the markets. In our Traders’ Camps, which attract the moresophisticated segment of traders, we have already moved from a greatpreponderance of men to a near parity with women.\nI find that the percentage of successful traders is higher among\nwomen. They tend to be less arrogant, and arrogance is a deadly sinin trading. The male ego—that wonderful trait that has been bringingus wars, riots, and bloodshed since time immemorial—tends to getheavily caught up in trading. A guy studies his charts, decides to buy,and now his self-esteem is involved—he has to be right! If the marketgoes his way, he waits to be proven even more right—bigger is better.If the market goes against him, he is tough enough to stand the painand waits for the market to reverse and prove him right—while itgrinds down his account.\nWomen traders, on the other hand, are much more likely to ask a sim-\nple question—where’s the money? They like to take profits and focus onavoiding losses instead of trying to prove themselves right. Women aremore likely to bend with the wind and go with the flow, catch trendsand hop off a little earlier, booking profits. When I tell traders that keep-ing records is a hugely important aspect of success, women are morelikely to keep them than men. If you are looking to hire a trader, all otherfactors being equal, I’d recommend looking for a woman.\nStill, there are many more male than female traders. The English lan-\nguage being what it is, “he” flows better than “he or she” or even jump-ing between the two pronouns. To make reading easier, I’ll use themasculine pronoun throughout this book. I trust you understand that nodisrespect is intended toward women traders. I want to make this bookeasier to read for everybody, of any gender, anywhere in the world.4 INTRODUCTION\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nPART\nONE\nFINANCIAL\nTRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nAre traders born or made? There is no simple answer. Both aptitude\nand learning are important, but in different proportions for differ-\nent people. At one extreme are born geniuses who require very littlelearning. At the other are gamblers and dunces, whom no classes arelikely to help. The rest of us are in the middle of the curve, with someaptitude but in need of education.\nA genius has little need for a book because he has a fantastic feel\nfor the market. A gambler is too busy getting high on adrenaline. Thisbook is written for the trader in the middle.\nCHAPTER\nONE\nINVEST?\nTRADE?GAMBLE?\nAnewcomer to the market faces three paths that lead into a forest\nfull of treasures and dangers. The first path, for investors, goes\nthrough the sunniest areas. Most of those who take it come out alive,if not much richer. Another path, for traders, leads into the heart of theforest. Many travelers disappear, but those who come out look rich.The third is a shortcut that takes gamblers into the swamp.\nHow can you tell which path is which? You must choose your way\ncarefully because if you don’t, you’ll end up on the gamblers’ path,especially since it crosses both investors’ and traders’ trails. We’ll returnto this question in the chapters on trading psychology.\nANINTELLIGENT INVESTOR\nInvestors profit by recognizing new trends in the economy and buyinginto them before the majority wakes up to opportunities. A knowl-edgeable investor can earn huge percentage gains by holding his posi-tion without being terribly active.\nBack in the 1970s, I bought stock in a company called KinderCare,\nwhich ran a chain of child care centers. It tried to make them as uni-form and reliable as McDonalds’ hamburgers. KinderCare catered to babyboomers who were having babies right, left, and center. Half of myfriends were pregnant at that time. A major social shift was taking placein the United States, with women going to work in record numbers.Someone had to mind the babies of all those two-income families, andthe stock of KinderCare soared on the crest of a new social trend.\nAT&T used to have a monopoly on long-distance phone calls. Then\nin the late 1970s a tiny brash upstart called MCI won a legal dogfight,\n7\nallowing it to compete with AT&T. The age of deregulation was upon\nus, and the stock of MCI—the first company into the breach—sold for$3 presenting another great opportunity to hop aboard a new trend.\nA few years ago I flew into New York from the Caribbean with my\nfriend George. He became a millionaire by buying $30,000 worth of Dellstock before most people had heard of the company—and unloading itat the top three years later with the help of technical analysis. Sprawledin his first-class seat, George was perusing several investment advisories,trying to lock in on the next trend in Internet technology. How right hewas! Within a year Internet stocks were flying, defying gravity.\nThat’s the lure of investing. If you can buy a chunk of Dell at $4 a\nshare and cash out at $80 a few years later, it is easy to fly down to a re-sort for a week rather than sit in front of a monitor watching every tick.\nWhat are the disadvantages? Investing requires a great deal of patience\nand an immense supply of self-confidence. To buy Chrysler after it wasrescued from the brink of bankruptcy or Internet search engines beforeanyone knew what those words meant, you had to have a huge level ofconfidence in your ability to read the trends in society and the e conomy.\nAll of us are smart after the fact; very few are smart early in the game, andonly the tiniest percentage has the emotional strength to make a large beton their vision and hold on to it. Those who can do this consistently,like Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch, are hailed as superstars.\nANINTELLIGENT TRADER\nTraders make money by betting on short-term price swings. The ideais to buy when our reading of the market tells us prices are rising andsell when the uptrend runs out of steam. Alternatively, we can bet ona decline and sell short when our analysis points to a downtrend, cov-ering when the downtrend starts bottoming out. The concept is simple,but implementing it is difficult.\nIt is hard to become a good analyst, but harder to become a good trader.\nBeginners often assume they can make money because they’re smart,computer-literate and have a record of success in business. You can get afast computer and even buy a backtested system from a vendor, but put-ting money on it is like trying to sit on a three-legged stool with two legsmissing. The two other factors are psychology and money management.\nBalancing your mind is just as important as analyzing markets. Your\npersonality influences your perceptions, making it a key aspect of yoursuccess or failure. Managing money in your trading account is essential8 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nfor surviving the inevitable drawdowns and prospering in the long run.\nPsychology, market analysis, and money management—you have to mas-ter all three to become a success.\nThere are two main approaches to profiting from crowd behavior. The\nfirst is momentum trading—buy when a ripple starts running through thecrowd, sending the market higher, and sell when that ripple starts losingspeed. It is a challenge to identify a new trend while it’s still young. Asthe trend speeds up and the crowd becomes exuberant, amateurs fall inlove with their positions. Professionals remain calm and monitor thetrend’s speed. As soon as they find that the crowd is returning to its nor-mal sleepiness, they take profits without waiting for a reversal.\nThe other method is the countertrend strategy. It involves betting\nagainst the deviations and for a return to normalcy. Countertrendtraders sell short when an upside breakout starts running out of speedand cover when a downtrend starts petering out. Beginners love totrade against trends (“let’s buy, this market can’t go any lower!”), butmost get impaled on a price spike that fails to reverse. A man who likespeeing against the wind has no right to complain about his cleaningbills. Professionals can trade against trends only because they are readyto run at the first sign of trouble. Before you bet on a reversal, be sureyour exit strategy and money management are fine-tuned.\nMomentum traders and countertrend traders capitalize on two oppo-\nsite aspects of crowd behavior. Before you put on a trade, be sure toknow whether you’re investing, momentum trading, or countertrendtrading. Once you’ve entered a trade, manage it as planned! Don’tchange your tactics in the midst of a trade because then you’ll con-tribute to the winners’ welfare fund.\nAmateurs keep thinking what trades to get into, while professionals\nspend just as much time figuring out their exits. They also focus onmoney management, calculating what size positions they can affordunder current market conditions, whether to pyramid, when to takepartial profits, and so on. They also spend a great deal of time keep-ing good records of their trades.\nThe Efficient Market Theory\nA trader strains his mind, his soul, his entire being trying to take prof-its out of the market when an unsettling piece of news comes downthe pike—the efficient market theory. Its main adherents are academ-ics, who are fond of pointing out that prices reflect all available mar-INVEST? TRADE? GAMBLE? 9\nket information. People buy and sell on the basis of their knowledge,\nand the latest price represents everything known about that market.This is a valid observation, from which the efficient market gang drawsthe curious conclusion that no one can beat the market. Markets knoweverything, they say, and trading is like playing chess against someonewho knows more than you. Don’t waste your time and money—simplyindex your portfolio and select stocks based on volatility.\nWhat about traders who make money? The efficient market theorists\nsay that winners are plain lucky. Most people make money at somepoint, before bleeding it back into the markets. What about thosewho keep outperforming markets year after year? Warren Buffett, oneof the twentieth century’s great investors, says that investing in a mar-ket in which people believe in efficiency is like playing poker againstthose who believe it does not pay to look at cards.\nI think that the efficient market theory offers one of the truest views of\nthe markets. I also believe it is one of the largest pieces of theoreticalgarbage. The theory correctly observes that markets reflect the intelli-gence of all crowd members; it is fatally flawed in assuming that investorsand traders are rational human beings who always strive to maximizegains and minimize losses. That is a very idealized view of human nature.\nMost traders can be rational on a fine weekend when the markets\nare closed. They calmly study their charts and decide what to buy andsell, where to take profits, and when to cut losses. When the marketsopen on Monday, the best laid plans of mice and men get ripped upin the sweaty palms of traders.\nTrading and investing are partly rational and partly emotional. People\noften act on an impulse even if they harm themselves in the process ofdoing so. A winning gambler brags about his positions and misses sellsignals. A fearful trader beaten up by the market becomes cautiousbeyond measure. As soon as his stock ticks down a bit, he sells, violat-ing his own rules. When that stock rises, overshooting his original profittarget, he can no longer stand the pain of missing the rally and buysway above his planned entry point. The stock stalls and slides, and hewatches, first with hope and later frozen in horror, as it sinks like a rock.In the end, he can’t take any more pain and sells out at a loss—right nearthe bottom. What’s so rational about this process? The original plan to buymay have been rational, but implementing it created an emotional storm.\nEmotional traders do not pursue their best long-term interests. They\nare too busy savoring the adrenaline rush or too twisted in fear, des-10 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nperate to extract their fingers from a mousetrap. Prices reflect intelli-\ngent behavior of rational investors and traders, but they also reflectscreaming mass hysteria. The more active the market, the more tradersare emotional. Rational individuals can become a minority, surroundedby those with sweaty palms, pounding hearts, and clouded minds.\nMarkets are more efficient during flat trading ranges, when people\nare apt to use their heads. They grow less efficient during trends, whenpeople become more emotional. It is hard to make money in flat mar-kets because your opponents are relatively calm. Rational people makedangerous enemies. It is easier to take money from traders who areexcited by a fast-moving trend because emotional behavior is moreprimitive and easier to predict. To be a successful trader you must keepyour cool at all times and take money from aroused amateurs.\nPeople are more likely to be rational when alone, and grow more\nimpulsive when they join crowds. A trader’s intense focus on the priceof a stock, a currency, or a future pulls him into the crowd of all whotrade that vehicle. As the price ticks up and down, the eyes, the heads,and the bodies of traders across the continents start moving up anddown in unison. The market hypnotizes traders like a magician hyp-notizes a snake, by moving his flute rhythmically up and down. Thefaster the price moves, the stronger the emotions. The more emotionala market, the less efficient it is, and inefficiency creates profit oppor-tunities for calm, disciplined traders.\nA rational trader can make money by remaining calm and following\nhis rules. Around him, the crowd chases rallies, hard with greed. It sellsinto falling markets, squealing from pain and fear. All the while, theintelligent trader follows his rules. He may use a mechanical system oract as a discretionary trader, reading his markets and putting on trades.Either way, he follows his rules rather than his gut—that is his greatadvantage. A mature trader pulls money through the big hole in theefficient market theory, its presumption that investors and traders arerational human beings. Most people aren’t; only winners are.\nWhat Is Price?\nEach trade represents a transaction between a buyer and a sellerwho meet face to face, by phone or on the Internet, with or withoutbrokers. A buyer wants to buy as cheaply as possible. A seller wantsto sell as expensively as possible. Both feel pressure from the crowd ofINVEST? TRADE? GAMBLE? 11\nundecided traders that surrounds them, ready to jump in and snatch\naway their bargain.\nA trade takes place when the greediest buyer, afraid that prices will run\naway from him, steps up and bids a penny more. Or the most fearfulseller, afraid of getting stuck with his merchandise, agrees to accept apenny less. Sometimes a fearful seller dumps his merchandise on a calmand disciplined buyer waiting for a trade to come to him. All trades reflectthe behavior of the market crowd. Each price flashing on your screen rep-resents a momentary consensus of value among market participants.\nFundamental values of companies and commodities change slowly,\nbut prices swing all over the lot because the consensus can changequickly. One of my clients used to say that prices are connected to val-ues with a mile-long rubber band, allowing markets to swing betweenovervalued and undervalued levels.\nThe normal behavior of the crowd is to mill around, make noise, and\ngo nowhere. Once in a while a crowd becomes excited and explodesin a rally or a panic, but usually it just wastes time. Bits of news andrumors send ripples through the crowd, whose shifts leave footprints onour screens. Prices and indicators reflect changes in crowd psychology.\nWhen the market gives no clear signals to buy or sell short, many\nbeginners start squinting at their screens, trying to recognize tradingsignals. A good signal jumps at you from the chart and grabs you bythe face—you can’t miss it! It pays to wait for such signals instead offorcing trades when the market offers you none. Amateurs look forchallenges; professionals look for easy trades. Losers get high from theaction; the pros look for the best odds.\nFast-moving markets give the best trading signals. When crowds are\ngripped by emotions, cool traders find their best opportunities to makemoney. When markets go flat, many successful traders withdraw, leav-ing the field to gamblers and brokers. Jesse Livermore, a great specu-lator of the twentieth century, used to say that there is time to go long,time to go short, and time to go fishing.\nANINTELLIGENT GAMBLER ?\nMost people gamble at some point in their lives. For most it providesentertainment, for some it becomes an addiction, while a few become\npros and make a living at it. Gambling provides a living for a very\nsmall minority and entertainment for the masses, but a casual gambler12 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nreaching for a quick buck has the same chance of success as an ice\ncube on a hot stove.\nSome famous investors like betting on horses. They include Peter\nLynch, of Magellan Fund fame, and Warren Buffett, who used to pub-lish a newsletter on handicapping. My friend Lou, to whom my firstbook was dedicated, spent several years on the handicapping circuitand bet on horses for a living before buying an exchange seat and ap-proaching financial markets like a cool handicapper. Some card games,such as baccarat, are based on chance alone, whereas others, such asblackjack, involve a degree of skill that attracts intelligent people.\nProfessionals treat gambling as a job. They keep calculating odds\nand act only when mathematics point in their favor. Losers, on theother hand, itch for the action and enter one game after another,switching between half-baked systems.\nWhen you gamble for entertainment, follow a set of money man-\nagement rules. The first rule is to limit how much you’ll risk in anygiven session. On a rare occasion when a friend pulls me into a casino,I put what I am willing to lose that night into my right pocket, and stuffmy winnings, if any, into the left one. I stop playing as soon as myright pocket is empty, without ever reaching into the left. Once in awhile I find more money in the left pocket than I had in my right, butI certainly do not count on it.\nA friend who is a successful businessman enjoys the glitter of Las\nVegas. Several times a year he takes $5,000 in cash and flies there for aweekend. When his bankroll runs out, he goes for a swim in the pool,enjoys a good dinner, and flies back home. He can afford to spend$5,000 on entertainment and never blows more than his initial stake.Lounging at a pool after his cash is gone, he differs from legions ofcompulsive gamblers who keep charging more chips on their creditcards, waiting for their “luck” to turn. A gambler with no money man-agement is guaranteed to bust out.INVEST? TRADE? GAMBLE? 13\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nCHAPTER\nTWO\nWHAT MARKETS \nTO TRADE?\nMany people give little thought to life’s important decisions. They\nstumble into them by accidents of geography, time, or chance.\nWhere to live, where to work, what markets to trade—many of usdecide on a whim, without much serious thought. No wonder so manyare dissatisfied with their lives. You can choose your markets on awhim or pause to think whether to trade stocks, futures, or options.Each of those has pluses as well as minuses.\nSuccessful traders are rational people. Winners trade solely for the\nmoney, while losers get their kicks out of the excitement of the game.Where those kicks land is another question.\nIn choosing a market to trade, keep in mind that every trading\nvehicle, be it a stock, a future, or an option, has to meet two criteria:\nliquidity and volatility. Liquidity refers to the average daily volume,compared with that of other vehicles in its group. The higher thevolume, the easier it is to get in and out. You can build a profitableposition in a thin stock, only to get caught in the door at the exit andsuffer slippage trying to take profits. Volatility is the extent of move-ment in your vehicle. The more it moves, the greater the trading op-portunities. For example, stocks of many utility companies are veryliquid but hard to trade because of low volatility—they tend to stay innarrow price ranges. Some low-volume, low-volatility stocks may begood investments for your long-term portfolio, but not for trading.Remember that not all markets are good for trading simply becauseyou have a strong opinion on their future direction. They also musthave good volume and move well.\n15\nSTOCKS\nA stock is a certificate of company ownership. If you buy 100 shares\nof a company that issued 100 million shares, you own one-millionthof that firm. You become a part owner of that business, and if otherpeople want to own it, they will have to bid for your shares, liftingtheir value.\nWhen people like the prospects of a business, they bid for its shares,\npushing up prices. If they don’t like the outlook, they sell their stock,depressing prices. Public companies try to push up share pricesbecause it makes it easier for them to float more equity or sell debt.The bonuses of top executives are often tied to stock prices.\nFundamental values, especially earnings, drive prices in the long\nrun, but John Maynard Keynes, the famous economist and a cannystock picker, retorted “In the long run we’re all dead.” Markets are fullof cats and dogs, stocks of unprofitable companies that at some pointfly through the roof, defying gravity. Stocks of sexy new industries,such as biotechnology or the Internet, can fly on the expectations offuture earnings rather than on any real operating records. Each dog hasits day in the sun before reality sets in. Stocks of profitable, well-runcompanies may drift sideways to down. The market reflects the sumtotal of what every participant knows, thinks, or feels about a stock, anda declining price means large holders are selling. The essential rule inany market is “It’s OK to buy cheap, but not OK to buy down.” Don’t buya stock that’s trending lower, even if it looks like a bargain. If you likeits fundamentals, use technical analysis to confirm that the trend is up.\nWarren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in America, is\nfond of saying that when you buy a stock, you become a partner of amanic-depressive fellow he calls Mr. Market. Each day Mr. Market runsup and offers either to buy you out of business or to sell you his share.Most of the time you should ignore him because the man is psychotic,but occasionally Mr. Market becomes so terribly depressed that heoffers you his share for a song—and that’s when you should buy. Atother times he becomes so manic that he offers an insane price foryour share—and that’s when you should sell.\nThis idea is brilliant in its simplicity, but hard to implement. Mr.\nMarket sweeps most of us off our feet because his mood is so conta-gious. Most people want to sell when Mr. Market is depressed and buy16 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nwhen he is manic. We need to keep our sanity. We need objective cri-\nteria to decide how high is too high and how low is too low. Buffettmakes his decisions on the basis of fundamental analysis and a fantas-tic gut feel. Traders can use technical analysis.\nSpeaking of gut feel, this is something that an investor or a trader\nmay develop after years of successful experience. What beginners callgut feel is usually an urge to gamble, and I tell them they have no rightto a gut feel.\nWhat stocks should we trade? There are more than 10,000 of them\nin the United States, with even more abroad. Peter Lynch, a highly suc-cessful money manager, writes that he only buys stocks in companiesthat are so simple that an idiot could run them—because eventuallyone will. But Lynch is an investor, not a trader. Stocks of many com-panies with little fundamental value can embark on fantastic runs, mak-ing heaps of money for bullish traders before collapsing and makingjust as much money for the bears.\nThe stock market offers a wealth of choices, even after we cut out\nilliquid or flat stocks. You open a business newspaper, and stories offantastic rallies and breathtaking declines leap at you from the pages.Should you jump on the bandwagon and trade stocks in the news?Have they moved too far from the gate? How do you find future lead-ers? Having to make so many choices stresses beginners. They spreadthemselves thin, jumping between stocks instead of focusing on a fewand learning to trade them well. Newbies who cannot confidentlytrade a single stock go looking for scanning software that will let themtrack thousands.\nIn addition to stocks, you can choose from their kissing cousins,\nmutual funds, called unit trusts in Europe. Long-term investors tend\nto put money into diversified funds which hold hundreds of stocks.Traders tend to focus on sector funds that let them trade specific sec-tors of the economy or entire countries. You pick a favorite sector orcountry and leave individual stock selection to the supposedly hot-shotanalysts laboring at those funds.\nChoosing a winning stock or fund is a lot harder than listening to\ntips at a party or scanning headlines in a newspaper. A trader must de-velop a set of fundamental or technical search parameters, have thediscipline to follow his system, and spread a safety net of money man-agement under his account. We will delve into all three areas in Part 2.WHAT MARKETS TO TRADE? 17\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?How to Buy Stocks by Louis Engel is the best\nintroductory book for stock investors and traders. The author died yearsago, but the publisher updates the book every few years—be sure toget the latest edition.\nFUTURES\nFutures look dangerous at first—nine out of ten traders go bust in theirfirst year. As you look closer, it becomes clear that the danger is not infutures but in the people who trade them. Futures offer traders someof the best profit opportunities, but the dangers are commensurate withrewards. Futures make it easy for gamblers to shoot themselves in thefoot, or higher. A trader with good money management skills needn’tfear futures.\nFutures used to be called commodities , the irreducible building blocks\nof the economy. Old-timers used to say that a commodity was some-thing that hurt when you dropped it on your foot—gold, sugar, wheat,crude oil. In recent decades many financial instruments began totrade like commodities—currencies, bonds, stock indexes. The termfutures includes traditional commodities along with new financial\ninstruments.\nA future is a contract to deliver or accept delivery of a specific quan-\ntity of a commodity by a certain date. A futures contract is binding onboth buyer and seller. In options the buyer has the right but not anobligation to take delivery. If you buy a call or a put, you can walkaway if you like. In futures, you have no such luxury. If the marketgoes against you, you have to add money to your margin or get out ofyour trade at a loss. Futures are stricter than options but are priced bet-ter for traders.\nBuying a stock makes you a part owner of a company. When you\nbuy a futures contract you don’t own anything, but enter into a bind-ing contract for a future purchase of merchandise, be it a carload ofwheat or a sheaf of Treasury bonds. The person who sells you thatcontract assumes the obligation to deliver. The money you pay for astock goes to the seller, but in futures your margin money stays withthe broker as a security, ensuring you’ll accept delivery when yourcontract comes due. They used to call margin money honest money .\nWhile in stocks you pay interest for margin borrowing, in futures youcan collect interest on your margin.18 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nEach futures contract has a settlement date, with different dates sell-\ning for different prices. Some professionals analyze their differences topredict reversals. Most futures traders do not wait and close out theircontracts early, settling profits and losses in cash. Still, the existence ofa delivery date forces people to act, providing a useful reality check. Aperson may sit on a losing stock for ten years, deluding himself it isonly a paper loss. In futures, reality, in the form of the settlement date,always intrudes on a daydreamer.\nTo understand how futures work, let’s compare a futures trade with\na cash trade—buying or selling a quantity of a commodity outright.Let’s say it’s February and gold is trading at $400 an ounce. Your analy-sis indicates it is likely to rise to $420 within weeks. With $40,000 youcan buy a 100-ounce gold bar from a dealer. If your analysis is correct,in a few weeks your gold will be worth $42,000. You can sell it andmake a $2,000 profit, or 5 percent before commissions—nice. Now let’ssee what happens if you trade futures based on the same analysis.\nSince it is February, April is the next delivery month for gold. One\nfutures contract covers 100 oz. of gold, with a value of $40,000. Themargin on this contract is only $1,000. In other words, you can control$40,000 worth of gold with a $1,000 deposit. If your analysis is correctand gold rallies $20 per oz., you’ll make roughly the same profit as youwould have made had you bought 100 oz. of gold for cash—$2,000.Only now your profit is not 5% but 200%, since your margin was$1,000. Futures can really boost your gains!\nMost people, once they understand how futures work, are flooded\nwith greed. An amateur with $40,000 calls his broker and tells him tobuy 40 contracts! If his analysis is correct and gold rallies to $420, he’llmake $2,000 per contract, or $80,000. He’ll triple his money in a fewweeks! If he repeats this just a few times, he’ll be a millionaire beforethe end of the year! Such dreams of easy money ruin gamblers. What,if anything, do they overlook?\nThe trouble with markets is that they don’t move in straight lines.\nCharts are full of false breakouts, false reversals, and flat trading ranges.Gold may well rise from $400/oz. to $420/oz., but it is perfectly capa-ble of dipping to $390 along the way. That $10 dip would have cre-ated a $1,000 paper loss for someone who bought 100 oz. of gold forcash. For a futures trader who holds a 100 oz. contract on a $1,000 mar-gin that $10 decline represents a total wipeout. Long before he reachesthat sad point, his broker will call and ask for more margin money. IfWHAT MARKETS TO TRADE? 19\n20 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nyou have committed most of your equity to a trade, you’ll have no\nreserves and your broker will sell you out.\nGamblers dream of fat profits, margin themselves to the hilt, and get\nkicked out of the game by the first wiggle that goes against them. Theirlong-term analysis may be right and gold may rise to its target price,but the beginner is doomed because he commits too much of hisequity and has very thin reserves. Futures do not kill traders—poormoney management kills traders.\nFutures can be very attractive for those who have strong money\nmanagement skills. They promise high rates of return but demand ice-cold discipline. When you first approach trading, you are better offwith slower-moving stocks. Once you have matured as a trader, take alook at futures. They may be right for you if you’re very disciplined.We return to the futures markets in Part 2 and look at the best ones forgetting started.\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?Winning in the Futures Markets by George\nAngell is the best introductory book for futures traders. (It is highly supe-rior to all his other books.) The Futures Game by Teweles and Jones is\na mini-encyclopedia that has educated generations of futures traders (besure to get the latest edition). Economics of Futures Trading by Thomas\nA. Hieronymus is probably the most profound book on futures, but it’slong been out of print—try finding a used copy.\nOPTIONS\nAn option is a bet that a specific stock, index, or future will reach orexceed a specific price within a specific time. Please stop and rereadthat sentence. Notice that the word specific occurs in it three times. You\nmust choose the right stock, predict the extent of its move, and fore-cast how fast it’ll get there. You must make three choices—if you’rewrong on just one, you’ll lose money.\nWhen you buy an option, you have to jump through three hoops in\na single leap. You have to be right on the stock or the future, right onits move, and right on its timing. Ever tried tossing a ball through threerings at an amusement park? This triple complexity makes buying op-tions a deadly game.\nOptions offer leverage—an ability to control large positions with a\nsmall outlay of cash. The entire risk of an option is limited to the price\nWHAT MARKETS TO TRADE? 21\nyou pay for it. Options allow traders to make money fast when they’re\nright, but if the market reverses, you can walk away and owe nothing!This is the standard flow of brokerage house propaganda. It attractshordes of small traders who cannot afford to buy stocks but want abigger bang for their buck. What usually gets banged is the optionbuyer’s head.\nMy company, Financial Trading, Inc., has been selling books to\ntraders for years. Whenever a person comes back to buy another book,it is a sign that he is active in the markets. Many clients buy bookson stocks or futures every few months or years. But when a first-timebuyer orders a book on options, he never returns. Why? Does he makeso much money so fast that he doesn’t need another book? Or does hewash out?\nMany beginners buy calls because they can’t afford stocks. Futures\ntraders who get beat up sometimes turn to options on futures. Losersswitch to options instead of dealing with their own inability to trade.Using a shortcut to weasel out of trouble instead of facing a problemnever works.\nSuccessful stock and futures traders sometimes use options to\nreduce risks or protect profits. Serious traders buy options rarely andonly in special situations, as we will see later in this book. Options arehopeless for poor people who use them as substitutes for stocksbecause they can’t afford the real thing.\nProfessionals take full advantage of starry-eyed beginners crowding\ninto options. Their bid-ask spreads are terrible. If an option is bid 75cents, offered at a dollar, you are 25% behind the game as soon as youbuy. The expression “your loss is limited to what you paid for an option”means you can lose 100%! What’s so great about losing everything?\nA client of mine was a market-maker on the floor of the American\nStock Exchange. She came to my classes on technical analysis becauseshe was pregnant and wanted to get off the floor and trade from home.“Options,” she said, “are a hope business. You can buy hope or sell hope.I am a professional—I sell hope. I come to the floor in the morning andfind what the public wants. Then I price that hope and sell it to them.”\nProfessionals are more likely to write options than buy them. Writing\nis a capital-intensive business. You need hundreds of thousands ofdollars to do it right, and most successful options writers operate withmillions. And even theirs is not a risk-free game. Several years ago afriend who used to be one of the nation’s top money managers landed\non the front page of The Wall Street Journal after he lost 20 years’\nworth of profits in a single bad day of writing naked puts.\nThere are two types of option writers. Covered writers buy a stock\nand write an option against it. Naked writers write calls and puts onstocks they don’t own, backing their writes with cash in their accounts.Writing naked options feels like taking money out of thin air, but a vio-lent move can put you out of business. Writing options is a seriousgame, suitable only for disciplined and well-capitalized traders.\nMarkets are like pumps that suck money out of the pockets of the\npoorly informed majority and pump it into the pockets of a savvyminority. People who service those pumps, such as brokers, vendors,regulators, and even janitors who sweep exchange floors, are paidfrom the stream of money flowing through the markets. Since marketstake money from the majority, pay help, and give what’s left to thesavvy minority, the majority, by definition, must lose. You can be surethat whatever the majority of traders does, believes, and says, is notworth doing, believing, and saying. You have to stand apart from thecrowd in order to succeed. Smart traders look for situations where alarge majority does something one way, while a small, moneyedminority goes the opposite way.\nIn options the majority buys calls and, to a lesser degree, puts. The\ninsiders almost exclusively write options. Professionals use their heads,while amateurs are driven by greed and fear. Options take full advan-tage of those feelings.\nGreed is the engine of option-selling propaganda. You must have\nheard the slogan: “Control a large block of stock with just a few dol-lars!” An amateur may be bullish on a $60 stock, but doesn’t have$6,000 to buy 100 shares. He buys some $70 calls with two months oflife left in them for $500 each. If that stock rises to 75, those optionswill acquire $500 of intrinsic value, while maintaining some time value,and a speculator can double his stake in a month! The amateur buyscalls and sits back to watch his money double.\nStrange things begin to happen. Whenever the stock rises two points,\nhis calls go up only one, but when the stock falls or even pauses, hiscalls fall briskly. Instead of seeing his money double in a hurry, theamateur is soon staring at a 50% paper loss, while the clock starts tick-ing louder and louder. The expiration date is nearing, and even thoughthe stock is higher than it was when he bought his calls, they are nowcheaper, showing a paper loss. Should he sell and salvage some money22 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nor hold and wait for a rally? Even if he knows the right thing to do,\nhe’s not going to do it. His greed does him in. He hangs on until hisoptions expire worthless.\nAnother great motivator for buying options is fear, especially in\noptions on futures. A loser takes a few painful hits—his analysis waswet and money management nonexistent. He sees an attractive tradebut fears losing. He hears the siren song—“unlimited gains with lim-ited risk”—and buys options on futures. Speculators buy options likepoor people buy lottery tickets. A person who buys a lottery ticketrisks 100% of what he paid. Any situation where you risk 100% lookslike an odd case of limited risk. Limited to 100%!?! Most speculatorsignore this ominous figure.\nOption buyers have a dismal track record. They may make a few\ndollars on a few trades, but I’ve never seen anyone build equity buy-ing options. The odds in this game are so bad that after a few tradesthey are sure to kick in and destroy a buyer. At the same time, optionshave a high entertainment value. They provide a cheap ticket to thegame, an inexpensive dream, just like a lottery ticket.\nYou need a minimum of one year of successful trading experience in\nstocks or futures before touching options. If you are new to the markets,do not even dream of using options in lieu of stocks. No matter howsmall your account, find some stocks and learn to trade them.\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?The all-time bestseller on options, and\ndeservedly so, is Lawrence MacMillan’s Options as a Strategic Invest-\nment. It is a veritable mini-encyclopedia that covers all aspects of\noptions trading, better than his other book.WHAT MARKETS TO TRADE? 23\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nCHAPTER\nTHREE\nTHE FIRST STEPS\nTrading lures us with its promise of freedom. If you know how to\ntrade, you can live and work anyw here in the w orld, be indepen-\ndent from the routine, and not answer to anybody. Trading attractspeople of above-average intelligence who enjoy games and aren’tafraid of risks. Before you rush into this exciting venture, keep in mindthat in addition to your enthusiasm you will need to bring a soberunderstanding of the realities of trading.\nTrading will stress your feelings. To survive and succeed, you will\nneed to develop a sound trading psychology.\nTrading will challenge your mind. To gain an edge in the markets,\nyou will need to master good analytic methods.\nTrading will demand good mathematical skills. A math illiterate who\ncan’t manage risks is guaranteed to bust out.\nTrading psychology, technical analysis, money management—if you\nlearn all three, you can make it in trading. But first, let us look at theexternal obstacles to your success.\nThe markets are set up to separate the maximum number of peo-\nple from their money. Stealing is not permitted, but markets areheavily slanted in favor of insiders and against outsiders. Let us explorethe barriers that prevent many traders from succeeding and try tolower them.\nTHEEXTERNAL BARRIERS TO SUCCESS\nAn investor can start with practically nothing, buying a few thousanddollars worth of shares. If he buys and holds, his commissions andother expenses will be minor factors in his success or failure. Traders\n25\nhave a harder task. Seemingly trivial expenses can break them, and the\nsmaller the account, the greater the danger. Transaction costs can raisean impassable barrier to winning.\nTransaction costs?!Beginners hardly think of them, yet transaction costs are a leading\ncause of trader mortality. Adjusting your plans to reduce those costsgives you an advantage over the market crowd.\nI have a friend whose 12-year-old daughter recently came up with a\nbrilliant idea for a new business, which she called The Guinea PigFactory. She ran off promotional flyers on her mom’s copy machineand stuffed them into neighbors’ mailboxes. Guinea pigs, popularamong kids in her neighborhood, cost $6, but she could buy themat the central market for only $4. The girl dreamed of profits whenher mother, who is a trader, asked how she was going to get fromthe Sydney suburb where they lived to the central market and back.Someone will give me a ride, answered the girl.\nA child may get a free ride, but the market will not give it to you. If\nyou buy a stock at $4 and sell it at $6, you won’t make a $2 profit. Abig chunk of it will go for transaction costs. Amateurs tend to ignorethem, while professionals focus on them and do everything in theirpower to reduce them—unless they’re collecting them from you, inwhich case they try to blow them up. Beginners get into their GuineaPig Factories and cannot understand why they keep buying at 4, sell-ing at 6, and are still losing money.\nA new trader is like a little lamb walking into a dark forest. He is\nlikely to be killed, and his skin—his trading capital—divided threeways, between brokers, professional traders, and service providers.Each will try to grab a piece of that poor lamb’s skin. Don’t be thatlamb—think of transaction costs. There are three kinds of them: com-missions, slippage, and expenses.\nCommissions\nCommissions may appear to be a minuscule expense. Most tradersneglect them, but if you add them up, you’re likely to find that yourbroker ends up with much of your profit.\nA brokerage firm may charge about $20 to buy or sell up to 5,000\nshares. If you have a $20,000 account and buy 200 shares of a $100stock, the commission of $20 comes to one-tenth of one percent. When26 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nyou sell those shares and pay another commission, the cost of broker-\nage rises to approximately two-tenths of one percent of your equity.Trade like that once a week, and at the end of the month your brokerwill have earned one percent of your account, regardless of whether youmade money. Keep going like that for a year, and your commission costwill rise to 12% of your equity. That’s a lot of money. Professional moneymanagers are happy with 25% annual returns, year after year. They couldnot generate them if they had to pay 12% annually in commissions.\nBut wait, it gets worse.Look at a small trader who can afford only 100 shares of a $20 stock.\nHis purchase price is $2,000, but he pays the same $20 commission, whicheats up a whopping 1 percent of his equity. When he closes that trade andpays another commission, he is 2 percent behind the game. If he tradeslike that once a week, by the end of the month his commissions willcome to 10% of his account, more than 100% on annualized basis. Thegreat George Soros averages 29% annual gain. He could have neveraccomplished that if he had to jump over a 100% commission barrier.\nThe bigger your account, the smaller the percentage eaten by com-\nmissions and the lower your barrier to winning. Having a large accountis a great advantage, but whatever your size, do not be hyperactive.Each trade and each seemingly cheap commission raise the barrier toyour success. Design a system that doesn’t trade very often.\nI’ve met futures traders who paid $80 roundtrip commissions to full-\nservice brokers. That was the price of allegedly sage advice, but any dis-interested professional will tell you that a futures trader who pays $80roundtrip has no chance of winning. Why do people pay such exorbi-tant rates? Because the little lamb who ventures into a dark forest is soafraid of the big bad wolf, the professional trader, that he hires himselfa protector to guide him, a full-service broker. Once you do the math,it becomes clear that you’re better off taking your chances on the wolfthan signing up for a guaranteed skinning by your protector.\nThere are full-service brokers whose advice is worth the money.\nThey bring good tips, get good fills, and their commissions are notexorbitant. The catch is that they only accept very large accounts thatgenerate a high volume of business. Bring them a million-dollar accountwith a history of active trading, and you may get their attention.\nIf you have an account in five or six figures and trade only a cou-\nple of times a week, do not waste your time and money looking forfalse security of an expensive broker. Get a cheap, reliable, no-frillsTHE FIRST STEPS 27\nbroker that you can easily reach via the Internet or on the phone—and\nstart looking for good trades.\nSlippage\nSlippage is the difference between the price at the time you placedyour order and the price at which that order got filled. You may placean order to buy when a guinea pig is trading at $4, but your bill comesto $4.25. How come? Then the guinea pig goes up to $6 and you placean order to sell at the market, only to receive $5.75. Why? In our dailylives we are used to paying posted prices. Here, at the grown-upGuinea Pig Factory, they clip you for a quarter buying and another sell-ing. It could get worse. Those quarters and halves can add up to asmall fortune for a moderately active trader. Who gets that money?Slippage is one of the key sources of income for market professionals,which is why they tend to be very hush-hush about it.\nNo stock, future, or option has a set price, but it does have two rap-\nidly changing prices—a bid and an ask. A bid is what a buyer is offer-ing to pay, whereas an ask is what a seller is asking. A professional ishappy to accommodate an eager buyer, selling to him instantly, on thespot—at a price slightly higher than the latest trade in that market. Agreedy trader who’s afraid that the bullish train is leaving the stationoverpays a pro who lets him have his stock right away. That pro offersa similar service to sellers. If you want to sell without waiting, afraidthat prices may collapse, a professional will buy from you on thespot—at a price slightly lower than the latest trade in that market.Anxious sellers accept ridiculously low prices. Slippage depends on theemotional state of market participants.\nThe professional who sells to buyers and buys from sellers is not a\nsocial worker. He is running a business, not a charitable operation.Slippage is the price he charges for rapid action. He has paid a highprice for his spot at the crossroads of buy and sell orders, buying orleasing an exchange seat or installing expensive equipment.\nSome orders are slippage-proof, while others invite slippage. The\nthree most popular types of orders are limit, market, and stop. A limitorder specifies the price; that is, “Buy 100 shares of Guinea Pig Factoryat $4.” If the market is quiet and you’re willing to wait, you’ll get thatprice. If GPF dips below $4 by the time your order hits the market, youmay get it a little cheaper, but don’t count on it. If the market rises28 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nabove $4, your limit order will not be filled. A limit order lets you con-\ntrol the price at which you buy or sell, but doesn’t guarantee you a fill.\nA market order lets you buy or sell immediately, at whatever price\nyou can get at the moment. The execution is guaranteed, but not theprice. If you want to buy or sell right away, this very moment, you can-not expect to get the best price—you give up control and suffer slip-page. Market orders placed by anxious traders are the bread and butterof the pros.\nA stop order becomes a market order when the market touches that\nlevel. Suppose you buy 100 shares of Guinea Pig Factory at $4.25,expect it to rise to $7, but protect your position with a stop at $3.75.If the price slides to $3.75, your stop becomes a market order, executedas soon as possible. You’ll get out, but expect to suffer slippage in afast-moving market.\nYou can choose what you want to control when you place an\norder—the price or the time. A limit order lets you control the price,with no assurance of a fill. When you place a market order, a fill isassured, but not the price. A calm and patient trader prefers to use limitorders, since those who use market orders keep losing slivers of capi-tal in slippage.\nSlippage tends to be a much bigger expense than commissions. I esti-\nmated the size of both in Trading for a Living and thought this was one\nof the most explosive parts of the book, but very few noticed. People inthe grip of greed or fear want to trade at any price, rather than focus ontheir long-term financial interests. So much for the efficient market theory.\nThere are day-trading firms promising to teach traders to take advan-\ntage of slippage by trading inside the bid-ask spreads. Their technol-ogy does not guarantee success, while commissions from active tradingnegate any advantage. People pay a lot of money for Level 2 quotes,but I haven’t noticed any great increase in performance among thosewho use them.\nGetting into a trade is like jumping into a fast-moving river. The\nopportunity as well as the danger is in the water. You are safe stand-ing on the bank and can control where and when to jump, but gettingout of the water can be more tricky. You may see a spot where youwant to get out—a profit target, where you can place a limit order.You may want to let the river carry you as long as the current allows,protecting your position with a trailing stop. That may increase yourprofits, but it also will increase slippage.THE FIRST STEPS 29\nLimit orders work best for entering trades. You’ll miss a trade once\nin a while, but there will be many others. That river has been flowingfor hundreds of years. A serious trader uses limit orders to get in andto take profits, and protects his positions with stops. Anything we cando to reduce slippage goes directly to our bottom line and improvesour odds of long-term success.\nExpenses\nSome expenses are unavoidable, especially in the beginning—you’ll haveto buy a few books, download trading software, sign up with a data serv-ice, and so on. It is important to keep your expenses as low as possible.Amateurs have a charming habit of paying for their trading-relatedexpenses, such as computers, subscriptions, and advisory services, withcredit cards, without taking money out of their trading accounts. Thatprotects them from seeing the true rate at which they are going downhill.\nGood traders add to profitable positions and reduce the size of their\ntrades during losing streaks. We can apply the same sound principleto expenditures. Losers like to throw money at problems, while winnersinvest a fraction of their profits in their operations. Successful traderstreat themselves to a new computer or software package only afterthey have enough profit to pay for it.\nEven the best tools can blow you out of the water. At a recent sem-\ninar in Frankfurt, a trader was excited about a powerful analytic pack-age for which he was going to sign up the following week. It cost 2,000marks a month (almost $1,000), but it was going to give him a tremen-dous analytic advantage. “How much money do you have in yourtrading account?” I asked. 50,000 marks. “Then you can’t afford it. Thissoftware will cost you 24,000 marks a year, and you’ll have to gener-ate almost 50% profit simply to pay for your signals. No matter howgood the software, at this rate you’ll lose money. Look for a cheaperpackage, something that’ll cost no more than 1,000 marks per year, orabout 2% of your account.”\nInstitutional traders get support from their managers, peers, and staff,\nbut private traders tend to feel lonely and isolated. Vendors prey on themby promising to help lead them out of the wilderness. The more over-loaded you feel, the more likely you are to listen to vendors. Nine outof ten professionals in any field, be they lawyers, auto mechanics, ordoctors, are not good enough. You don’t trust an average auto mechanic30 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nor a doctor, but rather ask for referrals from friends you respect. Most\nprivate traders do not know who to ask and respond to advisors withthe loudest advertisements, who are rarely the best trading experts.\nAn advisor I’ve known for years was recently indicted by the Feds\nfor stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from Japanese clients. Priorto that, he cultivated a reputation as one of the most prominent mar-ket experts in the United States, constantly quoted by the media. Wewere introduced at a conference, where people paid thousands of dol-lars to listen to him. He asked me what I thought of his presentation,and I said it sounded amazingly interesting but I could not understandmuch of it. “That’s the point,” he beamed. “If my clients believe I knowsomething they don’t, I’ve got them for life!” I knew right away theman was dishonest, and was surprised only by the size of his loot.\nSome trading advice can be amazingly good. A few dollars will buy you\na book that holds the experience of a lifetime. A few hundred dollars willget you a subscription to a newsletter with original and helpful advice. Butgems are few and far between, while legions of hucksters prey on inse-cure traders. I have two rules for filtering out the worst offenders: avoidservices you don’t understand and avoid expensive services.\nIf you don’t understand an advisor, stay away from him. Trading\nattracts people of above-average intelligence, which probably appliesto you. If you cannot understand something after an honest effort, it’sprobably because the other guy is giving you double-talk. When itcomes to books, I avoid those written in bad English. Language is areflection of thought, and if a guy cannot write clearly, his thinkingprobably isn’t too clear either. I also avoid books with no bibliography.We all borrow from our predecessors, and an author who doesn’tacknowledge his debts is either arrogant, lazy, or both. Those are terri-ble traits in a trader, and if he writes like that, I don’t want his advice.And of course, I have zero respect for thieves. Book titles are not copy-righted, and in recent years a bunch of people have lifted the title ofmy first book, Trading for a Living , usually with slight variations. I am\nsure that some clown will steal the title of the book you’re now read-ing. Will you want to learn from a poacher who cannot think for himself?\nMy second rule is to avoid very expensive services, be they books,\nadvisory letters, or seminars. A $200 newsletter is likely to be a bettervalue than a $2,000 one, and a $500 seminar a better value than a$5,000 one. Merchants of super-expensive products sell an implicitpromise of “the keys to the kingdom.” Their customers are usuallyTHE FIRST STEPS 31\ndesperate to dig out from under abysmal losses. Football players call\nthis a “Hail Mary” play—when a losing team in the last seconds of thegame desperately tosses the ball forward, hoping to score. They’vealready lost the game on skill, and now try to come back in a singledesperate gamble. When a trader who lost more than half of hisaccount buys a $3,000 trading system, he is doing the same thing.\nHelpful advisors tend to be modest, and price their services accord-\ningly. An obscene price is a marketing gimmick that conveys a sub-liminal message that the service is magic. There is no magic—no onecan deliver on that promise. A relatively inexpensive service is a bar-gain when it’s good, and a cheap loss when it isn’t.\nSomeone once asked Sigmund Freud what he thought the best attitude\nfor a patient was. “Benign skepticism,” answered the great psychiatrist,and that’s good advice for financial traders. Maintain an attitude of healthyskepticism. If you find something you don’t understand, try it again, andif you still do not get it, it is probably not worth having. Run, do not walk,from those who offer to sell you the keys to the kingdom. Keep yourexpenses low and remember, any information you receive becomes valu-able to you only after you’ve tested it on your data, making it your own.\nGETTING YOURGEAR\nA successful trader is like a fish swimming upstream, against thecurrent. Commissions, slippage, and expenses keep pushing you back.You must make enough money to overshoot these three barriers beforemaking a dime.\nThere is no shame in deciding trading is too hard and walking away,\njust as there is no shame in being unable to dance or play the piano.Many beginners jump in without thinking and get financially and emo-tionally hurt. It is a great game, but if you leave, better do it early.\nIf you decide to trade, read on, because in the following sections we\nwill look into psychology, trading tactics, and money management. Butfirst, we must talk about the practical aspects of trading—how to openan account, choose a computer, and start collecting data.\nSize Matters\nMaking or losing money in the market depends in part on how muchyou put into your account. Two people can take identical trades, but one32 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nwill grow equity, while the other will bust out. How could this be if they\nbuy and sell the same quantity of the same stock at the same time?\nSuppose we meet and decide to pass an hour tossing a coin, playing\nheads-or-tails—heads you win, tails you lose. Each of us will bring $5to the game and bet 25 cents on each flip. As long as we use a fair coin,by the end of the hour we will be about even, each with about $5.\nWhat happens if we play the same game and use the same coin,\nonly now you start with $5, while I bring only $1? You’ll probably endup taking my money. You are likely to win because your capital pro-vides greater staying power. It would take a string of 20 losses to bank-rupt you, while for me a string of just 4 losses would be fatal. Fourlosses in a row are much more likely than 20. The trouble with a smallaccount is that it has no reserves to survive even a short run of losingtrades. Winning trades are always interlaced with losers, and a shortlosing streak wipes out small traders.\nMost beginners start out with too little money. There is plenty of\nnoise in the markets—random moves that defy trading systems. A smalltrader who runs into a noisy period has no safety cushion. His long-term analysis may be brilliant, but the market will do him in, becausehe does not have the staying power to ride out a losing streak.\nBack in 1980, as a greenhorn amateur, I walked into a Chase bank\naround the corner and drew a $5,000 cash advance against my creditcard. I needed that princely sum to meet a margin call in my depletedtrading account. A beady-eyed cashier called the manager, whodemanded my thumbprint on the receipt. The transaction felt dirty, butI got the money—which I proceeded to lose within a few months. Mysystem was correct, but the market noise was killing me. It wasn’t untilI got my trading account into a comfortable high five figures that Istarted making money. I wish someone had explained the concept ofsize to me in those days.\nTrading a small account is like flying an airplane at treetop level.\nYou have no room to maneuver, no time to think. The slightest slip ofattention, a piece of bad luck, a freaky branch sticking out into theair—you crash and burn. The higher you fly, the more time you haveto find your way out of trouble. Flying at a low altitude is toughenough for experts, but deadly for beginners. A trader needs to gainaltitude, get more equity, and buy some space for maneuvers.\nA person with a large account who bets a small fraction on any\ngiven trade can stay calm. A person with a small account grows tenseTHE FIRST STEPS 33\nknowing that any single trade can either boost or damage his account.\nAs the stress rises, the capacity to reason goes down.\nI saw the best example of how money can twist a player’s mind\nwhile teaching my oldest daughter to play backgammon. She was abouteight at the time but very determined and bright. After a few months ofpractice she began beating me. Then I suggested we play for money—a penny a point, which in our scoring meant a maximum of 32 centsper game. She kept beating me, and I kept raising the stakes. By thetime we reached 10 cents a point she started losing and soon gave backevery last penny. Why could she beat me playing for little or no moneybut lost when the stakes increased? Because for me $3.20 was pocketchange, but for the kid it was real money. Thinking about it made hera little more tense and she played slightly below her peak level—enough to fall behind. A trader with a small account is so preoccupiedwith money that it impairs his ability to think, play, and win.\nOther beginners bring too much money to the game, and that is not\ngood either. A beginner with too much capital goes chasing after toomany rabbits, becomes careless, loses track of his positions, and endsup losing money.\nHow much should you have in your trading account when you start?\nRemember, we are talking about trading capital. It doesn’t include yoursavings, long-term investments, retirement funds, house equity, orChristmas club. We only count the money that you want to spin in themarkets, aiming to achieve a higher rate of return than you can getfrom Treasury bills.\nDo not even dream of starting with less than $20,000. That is the\nbarest minimum, but $50,000 provides a much safer flying altitude. Itallows you to diversify and practice sensible money management. Atthe same time, I do not suggest starting with more than $100,000. Toomuch money in a trading account makes a beginner lose focus andleads to sloppy trading. Professionals can use a lot more, but begin-ners should stay below $100,000 while learning to trade. Learn to fly asingle-engine plane before moving up to a twin-engine model. A suc-cessful trader needs to get into the habit of being careful with money.\nBeginners sometimes ask me what to do if they have only $10,000\nor $5,000. I urge them to study the markets and paper-trade, while get-ting a second job to accumulate capital. Start trading with a decent-sized account. You’re going into battle, your capital is your sword, and34 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nyou need a weapon that’s long enough to give you a chance in com-\nbat with well-armed opponents.\nHardware and Software\nThinking about my first purchases of trading technology is pure nos-talgia. I walked into a drugstore in Florida and bought a pocket calcu-lator. A year later I acquired a programmable calculator with a tiny engine\nthat pulled magnetic memory cards through its slot. Then I bought myfirst computer. It had two floppy drives—one for the program, theother for the data diskette. I upgraded it from 48K to 64K RAM (that’skilobytes, not megabytes!), and it was a rocket. My first modem col-lected data at a brisk 300 baud, later upgraded to a sizzling 1,200.When hard drives became available, I bought myself a 10-MB unit(they also had a 20-MB model, but who needed such a monster?).There was only one good program for technical analysis, and it cost$1,900. Today, I can buy a hundred times more powerful software fora tenth of that price.\nDoes every trader need a computer? My friend Lou Taylor did all his\nresearch on scraps of paper. I used to offer him computers, but to noavail. Most traders, including myself, would be lost without a computer.It expands our reach and speeds up research. Just keep in mind thatcomputers do not guarantee profits. Technology helps, but does notguarantee victory. A poor driver will crash the best car.\nTo become a computerized trader, you must choose a computer,\ntrading software, and a source of data. Trading programs tend to beundemanding and run well on older, slower machines. A good pro-gram for technical analysis must download the data, plot daily, weekly,and possibly intraday charts, and offer a multitude of indicators. Agood program should allow you to add your own indicators to the sys-tem and let you scan lists of securities according to your parameters.The list of programs for traders keeps growing, so that by the time youread this book any review will be out of date. My company keepsupdating our brief software guide, which we send out as a public ser-vice. To request a current copy, please contact us at the address thatappears in the back of this book.\nA striking development in recent years is the wealth of resources for\ntraders available on the Internet. Today you can analyze markets with-THE FIRST STEPS 35\nout buying any software—just go to a website, key in your stocks or\nfutures, select the indicators, and click your mouse. Some websites arefree, while others are subscription-based. With all those websites, whybuy technical analysis software? For the same reason that in a city likeNew York, with its good public transportation system, some of us owncars. Clients often ask me how to add some new indicator to theirfavorite website. When you travel by bus, you cannot ask the driver totake your favorite route.\nCan you program your own indicator into a website and scan charts\nwith it, posting green dots for buy signals and red dots for sell signals?When you find a website that can do it, you may no longer need soft-ware. Until that time, those of us who are serious about research willcontinue to buy technical analysis software. You can get a top-notchprogram for a few hundred dollars. A historical database with a year’sworth of updates will cost a couple of hundred more. If you have atiny account, however, use free websites. Always try to push yourexpenses down to the smallest possible percentage of your account.\nData\nSigning up with a data service appears simple, but raises several ques-tions that go to the heart of trading. How many markets should youfollow? How far back should you go in your research? Do you needreal-time data? Answering these questions takes you deep into the trad-ing enterprise and forces you to review your decision-making process.\nHow Many Markets Should You Follow? Beginners make the com-\nmon mistake of trying to follow too many markets at once. Some lookfor software to scan thousands of stocks and quickly bog down.Serious beginners should pick no more than two or three dozen stocksand track them day in and day out. You need to get to know them,develop a feel for how they move. Do you know when your compa-nies release their earnings? Do you know their highest and lowestprices for the past year? The more you know about a stock, the moreconfidence you have and the fewer surprises can jump out at you.Many professionals focus on just a few stocks, or even on a single one.\nWhich stocks should you track? Begin by choosing two or three cur-\nrently hot industries. Technology, Internet, telecommunications, andbiotechnology industries are in the forefront of the market at the time36 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nof this writing, but the list is likely to change. It always does. Pick half\na dozen leading stocks in each of those industries and follow themdaily. That’s where you’ll find the highest volumes, the steadiest trends,the crispest reversals. Several months later, after you get to know yourstocks and make some money, you may be ready to add anotherindustry group and pick its top six stocks. Remember, the depth ofyour research is much more important than its breadth. You can makemore money from a handful of familiar stocks.\nThe choice is easier for futures traders—there are only about three\ndozen futures, in six or seven groups. Beginners should stay away fromthe most volatile markets. Take grains, for instance. You should analyzecorn, wheat, and soybeans, but trade only corn because it tends to bethe slowest and quietest of the group. Learn to ride a bicycle with train-ing wheels before starting to race. When it comes to tropicals, analyzeall, but trade only sugar—a big, liquid, and reasonably volatile market,leaving aside coffee and cocoa, which can move as fast as the S&P.Needless to say, a beginner has no business with stock index futures,whose nickname on the floor is “rockets.” You may graduate to them ina couple of years, but at this stage, if you have an opinion on the stockmarket, trade SPDRs or QQQs, exchange-traded market indexes.\nHow Far Back Should You Go in Your Research? A daily chart on a\ncomputer screen will comfortably show five or six months of history.You’ll see less with candlesticks (see p. 72), which take up more space.Daily charts alone aren’t enough, and you need weekly charts with atleast two years worth of history. Learning history prepares you for thefuture, and it could be helpful to glance at a 10-year chart and seewhether that market is high or low in the long-term scheme of things.\nCharts spanning 20 or more years are especially useful for futures\ntraders. Futures, unlike stocks, have natural floors and ceilings. Thoselevels are not rigid, but before you buy or sell, try to find out whetheryou’re closer to the floor or the ceiling.\nThe floor price of futures is their cost of production. When a market\nfalls below that level, producers start quitting, supply falls, and pricesrise. If there is a glut of sugar and its price on the world markets fallsbelow what it costs to grow the stuff, major producers are going to startshutting down their operations. There are exceptions, such as when adesperately poor country sells commodities on the world markets toearn hard currency, while paying domestic workers with devaluedTHE FIRST STEPS 37\nlocal money. The price can dip below the cost of production, but it\ncannot stay there for long.\nThe ceiling for most commodities is the cost of substitution. One\ncommodity can replace another if the price is right. For example, witha rise in the price of corn, a major animal feed, it may be cheaper tofeed animals wheat. As more farmers switch and reduce corn pur-chases, they take away the fuel that raised corn prices. A market in thegrip of hysteria may briefly rise above its ceiling, but cannot stay therefor long. Its return to the normal range provides profit opportunitiesfor savvy traders. Learning from history can help you keep calm whenothers are losing their heads.\nFutures contracts expire every few months, making long-term charts\ndifficult to analyze. When it comes to dailies, we look at the currentlyactive month, but what about the weeklies? Here we have to use con-tinuous contracts, mathematical devices that splice several contractmonths. It pays to download two data series—the currently active con-tract, going back about six months, and the continuous contract goingback at least two years. Analyze weekly charts using continuous data,and switch to the front month to study daily charts.\nDo You Need Real-Time Data? Real-time data flows to your screen\ntick by tick, as prices change in the markets. A live screen is one of themost captivating sights on Earth, right up there with nude co-ed volley-ball or a chain collision on an expressway. Watching your stock dancein front of your face can help you find the best spots for buying andselling—or make you forget reality and swim in adrenaline.\nWill live data improve your trading? The answer is “yes” for a few,\n“maybe” for some, and “no” for most. Having a live screen on yourdesk, says a trader friend, is like sitting in front of a one-armed bandit.You invariably end up feeding it quarters.\nTrading with live charts looks deceptively easy, while in fact it is one\nof the fastest games on the planet. Buy at 10:05 \nA.M., watch the price rise\na few ticks, and take a couple of hundred dollars off the table by 10:15.Repeat several times a day, and go home at 4 with thousands of dol-lars and no open positions. Sleep like a baby and return in the morn-ing. Trouble is, you need perfect reflexes to do that. If you pause tothink, delay taking a profit, or quibble accepting a loss, you’re dead.\nMost successful day-traders are men in their early 20s. I’ve met very few\nsuccessful day-traders over 30. There are exceptions, of course—a friend38 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nin her 70s is a fantastic day-trader, but she is an exception who confirms\nthe rule. This game requires lightning-fast reflexes, as well as a certainthoughtless capacity to jump, that few of us preserve past the age of 30.\nBeginners do not need live data because they have to put all their\nattention into learning to trade with daily and weekly charts. Once youstart pulling money out of the markets, it might be a good idea to applyyour new skills to intraday charts. When longer-term charts give you abuy or a sell signal, use live data not to day-trade but to dance into orout of positions.\nOnce you decide to use live data, make sure it’s real and not de-\nlayed. Most exchanges charge monthly fees for real-time data, while theInternet is full of websites offering free data, delayed by 20 minutes.That delay does not interfere with the entertainment value, but tradingwith it is suicidal. If you need real-time data, be sure to get the best.\nANALYSIS AND TRADING\nMarkets generate vast volumes of information: annual and quarterlyreports, earnings estimates, corporate insiders’ reports, industry groupstudies, technology forecasts, weekly, daily, and intraday charts, tech-nical indicators, trading volume, opinions in chat rooms, the never-ending discussion circles on the Internet. With so much data, you soonrealize your analysis can never be complete.\nSome traders who have lost money fall into paralysis from analysis.\nThey develop a quaint notion that if they analyze more data, they’llstop losing and become winners. You can recognize them by theirbeautiful charts and shelves crammed with stock reports. They willshow you indicator signals in the middle of any chart, but when youask them what they will do at the right edge, they only mumblebecause they do not trade.\nAnalysts are paid to be right; traders are paid to be profitable. Those\nare two different goals, calling for different temperaments. Institutionstend to separate traders and analysts into different departments. Privatetraders have no such luxury.\nAnalysis quickly reaches the point of diminishing returns. The goal\nis not to be complete but to develop a decision-making process andback it up with money management. You need to develop severalanalytic screens to reduce a huge volume of market information to amanageable size.THE FIRST STEPS 39\nFundamental Analysis\nFundamental analysts predict price movements on the basis of supply\nand demand. In stocks, they study supply and demand for companyproducts. In futures they research supply and demand for commodities.\nHas a company announced a new technological breakthrough? An\nexpansion abroad? A new strategic partnership? A new chief executive?Anything that happens to the business can influence the supply of itsproducts and their costs. Almost everything that happens in society caninfluence the demand.\nFundamental analysis is hard because the importance of different\nfactors changes with the passage of time. For example, during an eco-nomic expansion, fundamental analysts are likely to focus on growthrates, but during a recession, on the safety of dividends. A dividendmay seem like a quaint relic in a go-go bull market, but when the chipsare down the ultimate test of a stock is how much income it generates.A fundamental analyst must keep an eye on the crowd, as it shifts itsattention from market share to technological innovation to whateverelse preoccupies it at the moment. Fundamental analysts study values,but the relationship between values and prices is not direct. It’s thatmile-long rubber band all over again.\nThe job of a fundamental analyst in the futures markets isn’t much\neasier. How do you read the actions of the Federal Reserve, with itsgreat power over interest rates and the economy? How do you ana-lyze weather reports during the critical growing seasons in the grainmarkets? How do you estimate carryover stocks and weather pros-pects in the Southern versus the Northern Hemispheres which are sixmonths apart in their weather cycles? You can spend a lifetime learn-ing the fundamentals, or you can look for capable people who selltheir research.\nFundamental analysis is much more narrow than technical. A mov-\ning average works similarly in soybeans and IBM, on weekly, daily,and intraday charts. MACD-Histogram flashes similar messages inTreasury bonds and Intel. Should we forget about the fundamentalsand concentrate on technicals? Many traders take the path of leastresistance, but I think this is a mistake.\nFundamental factors are very important to a long-term trader who\nwants to ride major trends for several months or years. If the funda-mentals are bullish, we should favor the long side of the market, and40 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nif bearish, the short side. Fundamental analysis is less relevant to a\nshort-term trader or a day-trader.\nYou do not have to become an expert in the fundamental analysis\nof every stock and commodity. There are very intelligent people whospecialize in that, and they publish their research. Many of them alsobang their heads against the walls, unable to understand why, if theyknow so much about their markets, they cannot make money trading.\nIf we can take our ideas from fundamental analysts but filter them\nthrough technical screens, we’ll be miles of head of those who analyzeonly fundamentals or technicals. Bullish fundamentals must be con-firmed by rising technical indicators; otherwise they are suspect.Bearish fundamentals must be confirmed by falling technical indicators.When fundamentals and technicals are in gear, a savvy trader can havea field day.\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?The main book on the fundamental analysis\nof stocks is Security Analysis by Graham and Dodd. Both authors are long\ndead, but the book is being kept up-to-date by their disciples. If youdecide to study it, make sure to get the latest edition. Warren Buffett, astudent of Graham, became one of the richest men in the world. Thereis an easy-to-read book that explains his approach to fundamental analy-sis—The Buffett Way by Robert G. Hagstrom.\nThe best review of futures fundamentals is in The Futures Game by\nTeweles and Jones. This classic volume is being revised and updatedevery 10 years or so (be sure to get the latest edition). It has a sectionon the fundamentals of every futures market. Whether you trade soy-beans or Swiss francs, you can quickly read up on the key factors driv-ing that market.\nTechnical Analysis\nFinancial markets run on a two-party system—bulls and bears. Bullspush prices up, bears push them down, while charts show us theirfootprints. Technical analysts study charts to find where one groupoverpowers the other. They look for repetitive price patterns, trying torecognize uptrends or downtrends in their early stages and generatebuy or sell signals.\nThe role of technical analysis on Wall Street has changed over the\nyears. It was very popular in the early part of the twentieth century,THE FIRST STEPS 41\nushered in by Charles Dow, the founder of The Wall Street Journal\nand the originator of the Dow averages. Several prominent analysts,such as Roger Babson, predicted and identified the 1929 top. Then camea quarter century of exile, when institutional analysts had to hide theircharts if they wanted to keep their jobs. Technical analysis has becomehugely popular since the 1980s. Easy access to personal computers hasput technical software within easy reach of traders.\nThe stock market has become increasingly short-term oriented in\nrecent years. Gone are the days of “buy-and-hold” when people bought“good stocks” for the long run, put them away, and collected divi-dends. The pace of economic change is increasing, and stocks are mov-ing faster and faster. New industries emerge, old ones sink, and manystocks have become more volatile than commodities. Technical analy-sis is well suited for those fast-paced changes.\nThere are two main types of technical analysis: classical and com-\nputerized. Classical analysis is based solely on the study of charts, with-out using anything more complex than a pencil and ruler. Classicaltechnicians look for uptrends and downtrends, support and resistancezones, as well as repetitive patterns, such as triangles and rectangles.It is an easy field to enter, but its main drawback is subjectivity. Whena classical technician feels bullish, his ruler tends to inch up, and whenhe feels bearish, that ruler tends to slide down.\nModern technical analysis relies on computerized indicators whose\nsignals are much more objective. The two main types are trend-following indicators and oscillators. Trend-following indicators, such asmoving averages, Directional System, and MACD (moving averageconvergence-divergence), help identify trends. Oscillators, such as Stochas-tic, Force Index, and Relative Strength Index (RSI) help identify reversals.It is important to select several indicators from both groups, set theirparameters, and stay with them. Amateurs often misuse technical analy-sis by looking for indicators that show them what they want to see.\nThe main tool of technical analysis is neither the pencil nor the com-\nputer, but the organ that every analyst is supposed to have between hisears—the brain. Still, if two technicians are at the same level of devel-opment, the one with a computer has an advantage.\nTechnical analysis is partly a science and partly an art—partly objec-\ntive and partly subjective. It relies on computerized methods, but ittracks crowd psychology, which can never be fully objective. The bestmodel for technical analysis is a public opinion poll. Pollsters use sci-entific methods but need psychological flair to design questions and42 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nselect polling techniques. Price patterns on our computer screens\nreveal crowd behavior. Technical analysis is applied social psychology,the craft of analyzing mass behavior for profit.\nMany beginners, overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data, fall into\nthe trap of automatic trading systems. Their vendors claim to havebacktested the best technical tools and put them together into winningsystems. Whenever an excited beginner tells me he is planning to buyan automatic system, I ask him what he does for a living and whatwould happen if I came to compete with him after buying an automaticdecision-making system in his field. People want to believe in magic,and if that magic can also save them from working and thinking, theygladly pay good money for it.\nSuccessful trading is based on the 3 M’s—Mind, Method, Money.\nTechnical analysis, no matter how clever, is responsible for only one-third of your success. You also need to have sound trading psychologyand proper money management, as you’ll see later in this book.\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?Technical Analysis of Stock Trends by\nEdwards and Magee, written in the first half of the twentieth century,is considered the definitive book on classical charting. Get any editionafter 1955, because that was the last major revision of the book.Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets by John Murphy offers the\nmost thorough review of modern as well as classical technical analy-sis. My first book, Trading for a Living , has large sections on both clas-\nsical and modern technical analysis.\nWhen to Buy and Sell\nThe secret of trading is that there is no secret. There is no magic pass-word to profits. Beginners keep looking for a gimmick, and plenty ofcrafty vendors sell them. In truth, trading is about work—and a bit offlair. It is no different from any other field of human endeavor. Whetheryou do surgery, teach calculus, or fly an airplane, it all boils down toknowing the rules, having the discipline, putting in the work, and hav-ing a bit of flair.\nAn intelligent trader pays attention to fundamentals. He is aware of\nthe key forces in the economy. He spends most of his analytic timeon technical analysis, working to identify trends and reversals. Laterin this book we will review key technical tools and put together atrading plan.THE FIRST STEPS 43\nMarkets keep changing, and flexibility is the name of the game. A\nbrilliant programmer told me recently that he kept losing money butwhoever was buying off of his stops must have been profitable becausehis stops kept nailing the bottoms of declines. I asked why he didn’tstart placing his buy orders where he now placed stops. He wouldn’tdo it because he was too rigid, and for him buy orders were buy ordersand stops were stops. A high level of education can be a handicap intrading. Brian Monieson, a noted Chicago trader, once said in an inter-view, “I have a Ph.D. in mathematics and a background in cybernetics,but I was able to overcome those disadvantages and make money.”\nMany professional people are preoccupied with being right. Engineers\nbelieve that everything can be calculated, and doctors believe that ifthey run enough tests, they’ll come up with the right diagnosis andtreatment. Curing a patient involves a lot more than precision. It is arunning joke how many doctors and lawyers lose money in the mar-kets. Why? Certainly not for lack of intelligence, but for lack of humil-ity and flexibility.\nMarkets operate in an atmosphere of uncertainty. Trading signals are\nclear in the middle of the chart, but as you get closer to the right edge,you find yourself in what John Keegan, the great military historian,called “the fog of war.” There is no certainty, only odds. Here you havetwo goals—to make money and to learn. Win or lose, you have to gainknowledge from a trade in order to be a better trader tomorrow. Scanyour fundamental information, read technical signals, implement yourrules of money management and risk control. Now you are ready topull the trigger. Go!44 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nPART\nTWO\nTHE THREE M’S\nOF SUCCESSFULTRADING\nBuy low, sell high. Short high, cover low. Traders are like surfers,\ntrying to catch good waves, only their beach is rocky, not sandy.\nProfessionals wait for opportunities but amateurs jump in, driven byemotions—they keep buying strength and selling weakness, bleedingtheir equity into the markets. Buy low, sell high sounds like a simplerule, but greed and fear can override the best intentions.\nA professional waits for familiar patterns to emerge from the market.\nHe may notice a new trend with rising momentum, indicating higherprices ahead. Or he may detect the feebleness of momentum during arally, indicating weakness. Once he recognizes a pattern, he puts ona trade. He has a clear notion of how he’ll get in, where he’ll take prof-its, and where he’ll accept a loss if the market turns against him.\nA trade is a bet on a price change, but there is a paradox. Each price\nreflects the latest consensus of value of market participants. Putting ona trade challenges that consensus. A buyer disagrees with the collectivewisdom by saying the market is underpriced. A seller disagrees with thewisdom of the entire group, believing the market is overpriced. Boththe buyer and the seller expect the consensus to change, but meanwhilethey defy the market. That market includes some of the most brilliantminds and some of the deepest pockets on Earth. Arguing with thisgroup is dangerous business, and it has to be done very cautiously.\nAn intelligent trader looks for holes in the efficient market theory.\nHe scans the market for brief periods of inefficiency. When the crowdis gripped by greed, the newcomers jump in and load up on stocks.\nWhen falling prices squeeze the fingers of thousands of buyers, they\ndump their holdings in a panic, disregarding fundamental values. Thoseepisodes of emotional behavior dilute the cold efficiency of the mar-ket, creating opportunities for disciplined traders. When markets arecalm and efficient, trading becomes a crapshoot, with commissions andslippage worsening the odds.\nCrowd mentality changes slowly, and price patterns recur, albeit\nwith variations. Emotional swings provide trading opportunities, whileefficient markets chop up and down, offering no edge to traders, onlypiling up their costs. Technical analysis tools will work for you only ifyou have the discipline to wait for patterns to emerge. Professionalstrade only when markets offer them special advantages.\nAccording to chaos theory, many processes—the flow of water in a\nriver, the movement of clouds in the sky, the changes of prices in thecotton markets—are chaotic, with transient islands of order, called frac-tals. Those fractals look similar from any distance, whether through atelescope or a microscope. The coast of Maine looks just as jaggedfrom a space shuttle as it does when you drop down on your handsand knees and look at it through a magnifying glass. In most finan-cial markets, the long-term weekly charts and the short-term 5-minutecharts look so similar, you cannot tell them apart without markings.Engineers have realized that they can achieve better control over manyprocesses if they accept them as chaotic and try to capitalize on tem-porary fractals, the islands of order. That’s exactly what a good traderdoes. He recognizes the market as chaotic and unpredictable much ofthe time, but expects to find islands of order. He trains himself to buyand sell without quibbling when he finds those patterns.\nSuccessful trading depends on the 3 M’s—Mind, Method, and Money.\nBeginners focus on analysis, but professionals operate in a three-dimensional space. They are aware of trading psychology—their ownfeelings and the mass psychology of the markets. Each trader needs tohave a method for choosing specific stocks, options, or futures as wellas firm rules for pulling the trigger—deciding when to buy and sell.Money refers to how you manage your trading capital.\nMind, Method, Money—trading psychology, trading method, and\nmoney management—people sometimes ask me which of the threeis more important. It is like asking which leg of a three-legged stool isthe most important. Take them away one at a time and then try to sitdown. In Part 2 we focus on those three foundations of market success.46 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nCHAPTER\nFOUR\nMIND—\nTHE DISCIPLINED TRADER*\nTraders come to the markets with great expectations, but few make\nprofits and most wash out. The industry hides good statistics from\nthe public, while promoting its Big Lie that money lost by losers goesto winners. In fact, winners collect only a fraction of the money lost bylosers. The bulk of losses goes to the trading industry as the cost ofdoing business—commissions, slippage, and expenses—by both win-ners and losers. A successful trader must hop over several high hur-dles—and keep hopping. Being better than average is not goodenough—you have to be head and shoulders above the crowd. Youcan win only if you have both knowledge and discipline.\nMost amateurs come to the markets with half-baked trading plans,\nclueless about psychology or money management. Most get hurt andquit after a few painful hits. Others find more cash and return to trad-ing. We do not have to call people who keep dropping money in themarkets losers because they do get something in return. What they getis fantastic entertainment value.\nMarkets are the most entertaining places on the face of the Earth.\nThey are like a card game, a chess game, and a horse race all rolledinto one. The game goes on at all hours—you can always find action.\nAn acquaintance of mine had a terrible home life. He avoided his\nwife by staying late in the office, but the building closed on weekends,pushing him into the bosom of his family. By Sunday mornings hecould take no more “family togetherness” and escaped to the basementof his house. There he had set up a trading apparatus, using the equip-ment loaned to him by another loser in exchange for a share of future\n47*Thanks to Mark Douglas, the title of whose book I borrowed to name this chapter.\nprofits. What can you trade on a Sunday morning in suburban Boston?\nIt turned out that the gold markets were open in the Middle East. Myacquaintance used to turn on his quote screen, get on the phone (thiswas in the pre-Internet days), and trade gold in Abu Dhabi!\nHe never asked himself what his edge was over local traders. What\nhas he got, sitting in a bucolic suburb of Boston, that they haven’t gotin Abu Dhabi? Why should locals send him money? Every professionalknows his edge, but ask an amateur and he’ll draw a blank. A personwho doesn’t know his edge does not have it and will lose money.Warren Buffett, one of the richest investors on Earth, says that whenyou sit down to a game of poker, you must know within 15 minutes whois going to supply the winnings, and if you don’t know the answer, thatperson is you. My Boston buddy wound up losing his house in a bank-ruptcy, which put a whole new spin on his marital problems, eventhough he no longer traded gold in Abu Dhabi.\nMany people, whether rich or poor, feel trapped and bored. As\nHenry David Thoreau wrote almost two centuries ago, “The mass ofmen lead lives of quiet desperation.”\nWe wake up in the same bed each morning, eat the same breakfast,\nand drive to work down the same road. We see the same dull faces inthe office and shuffle papers on our old desks. We drive home, watchthe same dumb shows on TV, have a beer, and go to sleep in the samebed. We repeat this routine day after day, month after month, year afteryear. It feels like a life sentence without parole. What is there to lookforward to? Perhaps a brief vacation next year? We’ll buy a packagedeal, fly to Paris, get on a bus with the rest of the group, and spend15 minutes in front of the Triumphal Arch and half an hour going upthe Eiffel Tower. Then back home, back to the old routine.\nMost people live in a deep invisible groove—no need to think,\nmake decisions, feel the raw edge of life. The routine does feel com-fortable—but deathly boring.\nEven amusements stop being fun. How many Hollywood movies\ncan you watch on a weekend until they all become a blur? How many tripsto Disneyland can you take before all the rides in plastic soap dishesfeel like one endless ride to nowhere? To quote Thoreau again, “Astereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what arecalled games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them.”\nAnd then you open a trading account and punch in an order to buy\n500 shares of Intel. Anyone with a few thousand dollars can escape theroutine and find excitement in the markets.48 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nSuddenly, the world is in living color! Intel ticks up half a point—\nyou check quotes, run out for a newspaper, and tune in for the latestupdates. If you have a computer at work, you set up a little quote win-dow to keep an eye on your stock. Before the Internet, people usedto buy pocket FM receivers for market quotes and hide them in half-open desk drawers. Their antennae, sticking out of desks of middle-aged men, looked like beams of light shining into prison cells.\nIntel is up a point! Should you sell and take profits? Buy more and\ndouble up? Your heart is pounding—you feel alive! Now it’s up threepoints. You multiply that by the number of shares you have and realizethat your profits after just a few hours are close to your weekly salary.You start calculating percentage returns—if you continue trading likethat for the rest of the year, what a fortune you’ll have by Christmas!\nSuddenly you raise your eyes from the calculator to see that Intel has\ndropped two points. Your stomach is tied in a knot, your face pushesinto the screen, you hunch over, compressing your lungs, reducing theflow of blood to the brain, which is a terrible position for making deci-sions. You are flooded with anxiety, like a trapped animal. You arehurting—but you are alive!\nTrading is the most exciting activity that a person can do with\ntheir clothes on. Trouble is, you cannot feel excited and make money\nat the same time. Think of a casino, where amateurs celebrate over freedrinks, while professional card-counters coldly play game after game,folding most of the time, and pressing their advantage when the cardcount gives them a slight edge over the house. To be a successful trader,you have to develop iron discipline (Mind), acquire an edge over themarkets (Method), and control risks in your trading account (Money).\nSLEEPWALKING THROUGH THE MARKETS\nThere is only one rational reason to trade—to make money. Moneyattracts us to the markets, but in the excitement of the new game weoften lose sight of that goal. We start trading for entertainment, as anescape, to show off in front of our family and friends, and so on. Oncea trader loses his focus on money, his goose is cooked.\nIt is easy to feel cool, calm, and collected reading a book or look-\ning at your charts on a weekend. It’s easy to be rational when the mar-kets are closed—but what happens after 30 minutes in front of a livescreen? Does your pulse begin to race? Do upticks and downtickshypnotize you? Traders get an adrenaline rush from the market, andMIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 49\nthe excitement clouds their judgment. Calm resolutions made on a\nweekend fly out the window during rallies or declines. “This time isdifferent . . . It’s an exception . . . I won’t put in a stop now, the mar-ket is too volatile” are the giveaway phrases of emotional traders.\nMany intelligent people sleepwalk through the markets. Their eyes\nare open, but their minds are shut. They are driven by emotions andkeep repeating their mistakes. It is OK to make mistakes but not OKto repeat them. When you make a mistake for the first time, it showsthat you are alive, searching, experimenting. Repeating a mistake is aneurotic symptom.\nLosers come in all genders, ages, and colors, but several stock\nphrases give them away. Let us review some of the common excuses.If you recognize yourself, use that as a sign to start learning a new ap-proach to the markets.\nBlame the Broker\nA trader hears his broker’s voice at the most important and tensemoments—when placing buy or sell orders or requesting informationthat may lead to an order. The broker is close to the market, and manyof us assume that he knows more than we do. We try to read ourbroker’s voice and figure out whether he approves or disapproves ofour actions.\nIs listening to your broker’s voice a part of your trading system? Does\nit say to buy when the weekly moving average is up, daily Force Indexis down, and the broker sounds enthused? Or does it simply say to buywhen such and such indicators reach such and such parameters?\nTrying to read your broker’s voice is a sign of insecurity, a common\nstate for beginners. Markets are huge and volatile, and their rallies anddeclines can feel overpowering. Frightened people look for someonestrong and wise to lead them out of the wilderness. Can your brokerlead you? Probably not, but if you lose money, you’ll have a greatexcuse—it was your broker who put you into that stupid trade.\nA lawyer who was shopping for an expert witness recently called\nme. His client, a university professor, had shorted Dell at 20 severalyears ago, before the splits, after his broker told him it “could not goany higher.” That stock became the darling of the bull market, wentthrough the roof, and a year later the professor covered at 80, wipingout his million-dollar account, which represented his life savings. That50 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nman was smart enough to earn a Ph.D. and save a million dollars but\nemotional enough to follow his broker while his life savings weredoing a slow burn. Few people sue their brokers, but almost all begin-ners blame them.\nTraders’ feelings towards brokers are similar to patients’ feelings\ntowards psychoanalysts. A patient lies on the couch, and the analyst’svoice, emerging at important moments, seems to carry deeper psycho-logical truths than the patient could have possibly discovered him-self. In reality, a good broker is a craftsman who can sometimes helpyou get better fills and dig up information you requested. He is yourhelper—not your advisor. Looking to a broker for guidance is a sign ofinsecurity, which is not conducive to trading success.\nMost people start trading more actively after switching to electronic\nbrokers. Low commissions are a factor, but the psychological changeis more important. People are less self-conscious when they don’t haveto deal with a live person. All of us occasionally make stupid trades,and electronic brokers allow us to make them in private. We are lessashamed hitting a key than calling a broker.\nSome traders manage to transfer their anxieties and fears onto elec-\ntronic brokers. They complain that electronic brokers do not do whatthey want, such as accept certain types of orders. Why don’t you trans-fer your account, I ask—and see fear in their faces. It is the fear ofchange, of upsetting the cart.\nTo be a successful trader, you must accept total responsibility for\nyour decisions and actions.\nBlame the Guru\nA beginner entering the markets soon finds himself surrounded by a col-orful crowd of gurus—experts who sell trading advice. Most charge fees,but some give advice for free to drum up business for their brokeragefirms. Gurus publish newsletters, are quoted in the media, and manywould kill to get on TV. Masses are hungry for clarity, and gurus arethere to feed that hunger. Most are failed traders, but being a guru is notthat easy. Their mortality rate is high, and few stay around for more thantwo years. The novelty wears off, customers do not renew subscriptions,and a guru finds it easier to earn a living selling aluminum siding thandrawing trendlines. My chapter on the guru business in Trading for a\nLiving drew more howls and threats than any other in that book.MIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 51\nTraders go through three stages in their attitudes towards gurus. In\nthe beginning, they drink in their advice, expecting to make moneyfrom it. At the second stage, traders start avoiding gurus like theplague, viewing them as distractions from their own decision-makingprocess. Finally, some successful traders start paying attention to a fewgurus who alert them to new opportunities.\nSome losing traders go looking for a trainer, a teacher, or a therapist.\nVery few people are experts in both psychology and trading. I’ve metseveral gurus who couldn’t trade their way out of a paper bag butclaimed that their alleged expertise in psychology qualified them totrain traders. Stop for a moment and compare this to sex therapy. If Ihad a sexual problem, I might see a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a sextherapist, or even a pastoral counselor, but I would never go to aCatholic priest, even if I were Catholic. That priest has no practicalknowledge of the problem—and if he does, you want to run, not walkaway. A teacher who does not trade is highly suspect.\nTraders go through several stages in their attitudes towards tips.\nBeginners love them, those who are more serious insist on doing theirown homework, while advanced traders may listen to tips but alwaysdrop them into their own trading systems to see whether that advicewill hold up. Whenever I hear a trading tip, I run it through my owncomputerized screens. The decision to buy, go short, or stand aside ismine alone, with an average yield of one tip accepted out of every 20heard. Tips draw my attention to opportunities I might have over-looked, but there are no shortcuts to sweating your own trades.\nA greenhorn who has gotten burned may ask for a guru’s track\nrecord. Years ago I used to publish a newsletter and noticed how fright-eningly easy it was for gurus to massage and slant their records, evenif they were tracked by independent rating services.\nI’ve never met a trader who took all the recommendations of his\nguru, even if he paid him a lot of money. If a guru has 200 subscribers,they’ll choose different recommendations, trade them differently, andmost will lose money, each in his own way. There is a rule in the advi-sory business: “If you make forecasts for a living, make a lot of them.”Gurus offer convenient excuses to sleepwalking traders who need ascapegoat for their losses.\nWhether or not you listen to a guru, you’re 100% responsible for the\noutcome of your trades. The next time you get a hot tip, drop it intoyour trading system to see whether it gives you a buy or sell signal.You are responsible for the consequences of taking or rejecting advice.52 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nBlame the Unexpected News\nIt is easy to feel angry and hurt when a sudden piece of bad news\nblows a hole in your stock. You buy something, it goes up, bad newshits the market, and your stock collapses. The market did it to you, yousay? The news may have been sudden, but you are responsible forhandling any challenges.\nMost company news is released on a regular schedule. If you trade\na certain stock, you should know well in advance when that companyreleases its earnings and be prepared for any market reaction to thenews. Lighten up on your position if unsure about the impact of a com-ing announcement. If you trade bonds, currencies, or stock indexfutures, you must know when the key economic statistics are releasedand how the leading indicators or the unemployment rate can impactyour market. It may be wise to tighten your stops or reduce the size ofyour trade in advance of an important news release.\nWhat about a truly unexpected piece of news—a president gets shot,\na noted analyst comes out with a bearish earnings forecast, and so on?You must research your market and know what happened after simi-lar events in the past; you have to do your homework before the eventhits you. Having this knowledge allows you to act without delay. Forexample, the stock market’s reaction to an assault on a president hasalways been a sharp hiccup to the downside, followed by a completeretracement, so a sensible thing to do is buy the break.\nYour trading plan must include the possibility of a sharp adverse\nmove caused by sudden events. You must have your stop in place, andthe size of your trade must be such that you cannot get financially hurtin the case of a reversal. There are many risks waiting to spring on atrader—you alone are responsible for damage control.\nWishful Thinking\nWhen the pain grows bit by bit, the natural tendency is to do nothingand wait for an improvement. A sleepwalking trader gives his losingtrades “more time to work out,” while they slowly destroy his account.\nA sleepwalker hopes and dreams. He sits on a loss and says, “This\nstock is coming back; it always did.” Winners accept occasional losses,take them, and move on. Losers postpone taking losses. An amateurputs on a trade the way a kid buys a lottery ticket. He waits for thewheel of fortune to decide whether he wins or loses. Professionals, toMIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 53\nthe contrary, have ironclad plans for getting out, either with a profit\nor a small loss. One of the key differences between professionals andamateurs is their planning for exits.\nA sleepwalking trader buys at 35 and puts in a stop at 32. The stock\nsinks to 33, and he says, “I’ll give it a little more room.” He moves hisstop down to 30. That is a fatal mistake—he has breached his disci-pline and violated his own plan.\nYou may move stops only one way—in the direction of your trade.\nStops are like a ratchet on a sailboat, designed to take the slack out ofyour sails. If you start giving your trade “more room to breathe,” that extraslack will swing around and hurt you. When the market rewards tradersfor breaking their rules, it sets up an even deeper trap in their next trade.\nThe best time to make decisions is before you enter a trade. Your\nmoney is not at risk, and you can weigh profit targets and loss param-eters. Once you’re in a trade, you begin to form an attachment to it.The market hypnotizes you and lures you into emotional decisions.This is why you must write down your exit plan and follow it.\nTurning a losing trade into an “investment” is a common disease\namong small private traders, but some institutional traders also sufferfrom it. Disasters at banks and major financial firms occur when poorlysupervised traders lose money in short-term trades and stick them intolong-term accounts, hoping that time will bail them out. If you are los-ing in the beginning, you’ll lose in the end. Do not put off the hour ofreckoning. The first loss is the best loss—this is the rule of those of uswho trade with our eyes open.\nA R EMEDY FOR SELF-DESTRUCTIVENESS\nPeople who like to complain about their bad luck are often experts inlooking for trouble and snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Afriend in the construction business used to have a driver who dreamedof buying his own truck and working for himself. He saved money foryears and finally paid cash for a huge brand-new truck. He quit his job,got gloriously drunk, and at the end of the day rolled his uninsuredtruck down an embankment—it was totaled, and the driver came backasking for his old job. Tragedy? Drama? Or fear of freedom and anunconscious wish for a safe job with a steady paycheck?\nWhy do intelligent people with a track record of success keep losing\nmoney on one harebrained trade after another, stumbling from calamityto catastrophe? Ignorance? Bad luck? Or a hidden desire to fail?54 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nMany people have a self-destructive streak. My experience as a psy-\nchiatrist has convinced me that most people who complain aboutsevere problems are in fact sabotaging themselves. I cannot change apatient’s external reality, but whenever I cure one of self-sabotage, hequickly resolves his external problems.\nSelf-destructiveness is such a pervasive human trait because civiliza-\ntion is built on controlling aggression. As we grow up, we are trainedto control aggression against others—behave, do not push, be nice.Our aggression has to go somewhere, and many turn it against them-selves, the only unprotected target. We turn our anger inward and learnto sabotage ourselves. Little wonder so many of us grow up fearful,inhibited, and shy.\nSociety has several defenses against the extremes of self-sabotage.\nThe police will talk a potential suicide down from the roof, and themedical board will take the scalpel away from an accident-prone sur-geon, but no one will stop a self-defeating trader. He can run amok inthe financial markets, inflicting wounds on himself, while brokers andother traders gladly take his money. Financial markets lack protectivecontrols against self-sabotage.\nAre you sabotaging yourself? The only way to find out is to keep\ngood records, especially a Trader’s Journal and an equity curve, shownlater in this book. The angle of your equity curve is an objective indi-cator of your behavior. If it slopes up, with few downticks, you’redoing well. If it points down, it shows you’re not in gear with the mar-kets and possibly in a self-sabotage mode. When you observe that,reduce the size of your trades and spend more time with your Trader’sJournal figuring out what you’re doing.\nYou need to become a self-aware trader. Keep good records, learn\nfrom past mistakes, and do better in the future. Traders who losemoney tend to feel ashamed. A bad loss feels like a nasty comment—most people just want to cover up, walk away, and never be seenagain. Hiding doesn’t solve anything. Use the pain of a loss to turnyourself into a disciplined winner.\nLosers Anonymous\nYears ago I had an insight that changed my trading life forever. Backin those days my equity used to swing up and down like a yo-yo. Iknew enough about markets to profit from many trades but couldn’thold on to my gains and grow equity. The insight that eventually gotMIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 55\nme off the roller coaster came from a chance visit to a meeting of\nAlcoholics Anonymous.\nOne late afternoon I accompanied a friend to an AA meeting at a\nlocal YMCA. Suddenly, the meeting gripped me. I felt as if the peoplein the room were talking about my trading! All I had to do was substi-tute the word lossfor the word alcohol .\nPeople at the AA meeting talked about how alcohol controlled their\nlives, and my trading in those days was driven by losses—fearing themand trying to trade my way out. My emotions followed a jagged equitycurve—elation at the highs and cold clammy fear at the lows, with fin-gers trembling above the speed dial button.\nBack in those days I had a busy psychiatric practice and saw my\nshare of alcoholics. I began to notice similarities between them and los-ing traders. Losers approached markets the way alcoholics walked intobars. They entered with pleasant expectations, but left with meanheadaches, hangovers, and loss of control. Drinking and trading lurepeople across the line from pleasure to self-destructiveness.\nAlcoholics and losers live with their eyes closed—both are in the\ngrip of an addiction. Every alcoholic I saw in my office wanted to argueabout his diagnosis. To avoid wasting time, I used to suggest a simpletest. I’d tell alcoholics to keep on drinking as usual for the next week,but write down every drink, and bring that record to our next appoint-ment. Not a single alcoholic could keep that diary for more than a fewdays because looking in a mirror reduced the pleasure of impulsivebehavior. Today when I tell losing traders to keep a diary of theirtrades, many become annoyed.\nGood records are a sign of self-awareness and discipline. Poor or\nabsent records are a sign of impulsive trading. Show me a trader withgood records, and I’ll show you a good trader.\nAlcoholics and losers do not think about the past or the future, and\nfocus only on the present—the sensation of alcohol pouring downthe gullet or the market pulsing on the screen. An active alcoholic isin denial; he doesn’t want to know about the depth of his abyss, theseverity of his problem, or the harm he is causing himself and others.\nThe only thing that can pierce an alcoholic’s denial is the pain of hit-\nting what AA calls “rock bottom.” It is each individual’s private versionof hell—a life-threatening illness, a rejection by family, a job loss, oranother catastrophic event. The unbearable pain of hitting rock bottompunctures the alcoholic’s denial and forces him to face a stark choice:he can self-destruct or turn his life around.56 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAA is a nonprofit voluntary organization whose only purpose is to\nhelp alcoholics stay sober. It doesn’t ask for donations, advertise,lobby, or take part in any public actions. It has no paid therapists;members help each other at meetings led by long-term members. AAhas a system of sponsorships whereby older members sponsor andsupport newer ones.\nAn alcoholic who joins AA goes through what is called a 12-Step\nprogram. Each step is a stage of personal growth and recovery. Themethod is so effective that people recovering from other addictivebehaviors have begun to use it. \nThe first step is the most important for traders. It looks easy, but is\nextremely hard to take. Many alcoholics can’t take it, drop out of AA,and go on to destroy their lives. The first step consists of standing upat a meeting, facing a room full of recovering alcoholics, and admittingthat alcohol is stronger than you. This is hard because if alcohol isstronger than you, you cannot touch it again. Once you take the firststep, you are committed to a struggle for sobriety.\nAlcohol is such a powerful drug that AA recommends planning to\nlive without it one day at a time. A recovering alcoholic does not planto be sober a year or five years from now. He has a simpler goal—goto bed sober tonight. Eventually those days of sobriety add up to years.The entire system of AA meetings and sponsorships is geared towardthe goal of sobriety one day at a time.\nAA aims to change not only the behavior but the personality in order\nto reinforce sobriety. AA members call some people “sober drunks.” Itsounds like a contradiction in terms. If a person is sober, how can hebe a drunk? Sobriety alone is not enough. A person who has notchanged his thinking is just one step away from sliding back into drink-ing under stress or out of boredom. An alcoholic has to change his wayof being and feeling to recover from alcoholism.\nI never had a problem with alcohol, but my psychiatric experience\nhad taught me to respect AA for its success with alcoholics. It was nota popular view. Each patient who went to AA reduced the profession’sincome, but that never bothered me. After my first AA meeting I real-ized that if millions of alcoholics could recover by following the pro-gram, then traders could stop losing, regain balance, and becomewinners by applying the principles of AA.\nHow can we translate the lessons of AA into the language of trading?A losing trader is in denial. His equity is shrinking, but he continues\nto jump into trades without analyzing what is going wrong. He keepsMIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 57\nswitching between markets the way an alcoholic switches between\nwhiskey and cheap wine. An amateur whose mind isn’t strong enoughto accept a small loss will eventually take the mother of all losses. Agaping hole in a trading account hurts self-esteem. A single huge lossor a series of bad losses smash a trader against his rock bottom. Mostbeginners collapse and wash out. The lifetime of an average specula-tor is measured in months, not years.\nThose who survive fall into two groups. Some return to their old ways,\njust like alcoholics crawl into a bar after surviving a bout of delirium.They toss more money into their accounts and become customers ofvendors who sell magical trading systems. They continue to gamble,only now their hands shake from anxiety and fear when they try to pullthe trigger.\nA minority of traders that hit rock bottom decide to change. Recovery\nis a slow and solitary process. Charles Mackay, the author of one of thebest books on crowd psychology, wrote almost two centuries ago thatmen go mad in crowds, but come to their senses slowly, and one by one.I wish we had an organization for recovering traders, the way recover-ing alcoholics have AA. We don’t because trading is so competitive.Members of AA strive for sobriety together, but a meeting of recoveringtraders could easily be poisoned by envy and showing off. Markets aresuch cutthroat places that we don’t form mutual support groups orfind sponsors. Some opportunists hold themselves out as traders’ coaches,but most make me shudder at their sharkiness. If we had a traders’ or-ganization, I’d call it Losers Anonymous (LA). The name is blunt, but\nthat’s fine. After all, Alcoholics Anonymous does not call itself Dr inkers\nAnonymous. A harsh name helps traders face their impulsivity and self-sabotage. Since we do not have LA, you’ll have to walk on the road torecovery alone. I wrote this book to help you along the way.\nBusinessman’s Risk vs. Loss\nYears ago, when I began my recovery from losing, each morning I heldwhat I called a Losers Anonymous meeting for one. I’d come into theoffice, turn on my quote screen, and while it was warming up I’d say,“Good morning, my name is Alex, and I am a loser. I have it in me todo serious damage to my account. I’ve done it before. My only goal fortoday is to go home without a loss.” When the screen was up, I’d begintrading, following the plan written down the night before while themarkets were closed.58 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nI can immediately hear an objection—what do you mean, go home\nwithout a loss? It is impossible to make money every day. What hap-pens if you buy something, and it goes straight down—in other words,you’ve bought the top tick of the day? What if you sell something shortand it immediately rallies?\nWe must draw a clear line between a loss and a businessman’s risk.\nA businessman’s risk is a small dip in equity. A loss goes through thatlimit. As a trader, I am in the business of trading and must take normalbusiness risks, but I cannot afford losses.\nImagine you’re not trading but running a fruit and vegetable stand.\nYou take a risk each time you buy a crate of tomatoes. If your cus-tomers do not buy them, that crate will rot on you. That’s a normalbusiness risk—you expect to sell most of your inventory, but some fruitand vegetables will spoil. As long as you buy carefully, keeping theunsold spoiled fruit to a small percentage of your daily volume, yourbusiness stays profitable.\nImagine that a wholesaler brings a tractor-trailer full of exotic fruit to\nyour stand and tries to sell you the entire load. He says that you canearn more in the next two days than you made in the previous sixmonths. It sounds great—but what if your customers don’t buy thatexotic fruit? A rotting tractor-trailer load can hurt your business andendanger its survival. It’s no longer a businessman’s risk—it’s a loss.\nMoney management rules draw a straight line between a business-\nman’s risk and a loss, as you will see later in this book.\nSome traders have argued that my AA approach is too negative. A\nyoung woman in Singapore told me she believed in positive thinkingand thought of herself as a winner. She could afford to be positivebecause discipline was imposed on her from the outside, by the man-ager of the bank for which she traded. Another winner who arguedwith me was a lady from Texas in her seventies, a wildly successfultrader of stock index futures. She was very religious and viewed her-self as a steward of money. Each morning she got up early and prayedlong and hard. Then she drove to the office and traded the living day-lights out of the S&P. The minute a trade went against her, she’d cutand run—because the money belonged to the Lord and wasn’t hers tolose. She kept her losses small and accumulated profits.\nI thought that our approaches had a lot in common. Both of us\nhad principles outside the market preventing us from losing money.Markets are the most permissive places in the world. You may do any-MIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 59\nthing you like, as long as you have enough equity to put on a trade.\nIt’s easy to get caught in the excitement, which is why you need rules.I rely on the principles of AA, another trader relies on her religiousfeelings, and you may choose something else. Just make sure you havea set of principles that clearly tells you what you may or may not doin the markets.\nSober in Battle\nMost traders open accounts with money earned in business or the pro-fessions. Many bring a personal track record of success and expect todo well in the markets. If we can run a hotel, perform eye surgery, ortry cases in court, we can surely find our way between the high, thelow, and the close! But the markets, which seem so simple at first, keephumbling us.\nLittle blood gets spilled in trading, but the money, the lifeblood of\nthe markets, has a major impact on the quality and the length of ourlives. Recently, a friend who writes a stock market advisory showedme a stack of letters from his subscribers. The one that caught myeye came from a man who made enough money trading to pay for akidney transplant. It saved his life, but I thought of what happenedto legions of others who also had big needs but traded poorly andlost m oney.\nTrading is a battle. When you pick up your weapon and put your\nlife on the line, would you rather be drunk or sober? You have to pre-pare yourself, choose your fight, go in when you are ready, and quitafter you’ve done what you’ve planned. A man who is cool and sobercalmly picks his fights. He enters and leaves when he chooses and notwhen some bully throws him a challenge. A disciplined player chooseshis own game out of hundreds available. He doesn’t have to chaseevery rabbit like a dog with its tongue hanging out—he lays an ambushfor his game and lets it come to him.\nMost amateurs won’t admit they are trading for entertainment. A\ncommon cover story is that they’re in the markets to make money. Inreality, most traders get tremendous thrills tossing money at half-bakedideas. Trading financial markets is more respectable than betting onponies, but the kicks are just as good.\nI tell my horse-playing friends to imagine going to a race where you\ncan place bets after the horses are out of the gate and take your money60 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\noff the table before the race ends. Trading is a fantastic game, but its\ntemptations are very intense.\nTHEMATURE TRADER\nSuccessful traders are sharp, curious, and unassuming people. Mosthave been through losing periods. They graduated from the school ofhard knocks, and that experience helped smooth their rough edges.\nSuccessful traders are self-assured but never arrogant. People who sur-\nvive in the markets remain alert. They trust their skills and trading meth-ods, but keep their eyes and ears open for new developments. Confidentand attentive, calm and flexible, successful traders are fun to be with.\nSuccessful traders are often unconventional people, and some are\nvery eccentric. When they mix with others, they often break social rules.\nThe markets are set up for the majority to lose money, and a small group\nof winners marches to a different drummer, in and out of the markets.\nMarkets consist of huge crowds of people watching the same trad-\ning vehicles, mesmerized by upticks and downticks. Think of a crowdat a concert or in a movie theater. When the show begins, the crowdgets emotionally in gear and develops an amorphous but powerfulmass mind, laughing or weeping together. A mass mind also emergesin the markets, only here it is more malignant. Instead of laughing orweeping, the crowd seeks each trader’s private psychological weak-ness and hits him in that spot.\nMarkets seduce greedy traders into buying positions that are too\nlarge for their accounts and then destroy them with a reaction they can-not afford to sit out. They shake fearful traders out of winning tradeswith brief countertrend spikes before embarking on runaway moves.Lazy traders are the favorite victims of the market, which keeps throw-ing new tricks at the unprepared. Whatever your psychological flawsand fears, whatever your inner demons, whatever your hidden weak-nesses and obsessions, the market will seek them out, find them, anduse them against you, like a skilled wrestler uses his opponent’s ownweight to toss him to the ground.\nSuccessful traders have outgrown or overcome their inner demons.\nInstead of being tossed by the markets, they maintain their own bal-ance and scan for chinks in the crowd’s armor, so that they can tossthe market for a change. They may appear eccentric, but when itcomes to trading they are much healthier than the crowd.MIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 61\nBeing a trader is a journey of self-discovery. Trade long enough, and\nyou will face all your psychological handicaps—anxiety, greed, fear,anger, and sloth. Remember, you’re not in the markets for psychother-apy; self-discovery is a byproduct, not the goal of trading. The primarygoal of a successful trader is to accumulate equity. Healthy tradingboils down to two questions you need to ask in every trade: “What ismy profit target?” and “How will I protect my capital?”\nA good trader accepts full responsibility for the outcome of every\ntrade. You cannot blame others for taking your money. You have toimprove your trading plans and methods of money management. It willtake time, and it will take discipline.\nDiscipline\nA friend of mine used to have a dog-training business. Occasionally aprospective client would call her and say, “I want to train my dog tocome when called, but I do not want to train it to sit or lie down.” Andshe’d answer, “Training a dog to come off-leash is one of the hardestthings to teach; you must do a lot of obedience training first. Whatyou’re saying sounds like, ‘I want my dog be a neurosurgeon, but I donot want it to go to high school.’”\nMany new traders expect to sit in front of their screens and make\neasy money day-trading. They skip high school and head straight forneurosurgery.\nDiscipline is necessary for success in most endeavors, but especially\nin the markets because they have no external controls. You have towatch yourself because no one else will, except for the margin clerk.You may put on the stupidest and self-destructive trades, but as long asyou have enough money in your account, no one will stop you. No onewill say hold on, wait, think what you’re doing! Your broker will repeatyour order to confirm he got it right. Once your order hits the market,other traders will scramble for the privilege of taking your money.\nMost fields of human endeavor have rules, yardsticks, and profes-\nsional bodies to enforce discipline. No matter how independent youfeel, there is always some agency looking over your shoulder. If a doc-tor in private practice starts writing too many prescriptions for pain-killers, he’ll soon hear from the health department. Markets impose norestrictions, as long as you have enough equity. Adding to losing posi-tions is similar to overprescribing narcotics, but nobody will stop you.As a matter of fact, other market participants want you to be undisci-62 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nplined and impulsive. That makes it easier for them to get your money.\nYour defense against self-destructiveness is discipline. You have to setup your own rules and follow them in order to prevent self-sabotage.\nDiscipline means designing, testing, and following your trading sys-\ntem. It means learning to enter and exit in response to predefined sig-nals rather than jumping in and out on a whim. It means doing theright thing, not the easy thing. And the first challenge on the road todisciplined trading involves setting up a record-keeping system.\nRecord-Keeping\nGood traders keep good records. They keep them not just for theiraccountants but as tools of learning and discipline. If you do not havegood records, how can you measure your performance, rate yourprogress, and learn from your mistakes? Those who do not learn fromthe past are doomed to repeat it.\nWhen you decide to become a trader, you sign up for an expensive\ncourse. By the time you figure out the game, its cost may equal that ofa college education, only most students never graduate—they drop outand get nothing for their money except for memories of a few wild rides.\nWhenever you decide to improve your performance in any area of\nlife, record keeping helps. If you want to become a better runner, keep-ing records of your speeds is essential for designing better workouts.If money is a problem, keeping and reviewing records of all ex-penditures is certain to uncover wasteful tendencies. Keeping scrupu-lous records turns a spotlight on a problem and allows you to improve.\nBecoming a good trader means taking several courses—psychology,\ntechnical analysis, and money management. Each course requires itsown set of records. You’ll have to score high on all three in order tograduate.\nYour first essential record is a spreadsheet of all your trades. You have\nto keep track of entries and exits, slippage and commissions, as wellas profits and losses. Chapter 5, “Method—Technical Analysis” on trad-ing channels will teach you to rate the quality of every trade, allowingyou to compare performance across different markets and conditions.\nAnother essential record shows the balance in your account at the\nend of each month. Plot it on a chart, creating an equity curve whoseangle will tell you whether you are in gear with the market. The goalis a steady uptrend, punctuated by shallow declines. If your curveslopes down, it shows you’re not in tune with the markets and mustMIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 63\nreduce the size of your trades. A jagged equity curve tends to be a sign\nof impulsive trading.\nYour trading diary is the third essential record. Whenever you enter\na trade, print out the charts that prompted you to buy or sell. Pastethem on the left page of a large notebook and write a few wordsexplaining why you bought or sold, stating your profit objective and astop. When you close out that trade, print out the charts again, pastethem on the right page and write what you’ve learned from the com-pleted trade.\nThese records are essential for all traders, and we will return to them\nlater in Chapter 8, “The Organized Trader.” A shoebox crammed withconfirmation slips does not qualify as a record-keeping system. Toomany records? Not enough time? Want to skip high school and diveinto neurosurgery? Traders fail because of impatience and lack of dis-cipline. Good records set you apart from the market crowd and putyou on the road to success.\nTraining for Battle\nHow much training you need depends on the job you want. If youwant to be a janitor, an hour of training might do. Just learn to attacha mop to the right end of the broomstick and find a pail without holes.If, on the other hand, you want to fly an airplane or do surgery, you’llhave to learn a great deal more. Trading is closer to flying a plane thanto mopping a floor, meaning you’ll need to invest a lot of time andenergy in mastering this craft.\nSociety mandates extensive training for pilots and doctors because\ntheir errors are so deadly. As a trader, you are free to be financiallydeadly to yourself—society does not care, because your loss is some-one else’s gain. Flying and medicine have standards and yardsticks, aswell as professional bodies to enforce them. In trading, you have to setup your own rules and be your own enforcer.\nPilots and doctors learn from instructors who impose discipline on\nthem through tests and evaluations. Private traders have no externalsystem for learning, testing, or discipline. Our job is hard because wemust learn on our own, develop discipline, and test ourselves againand again in the markets.\nWhen we look at training for pilots and doctors, three features stand\nout. They are the gradual assumption of responsibility, constant evalu-64 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nations, and training until actions become automatic. Let us see whether\nwe can apply them to trading.\n1. The Gradual Assumption of Responsibility A flying school doesn’t\nput a beginner into a pilot’s seat on his first day. A medical student islucky if he is allowed to take a patient’s temperature on his first day inthe hospital. His superiors double-check him before he can advance tothe next, slightly higher level of responsibility.\nHow does this compare to the education of a new trader? There is nothing gradual about it. Most people start out on an im-\npulse, after hearing a hot tip or a rumor of someone making money. Abeginner has some cash burning a hole in his pocket. He gets a bro-ker’s name out of a newspaper, FedExes him a check, and enters hisfirst trade. Now he is starting to learn! When do they close this market?What is a gap opening? How come the market is up and my stock isdown?\nA “sink or swim” approach does not work in complex enterprises,\nsuch as flying or trading. It is exciting to jump in, but excitement isnot what good traders are after. If you do not have a specific trading plan,you’re better off taking your money to Vegas. The outcome will be thesame, but at least there they’ll throw in some free drinks.\nIf you are serious about learning to trade, start with a relatively small\naccount and set a goal of learning to trade rather than making a lot ofmoney in a hurry. Keep a trading diary and put a performance gradeon every trade.\n2. Constant Evaluations and Ratings The progress of a flying cadet\nor a medical student is measured by hundreds of tests. Teachers con-stantly rate knowledge, skills, and decision-making ability. A studentwith good results is given more responsibility, but if his performanceslips, he has to study more and take more tests.\nDo traders go through a similar process?As long as you have money in your account, you can make impul-\nsive trades, trying to weasel your way out of a hole. You can throwconfirmation slips into a shoebox, and give them to your accountant attax time. No one can force you to look at your test results, unless youdo it yourself.\nThe market tests us all the time, but only a few pay attention. It gives\na performance grade to every trade and posts those ratings, but fewMIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 65\npeople know where to look them up. Another highly objective test is\nour equity curve. If you trade several markets, you can take this test inevery one of them, as well as in your account as a whole. Do most ofus take this test? No. Pilots and doctors must answer to their licensingbodies, but traders sneak out of class because no one takes attendanceand their internal discipline is weak. Meanwhile, tests are a key part oftrading discipline, essential for your victory in the markets. Keepingand reviewing records, as outlined later in this book, puts you a mileahead of undisciplined competitors.\n3. Training until Actions Become Automatic During one of my\nfinals in medical school I was sent to examine a patient in a half-emptyroom. Suddenly I heard a noise from behind the curtain. I looked, andthere was another patient—dying. “No pulse,” I yelled to another stu-dent, and together we put the man on the floor. I began pumping hischest, while the other fellow gave him mouth to mouth, one forcedbreath for four chest pumps. Neither of us could run for help, butsomeone opened the door and saw us. A reanimation team raced in,zapped the man with a defibrillator and pulled him out. \nI never had to revive anyone before, but it worked the first time\nbecause I had five years of training. When the time came to act, I didn’thave to think. The point of training is to make actions automatic, allow-ing us to concentrate on strategy.\nWhat will you do if your stock jumps five points in your favor? Five\npoints against you? What if your future goes limit up? Limit down? If youhave to stop and think while you’re in a trade, you’re dead. You needto spend time preparing trading plans and deciding in advance whatyou will do when the market does any imaginable thing. Play those sce-narios in your head, use your computer, and get yourself to the pointwhere you do not have to ruminate about what to do if the market jumps.\nThe mature trader arrives at a stage where most trading actions have\nbecome nearly automatic. This gives you the freedom to think aboutstrategy. You think about what you want to achieve, and less about tac-tics of how to achieve it. To reach that point, you need to trade for along time. The longer you trade and the more trades you put on, themore you’ll learn. Trade a small size while learning and put on manytrades. Remember, the first item on the agenda for a beginner is tolearn how to trade, not to make money. Once you’ve learned to trade,money will follow.66 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nCHAPTER\nFIVE\nMETHOD—\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS\nWill this stock rise or fall? Should you go long or short? Traders reach\nfor a multitude of tools to find answers to these questions. Many tie\nthemselves into knots trying to choose between pattern recognition, com-puterized indicators, artificial intelligence, or even astrology for some des-perate souls.\nNo one can learn all the analytic methods, just as no one can master\nevery field of medicine. A physician cannot become a specialist in heartsurgery, obstetrics, and psychiatry. No trader can know everything aboutthe markets. You have to find a niche that attracts you and specialize in it.\nMarkets emit huge volumes of information. Our tools help organize\nthese flows into a manageable form. It is important to select analytic toolsand techniques that make sense to you, put them together into a coherentsystem, and focus on money management. When we make our tradingdecisions at the right edge of the chart, we deal with probabilities, not cer-tainties. If you want certainty, go to the middle of the chart and try to finda broker who will accept your orders.\nThis chapter on technical analysis shows how one trader goes about\nanalyzing markets. Use it as a model for choosing your favorite tools,rather than following it slavishly. Test any method you like on your owndata because only personal testing will convert information into knowl-edge and make these methods your own.\nMany concepts in this book are illustrated with charts. I selected them\nfrom a broad range of markets—stocks as well as futures. Technical analy-sis is a universal language, even though the accents differ. You can applywhat you’ve learned from the chart of IBM to silver or Japanese yen. I trademostly in the United States, but have used the same methods in Germany,\n67\nRussia, Singapore, and Australia. Knowing the language of technical analy-\nsis enables you to read any market in the world.\nAnalysis is hard, but trading is much harder. Charts reflect what has\nhappened. Indicators reveal the balance of power between bulls andbears. Analysis is not an end in itself, unless you get a job as an analystfor a company. Our job as traders is to make decisions to buy, sell, orstand aside on the basis of our analysis.\nAfter reviewing each chart, you need to go to its hard right edge and\ndecide whether to bet on bulls, bet on bears, or stand aside. You mustfollow up chart analysis by establishing profit targets, setting stops, andapplying money management rules.\nBASICCHARTING\nA trade is a bet on a price change. You can make money buying low andselling high or shorting high and covering low. Prices are central to ourenterprise, yet few traders stop to think what prices are. What exactly arewe trying to analyze?\nFinancial markets consist of huge crowds of people who meet on the\nfloor of an exchange, on the phone, or via the Internet. We can dividethem into three groups: buyers, sellers, and undecided traders. Buyerswant to buy as cheaply as possible. Sellers want to sell as expensively aspossible. They could take forever to negotiate, but feel pressure fromundecided traders. They have to act quickly, before some undecidedtrader makes up his mind, jumps into the game, and takes away their bar-gain. Undecided traders are the force that speeds up trading. They are truemarket participants, as long as they watch the market and have the moneyto trade it. Each deal is struck in the midst of the market crowd, puttingpressure on both buyers and sellers. This is why each trade represents thecurrent emotional state of the entire market crowd.\nPrice is a consensus of value of all market participants expressed in\naction at the moment of the trade.\nMany traders have no clear idea what they are trying to analyze. Balance\nsheets of companies? Pronouncements of the Federal Reserve? Weatherreports from soybean-growing states? The cosmic vibrations of Gann the-ory? Every chart serves as an ongoing poll of the market. Each tick repre-sents a momentary consensus of value of all market participants. High andlow prices, the height of every bar, the angle of every trendline, the dura-tion of every pattern reflect aspects of crowd behavior. Recognizing thesepatterns can help us decide when to bet on bulls or bears.68 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nDuring an election campaign pollsters call thousands of people asking\nhow they’ll vote. Well-designed polls have predictive value, which is whypoliticians pay for them. Financial markets run on a two-party system—bullsand bears, with a huge silent majority of undecided traders who may throwtheir weight to either party. Technical analysis is a poll of market partici-pants. If bulls are on top, we should cover shorts and go long. If bears arestronger, we should go short. If an election is too close to call, a wise traderstands aside. Standing aside is a legitimate market position and the only onein which you can’t lose money.\nIndividual behavior is difficult to predict. Crowds are much more prim-\nitive and their behavior more repetitive and predictable. Our job is not toargue with the crowd, telling it what’s rational or irrational. We need toidentify crowd behavior and decide how likely it is to continue. If thetrend is up and we find that the crowd is growing more optimistic, weshould trade that market from the long side. When we find that the crowdis becoming less optimistic, it is time to sell. If the crowd seems confused,we should stand aside and wait for the market to make up its mind.\nThe Meaning of Prices\nHighs and lows, opening and closing prices, intraday swings and weeklyranges reflect crowd behavior. Our charts, indicators, and technical tools arewindows into the mass psychology of the markets. You have to be clearabout what you are studying if you want to get closer to the truth.\nMany market participants have backgrounds in science and engineering\nand are often tempted to apply the principles of physics. For example, theymay try to filter out the noise of a trading range to obtain a clear signal ofa trend. Those methods can help, but they cannot be converted into auto-matic trading systems because the markets are not physical processes. Theyare reflections of crowd psychology, which follows different, less preciselaws. In physics, if you calculate everything, you’ll predict where a processwill take you. Not so in the markets, where a crowd can always throw youa curve. Here you have to act within this atmosphere of uncertainty, whichis why you must protect yourself with good money management.\nThe Open The opening price, the first price of the day, is marked on a\nbar chart by a tick pointing to the left. An opening price reflects the influxof overnight orders. Who placed those orders? A dentist who read a tip ina magazine after dinner, a teacher whose broker touted a trade but whoneeded his wife’s permission to buy, a financial officer of a slow-movingMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 69\ninstitution who sat in a meeting all day waiting for his idea to be approved\nby a committee. They are the people who place orders before the open.Opening prices reflect opinions of less informed market participants.\nWhen outsiders buy or sell, who takes the opposite side of their trades?\nMarket professionals step in to help, only they do not run a charity. If floortraders see more buy orders coming in, they open the market higher, forc-ing outsiders to overpay. The pros go short, so that the slightest dip makesthem money. If the crowd is fearful before the opening and sell orders pre-dominate, the floor opens the market very low. They acquire their goodson the cheap, so that the slightest bounce earns them short-term profits.\nThe opening price establishes the first balance of the day between out-\nsiders and insiders, amateurs and professionals. If you are a short-termtrader, pay attention to the opening range—the high and the low of thefirst 15 to 30 minutes of trading. Most opening ranges are followed bybreakouts, which are important because they show who is taking controlof the market. Several intraday trading systems are based on followingopening range breakouts.\nOne of the best opportunities to enter a trade occurs when the market gaps\nat the open in the direction opposite your intended trade. Suppose you ana-lyze a market at night and your system tells you to buy a stock. A piece ofbad news hits the market overnight, sell orders come in, and that stock openssharply lower. Once prices stabilize within the opening range, if you are stillbullish and that range is above your planned stop-loss point, place your buyorder a few ticks above the high of the opening range, with a stop below.You may pick up good merchandise on sale!\nThe High Why do prices go up? The standard answer—more buyers\nthan sellers—makes no sense because for every trade there is a buyer anda seller. The market goes up when buyers have more money and are moreenthusiastic than sellers.\nBuyers make money when prices go up. Each uptick adds to their prof-\nits. They feel flushed with success, keep buying, call friends and tell themto buy—this thing is going up! Eventually, prices rise to a level where bullshave no more money to spare and some start taking profits. Bears see themarket as overpriced and hit it with sales. The market stalls, turns, andbegins to fall, leaving behind the high point of the day. That point marksthe greatest power of bulls for that day.\nThe high of every bar reflects the maximum power of bulls during that\nbar. It shows how high bulls could lift the market during that time period.The high of a daily bar reflects the maximum power of bulls during that70 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nday, the high of a weekly bar shows the maximum power of bulls during\nthat week, and the high of a five-minute bar shows their maximum powerin those five minutes.\nThe Low Bears make money when prices fall, with each downtick mak-\ning money for short sellers. As prices slide, bulls become more and moreskittish. They cut back their buying and step aside, figuring they’ll be ableto pick up what they want cheaper at a later time. When buyers pull intheir horns, it becomes easier for bears to push prices lower, and thedecline continues.\nIt takes money to sell stocks short, and a fall in prices slows down when\nbears start running low on money. Bullish bargain hunters appear on thescene. Experienced traders recognize what’s happening and start coveringshorts and going long. Prices rally from their lows, leaving behind the lowmark—the lowest tick of the day.\nThe low point of each bar reflects the maximum power of bears during\nthat bar. The lowest point of a daily bar reflects the maximum power ofbears during that day, the low point of a weekly bar shows the maximumpower of bears during that week, and the low of a five-minute bar showsthe maximum power of bears during those five minutes. Several years agoI designed an indicator, called Elder-ray, for tracking the relative power ofbulls and bears by measuring how far the high and the low of each barget away from the average price.\nThe Close The closing price is marked on a bar chart by a tick pointing\nto the right. It reflects the final consensus of value for the day. This is theprice at which most people look in their daily newspapers. It is especiallyimportant in the futures markets, because the settlement of tradingaccounts depends on it.\nProfessional traders monitor markets throughout the day. Early in the\nday they take advantage of opening prices, selling high openings andbuying low openings, and then unwinding those positions. Their normalmode of operations is to fade—trade against—market extremes and for thereturn to normalcy. When prices reach a new high and stall, professionalssell, nudging the market down. When prices stabilize after a fall, they buy,helping the market rally.\nThe waves of buying and selling by amateurs that hit the market at the\nopening usually subside as the day goes on. Outsiders have done whatthey planned to do, and near the closing time the market is dominated byprofessional traders.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 71\nClosing prices reflect the opinions of professionals. Look at any chart,\nand you’ll see how often the opening and closing ticks are at the oppo-site ends of a price bar. This is because amateurs and professionals tendto be on the opposite sides of trades.\nCandlesticks and Point and Figure Bar charts are most widely used for\ntracking prices, but there are other methods. Candlestick charts becamepopular in the West in the 1990s. Each candle represents a day of tradingwith a body and two wicks, one above and another below. The bodyreflects the spread between the opening and closing prices. The tip of theupper wick reaches the highest price of the day and the lower wick thelowest price of the day. Candlestick chartists believe that the relationshipbetween the opening and closing prices is the most important piece ofdaily data. If prices close higher than they opened, the body of the can-dle is white, but if prices close lower, the body is black.\nThe height of a candle body and the length of its wicks reflect the battles\nbetween bulls and bears. Those patterns, as well as patterns formed by sev-eral neighboring candles, provide useful insights into the power struggle inthe m arkets and can help us decide whether to go long or short.\nThe trouble with candles is they are too fat. I can glance at a computer\nscreen with a bar chart and see five to six months of daily data, withoutsqueezing the scale. Put a candlestick chart in the same space, and you’llbe lucky to get two months of data on the screen. Ultimately, a candle-stick chart doesn’t reveal anything more than a bar chart. If you draw anormal bar chart and pay attention to the relationships of opening andclosing prices, augmenting that with several technical indicators, you’ll beable to read the markets just as well and perhaps better. Candlestickcharts are useful for some but not all traders. If you like them, use them.If not, focus on your bar charts and don’t worry about missing somethingessential.\nPoint and figure (P&F) charts are based solely on prices, ignoring vol-\nume. They differ from bar and candlestick charts by having no horizontaltime scale. When markets become inactive, P&F charts stop drawingbecause they add a new column of X’s and O’s only when prices changebeyond a certain trigger point. P&F charts make congestion areas standout, helping traders find support and resistance and providing targets forreversals and profit taking. P&F charts are much older than bar charts.Professionals in the pits sometimes scribble them on the backs of theirtrading decks.72 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nChoosing a chart is a matter of personal choice. Pick the one that feels\nmost comfortable. I prefer bar charts but know many serious traders wholike P&F charts or candlestick charts.\nThe Reality of the Chart\nPrice ticks coalesce into bars, and bars into patterns, as the crowd writes itsemotional diary on the screen. Successful traders learn to recognize a fewpatterns and trade them. They wait for a familiar pattern to emerge like fisher-men wait for a nibble at a riverbank where they fished many times in the past.\nMany amateurs jump from one stock to another, but professionals tend\nto trade the same markets for years. They learn their intended catch’s per-sonality, its habits and quirks. When professionals see a short-term bottomin a familiar stock, they recognize a bargain and buy. Their buying checksthe decline and pushes the stock up. When prices rise, the pros reducetheir buying, but amateurs rush in, sucked in by the good news. Whenmarkets become overvalued, professionals start unloading their inventory.Their selling checks the rise and pushes the market down. Amateursbecome spooked and start dumping their holdings, accelerating thedecline. Once weak holders have been shaken out, prices slide to the levelwhere professionals see a bottom, and the cycle repeats.\nThat cycle is not mathematically perfect, which is why mechanical sys-\ntems tend not to work. Using technical indicators requires judgment. Beforewe review specific chart patterns, let us agree on the basic definitions:\nAnuptrend is a pattern in which most rallies reach a higher point than the\npreceding rally; most declines stop at a higher level than the precedingdecline.\nAdowntrend is a pattern in which most declines fall to a lower point than\nthe preceding decline; most rallies rise to a lower level than the pre-ceding rally.\nAnuptrendline is a line connecting two or more adjacent bottoms, slant-\ning upwards; if we draw a line parallel to it across the tops, we’ll havea trading channel.\nAdowntrendline is a line connecting two or more adjacent tops, slanting\ndown; one can draw a parallel line across the bottoms, marking a trad-ing channel.\nSupport is marked by a horizontal line connecting two or more adjacent\nbottoms. One can often draw a parallel line across the tops, marking atrading range.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 73\nResistance is marked by a horizontal line connecting two or more adjacent\ntops. One can often draw a parallel line below, across the bottoms, tomark a trading range.\nTops and Bottoms The tops of rallies mark the areas of the maximum\npower of bulls. They would love to lift prices even higher and make moremoney, but that’s where they get overpowered by bears. The bottoms ofdeclines, on the other hand, are the areas of maximum power of bears. Theywould love to push prices even lower and profit from short positions, butthey get overpowered by bulls. \nUse a computer or a ruler to draw a line, connecting nearby tops. If it\nslants up, it shows that bulls are becoming stronger, which is a goodthing to know if you plan to trade from the long side. If that line slantsdown, it shows that bulls are becoming weaker, and buying is not such agood idea.\nTrendlines applied to market bottoms help visualize changes in the\npower of bears. When a line connecting two nearby bottoms slants down,it shows that bears are growing stronger, and short selling is a goodoption. If that line slants up, however, it shows that bears are becomingweaker.\nWhen the lines connecting the tops and the lines connecting the bottoms\nare close to horizontal, the market is locked in a trading range. We can eitherwait for a breakout or trade short-term swings within that range.\nUptrendlines and Downtrendlines Prices often appear to travel along\ninvisible roads. When peaks rise higher at each successive rally, prices arein an uptrend. When bottoms keep falling lower and lower, prices are ina downtrend.\nWe can identify uptrends by drawing trendlines connecting the bottoms\nof declines. We use bottoms to identify an uptrend because the peaks ofrallies tend to be expansive, uneven affairs during uptrends. The declinestend to be more orderly, and when you connect them with a trendline,you get a truer picture of that uptrend.\nWe identify downtrends by drawing trendlines across the peaks of ral-\nlies. Each new low in a downtrend tends to be lower than the precedinglow, but the panic among weak holders can make bottoms irregularlysharp. Drawing a downtrendline across the tops of rallies paints a morecorrect picture of that downtrend.\nThe most important feature of a trendline is the direction of its slope.\nWhen it rises, the bulls are in control, and when it declines, the bears are74 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nin charge. The longer the trendline and the more points of contact it has\nwith prices, the more valid it is. The angle of a trendline reflects the emo-tional temperature of the crowd. Quiet, shallow trends can last a long time.As trends accelerate, trendlines have to be redrawn, making them steeper.When they rise or fall at 60° or more, their breaks tend to lead to majorreversals. This sometimes happens near the tail ends of runaway moves.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 75\nFigure 5.1 Trendlines; Kangaroo Tails\nDraw uptrendlines across the bottoms to mark uptrends. Draw downtrend-\nlines across the tops to mark downtrends. Notice that prices can briefly pen-etrate a trendline without breaking the trend. Observe that prices seem\nattached to their trendlines with rubber bands that extend only so far in any\ngiven trend. You want to establish positions in the direction of the slope of atrendline, entering reasonably close to it. By the time the trend reaches a newhigh or low, that swing away from the trendline is getting old—there is notmuch life left in the old dog. At the right edge of this chart the trend is down\nand the swing has fallen as far below its trendline as any since May. If you\nare short, it is time to start thinking of taking profits.\nNotice several bars that stick out of the tight weave of prices at the bot-\ntoms in May, November, and April, as well as the latest top in May. Those arekangaroo tails, which tend to mark turning points. The market tests a new\nhigh or a new low with a bar that is much taller than the preceding and fol-\nlowing bars, and then recoils from that price extreme. You can recognize atail during the bar that follows, and trade against it.\nYou can plot these lines using a ruler or a computer. It is better to\ndraw trendlines as well as support and resistance lines across the edges ofcongestion areas instead of price extremes. Congestion areas reflect crowdbehavior, while the extreme points show only the panic among the weak-est crowd members.\nTails—The Kangaroo Pattern Trends take a long time to form, but tails\nare created in just a few days. They provide valuable insights into marketpsychology, mark reversal areas, and point to trading opportunities.\nA tail is a one-day spike in the direction of a trend, followed by a reversal.\nIt takes a minimum of three bars to create a tail—relatively narrow bars inthe beginning and at the end, with an extremely wide bar in the middle.That middle bar is the tail, but you won’t know for sure until the follow-ing day, when a bar has sharply narrowed back at the base, letting the tailhang out. A tail sticks out from a tight weave of prices—you can’t miss it.\nA kangaroo, unlike a horse or a dog, propels itself by pushing with its\ntail. You can always tell which way a kangaroo is going to jump—oppositeits tail. When the tail points north, the kangaroo jumps south, and whenthe tail points south, it jumps north. Market tails tend to occur at turningpoints in the markets, which recoil from them like kangaroos recoil fromtheir tails. A tail does not forecast the extent of a move, but the first jumpusually lasts a few days, offering a trading opportunity. You can do well byrecognizing tails and trading against them.\nBefore you trade any pattern, you must understand what it tells you\nabout the market. Why do markets jump away from their tails?\nExchanges are owned by members who profit from volume rather than\ntrends. Markets fluctuate, looking for price levels that will bring the high-est volume of orders. Members do not know where those levels are, butthey keep probing higher and lower. A tail shows that the market hastested a certain price level and rejected it.\nIf a market stabs down and recoils, it shows that lower prices do not\nattract volume. The natural thing for the market to do next is rally and testhigher levels to see whether higher prices will bring more volume. If themarket stabs higher and recoils, leaving a tail pointing upward, it showsthat higher prices do not attract volume. The members are likely to sell themarket down in order to find whether lower prices will attract volume. Tailswork because the owners of the market are looking to maximize income.\nWhenever you see a very tall bar (several times the average for recent\nmonths) shooting in the direction of the existing trend, be alert to the pos-sibility of a tail. If the following day the market traces a very narrow bar76 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nat the base of the tall bar, it completes a tail. Be ready to put on a posi-\ntion, trading against that tail, before the close.\nWhen a market hangs down a tail, go long in the vicinity of the base of\nthat tail. Once long, place a protective stop approximately half-way down\nthe tail. If the market starts chewing its tail, run without delay. The targetsfor profit taking on these long positions are best established by using movingaverages and channels (see “Indicators—Five Bullets to a Clip,” page 84).\nWhen a market puts up a tail, go short in the area of the base of that tail.\nOnce short, place a protective stop approximately half-way up the tail. Ifthe market starts rallying up its tail, it is time to run; do not wait for theentire tail to be chewed up. Establish profit-taking targets using movingaverages and channels.\nYou can trade against tails in any timeframe. Daily charts are most com-\nmon, but you can also trade them on intraday or weekly charts. The mag-nitude of a move depends on its timeframe. A tail on a weekly chart willgenerate a much bigger move than a tail on a five-minute chart.\nSupport, Resistance, and False Breakouts When most traders and\ninvestors buy and sell, they make an emotional as well as a financial com-mitment to their trade. Their emotions can propel market trends or sendthem into reversals.\nThe longer a market trades at a certain level, the more people buy and\nsell. Suppose a stock falls from 80 and trades near 70 for several weeks,until many believe that it has found support and reached its bottom. Whathappens if heavy selling comes in and shoves that stock down to 60? Smartlongs will run fast, banging out at 69 or 68. Others will sit through theentire painful decline. If losers haven’t given up near 60 and are still alivewhen the market trades back towards 70, their pain will prompt them tojump at a chance to “get out even.” Their selling is likely to cap a rally, atleast temporarily. Their painful memories are the reason why the areasthat served as support on the way down become resistance on the wayup, and vice versa.\nRegret is another psychological force behind support and resistance. If\na stock trades at 80 for a while and then rallies to 95, those who did notbuy it near 80 feel as if they missed the train. If that stock sinks back near80, traders who regret a missed opportunity will return to buy in force.\nSupport and resistance can remain active for months or even years\nbecause investors have long memories. When prices return to their oldlevels, some jump at the opportunity to add to their positions while otherssee a chance to get out.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 77\nWhenever you work with a chart, draw support and resistance lines across\nrecent tops and bottoms. Expect a trend to slow down in those areas, anduse them to enter positions or take profits. Keep in mind that support andresistance are flexible—they are like a ranch wire fence rather than a glasswall. A glass wall is rigid and shatters when broken, but a herd of bulls canpush against a wire fence, shove their muzzles through it, and it will leanbut stand. Markets have many false breakouts below support and aboveresistance, with prices returning into their range after a brief violation.\nA false upside breakout occurs when the market rises above resistance\nand sucks in buyers before reversing and falling. A false downside break-out occurs when prices fall below support, attracting more bears just beforea rally. False breakouts provide professionals with some of the best tradingopportunities. They are similar to tails, only tails have a single wide bar,whereas false breakouts can have several bars, none of them especially tall.\nWhat causes false breakouts and how do you trade them? At the end of\na long rise the market hits resistance, stops, and starts churning. The pro-fessionals know there are many more buy orders above the resistancelevel. Some were placed by traders looking to buy a new breakout, andothers are protective stops placed by those who went short on the wayup. The pros are the first to know where people have stops because theyare the ones holding the orders.\nA false breakout occurs when the pros organize a fishing expedition to\nrun stops. For example, when a stock is slightly below its resistance at 60,the floor may start loading up on longs near 58.85. As sellers pull back, themarket roars above 60, setting off buy stops. The floor starts selling into thatrush, unloading longs as prices touch 60.50. When they see that public buyorders are drying up, they sell short and prices tank back below 60. That’swhen your charts show a false breakout above 60.\nS&P 500 futures are notorious for false breakouts. Day after day this\nmarket exceeds its previous day’s high or falls below its previous day’slow by a few ticks (a tick is the minimum price change permitted bythe exchange where an instrument is traded). This is one of the reasonsthe S&P is a difficult market to trade, but it attracts beginners like flies. Thefloor has a field day slapping them.\nSome of the best trading opportunities occur after false breakouts. When\nprices fall back into the range after a false upside breakout, you have extraconfidence to trade short. Use the top of the false breakout as your stop-loss point. Once prices rally back into their range after a false downsidebreakout, you have extra confidence to trade long. Use the bottom of thatfalse breakout for your stop-loss point.78 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nIf you have an open position, defend yourself against false breakouts\nby reducing your trading size and placing wider stops. Be ready to repo-sition if stopped out of your trade.\nThere are many advantages to risking just a small fraction of your\naccount on any trade. It allows you to be more flexible with stops. Whenthe volatility is high, consider protecting a long position by buying a putor a short position by buying a call. Finally, if you get stopped out on afalse breakout, don’t be shy about getting back into a trade. Beginnerstend to make a single stab at a position and stay out if they are stoppedout. Professionals, on the other hand, will attempt several entries beforenailing down the trade they want.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 79\nFigure 5.2 Support, Resistance, and False Breakouts\nIn September CIEN reached a peak below 140, then attacked that level in\nOctober and rallied above 150, only to sink below the old peak a few days\nlater. Some poor guy actually bought above 150—he really needed that stock!\nThe false upside breakout marked the end of the bull market.\nThe bear market established a bottom just near 65 in December, but in\nJanuary some desperate sellers dumped enough stock to briefly push CIENnear 60. At the right edge of the chart prices are rallying above the level oftheir old bottom. The bear trap has slammed shut, with a 50% rally in just\none month. Such signals are much easier to recognize using technical indi-\ncators, to be discussed later.\nDouble Tops and Bottoms Bulls make money when the market rises.\nThere are always a few who take profits on the way up, but new bullscome in and the rally continues. Every rally reaches a point where enoughbulls look at it and say—this is very nice, and it may get even nicer, butI’d rather have cash. Rallies top out after enough wealthy bulls take theirprofits, while the money from new bulls is not enough to replace whatwas taken out.\nWhen the market heads down from its peak, savvy bulls, the ones\nwho’ve cashed out early, are the most relaxed group. Other bulls who arestill long, especially if they came in late, feel trapped. Their profits aremelting away and turning into losses. Should they hold or sell?\nIf enough moneyed bulls decide the decline is being overdone, they’ll\nstep in and buy. As the rally resumes, more bulls come in. Now pricesapproach the level of their old top, and that’s where you can expect sellorders to hit the market. Many traders who got caught in the previousdecline swear to get out if the market gives them a second chance.\nAs the market rises toward its previous peak, the main question is\nwhether it will it rise to a new high or form a double top and turn down.Technical indicators can be of great help in answering this question. Whenthey rise to a new high, they tell you to hold, and when they form bear-80 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nFigure 5.3 Double Tops and Bottoms; Volume\nABC D\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 81\nish divergences (see “Indicators—Five Bullets to a Clip,” page 84), they tell\nyou to take profits at the second top.\nA mirror image of this situation occurs at market bottoms. The market\nfalls to a new low at which enough smart bears start covering shorts andthe market rallies. Once that rally peters out and prices start sinking again,all eyes are on the previous low—will it hold? If bears are strong and bullsskittish, prices will break below the first low, and the downtrend will con-tinue. If bears are weak and bulls are strong, the decline will stop in thevicinity of the old low, creating a double bottom. Technical indicators helpdecipher which of the two is more likely to happen.\nTriangles A triangle is a congestion area, a pause when winners take\nprofits and new trend followers get aboard, while their opponents tradeagainst the preceding trend. It is like a train station. The train stops to letpassengers off and pick up new ones, but there is always a chance this isthe last stop on the line and it may turn back.\nThe upper boundary of a triangle shows where sellers overpower buy-\ners and prevent the market from rising. The lower boundary shows where\nbuyers overpower sellers and prevent the market from falling. As the twostart to converge, you know a breakout is coming. As a general rule, theCallaway Golf (ELY) reached its high of 27.18 in March, at point A, and strug-\ngled again near that level, to 26.95 in April, at point B. A few days after it\nrecoiled from B, the double top became clearly visible. Many indicators\n(which we will review later) traced bearish divergences at that time.\nIn June the stock collapsed, as the aged founder of the company, the inven-\ntor of the famous Big Bertha golf club, became ill and died. In a fairly typicalemotional reaction, people dumped their stock without stopping to think\nwhether the demise of an individual would ruin a large, well-established com-\npany. Such declines feed on themselves, as lower prices scare more peopleinto selling. Notice a fantastic spike of volume, which reflected mass panic.The low at point C looks like a kangaroo tail, although not in its most classicalform. Prices rallied above 17 at point D in what is called “a dead cat bounce,”not out of any great bullishness but simply as a reaction to the decline.\nAt the right edge of the chart ELY is grinding down towards its recent bot-\ntom on low volume. If it recoils from that level, it’ll establish a double bottom.This is a fairly typical pattern—a crash, followed by a dead cat bounce, fol-lowed by a slow decline into the second bottom. Once prices rally from thesecond low, they are likely to usher in a sustainable rise.\ntrend that preceded the triangle deserves the benefit of the doubt. The\nangles between triangle walls reflect the balance of power between bullsand bears and hint at the likely direction of a breakout.\nAn ascending triangle has a flat upper boundary and a rising lower\nboundary. The flat upper line shows that bears have drawn a line in thesand and sell whenever the market comes to it. They must be a pretty82 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nFigure 5.4 Triangles, Pennants, and Rectangles\nCharts patterns are the footprints of bulls and bears. Patterns A and D are\ncalled pennants —a tight weave of prices that follows a sharp move up or\ndown its flagpole. When a pennant flies in the direction of the trend (A), it is\nusually followed by a sharp reversal. When it flies against the preceding trend\n(D), it is a consolidation pattern and the trend usually continues. Place yourentry orders accordingly, above or below a pennant’s boundary.\nPattern B is a symmetrical triangle and pattern C is an ascending triangle.\nBreakouts from triangles tend to follow the trends that preceded them, espe-\ncially when triangles are compact, consisting of only a few bars. Pattern E is\na rectangle; notice how bulls and bears push against the rectangle walls, cre-\nating brief false breakouts—do not jump in too early. When prices decisively\nbreak out of a rectangle, the reversal is complete.\nAt the right edge of the chart, prices are below a rectangle that provides\nsevere overhead resistance; the price is like a drowning man under an ice\nfloe. The trend is down, with rallies presenting shorting opportunities.\nA\nBCDE\npowerful group, calmly waiting for prices to come to them before unload-\ning. At the same time buyers are becoming more aggressive. They snap upmerchandise and keep raising the floor under the market.\nOn what party should you bet? Nobody knows who’ll win the election,\nbut savvy traders tend to place buy orders slightly above the upper line ofan ascending triangle. Since sellers are on the defensive, if the attackingbulls succeed, the breakout is likely to be steep. This is the logic of buy-ing upside breakouts from ascending triangles.\nA descending triangle has a flat lower boundary and a declining upper\nboundary. The horizontal lower line shows that bulls are pretty deter-mined, calmly waiting to buy at a certain level. At the same time, sellersare becoming more aggressive. They keep selling at lower and lower lev-els, pushing the market closer to the line drawn by buyers.\nAs a trader, which way will you bet—on the bulls or the bears? Expe-\nrienced traders tend to place their orders to sell short slightly below thelower line of a descending triangle. Let buyers defend that line, but if bullscollapse after a long defense, a break is likely to be sharp. This is the logicof shorting downside breakouts from descending triangles.\nA symmetrical triangle shows that both bulls and bears are equally con-\nfident. Bulls keep paying up, and bears keep selling lower. Neither groupis backing off, and their fight must be resolved before prices reach the tipof the triangle. The breakout is likely to go in the direction of the trendthat preceded the triangle.\nVolume Each unit of volume represents the actions of two individuals—\na buyer and a seller. It can be measured by several numbers: shares, con-tracts, or dollars that have changed hands. Volume is usually plotted as ahistogram below prices. It provides important clues about the actions ofbulls and bears. Rising volume tends to confirm trends, and falling volumebrings them into question.\nVolume reflects the level of pain among market participants. At each\ntick in every trade, one person is winning and the other losing. Marketscan move only if enough new losers enter the game to supply profits towinners. If the market is falling, it takes a very courageous or reckless bullto step in and buy, but without him there is no increase in volume. Whenthe trend is up, it takes a very brave or reckless bear to step in and sell.Rising volume shows that losers are continuing to come in, allowing thetrend to continue. When losers start abandoning the market, volume falls,and the trend runs out of steam. Volume gives traders several useful clues.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 83\nA one-day splash of uncommonly high volume often marks the begin-\nning of a trend when it accompanies a breakout from a trading range. Asimilar splash tends to mark the end of a trend if it occurs during a well-established move. Exceedingly high volume, three or more times above\naverage, identifies market hysteria. That is when nervous bulls finallydecide that the uptrend is for real and rush in to buy or nervous bearsbecome convinced that the decline has no bottom and jump in to sell short.\nDivergences between price and volume tend to occur at turning points.\nWhen prices rise to a new high but volume shrinks, it shows that theuptrend attracts less interest. When prices fall to a new low and volumefalls, it shows that lower prices attract little interest and an upside reversalis likely. Price is more important than volume, but good traders alwaysanalyze volume to gauge the degree of crowd involvement. For a moreobjective rating of volume use an indicator called Force Index (see nextsection). Changes in volume detected by Force Index give important mes-sages to traders.\nINDICATORS —FIVEBULLETS TO A CLIP\nI had a friend who drove a tank in World War ll, fighting his way fromStalingrad to Vienna. He maintained his tank with only three tools—a bighammer, a big screwdriver, and the Russian version of “f... you.” He wonthe war with a few simple tools, and we can apply his lessons to the dan-gerous environment of the markets.\nAn amateur tries to grab a bit of money here and there. He uses one\ntechnique today and another tomorrow. His mind is scattered and he keepslosing, enriching only his broker and floor traders. A new hunter walks intothe woods with a load of fancy gear on his back but soon discovers thatmost of it only slows him down. An experienced woodsman travels light.\nA beginner shoots at anything that moves, including his own shadow.\nAn old hunter knows exactly what prey he is after and brings only a fewbullets. Simplicity and discipline go hand in hand. To be a successfultrader, choose a small number of markets, select a few tools, and learn touse them well. If you follow five stocks, your research will be deeper andresults better than if you follow 50. If you use five indicators, you’ll getmore mileage out of them than out of 25. You can always expand later,once you make steady profits.\nThe indicators we are about to discuss represent the choice of one\ntrader. I call this approach “five bullets to a clip.” An old army rifle used totake five bullets, and I analyze markets using no more than five indicators.84 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nIf five do not help, 10 will not do any better because there probably is no\ntrade. I offer you this list as a starting point for selecting your own bullets.Pay attention to the general principle of selecting indicators from differentgroups to focus on different aspects of crowd behavior. The key idea is toselect a few core tools that fit your style of analysis and trading.\nThe tools we are about to review—moving averages, envelopes, MACD,\nMACD-Histogram, and Force Index—are the building blocks of a trading sys-tem described in the following chapter. There is no magic indicator; they allhave advantages and disadvantages. It is important to be aware of bothbecause then we can combine several indicators into a system to take advan-tage of their strengths, while their disadvantages cancel each other out.\nChoice of Tools\nMarkets can confound traders. They often run in two directions at once—up on the weekly charts and down on the dailies. A market can reversewithout sending you an e-mail about its change of plans. A sleepy stockcan get so hot that it burns through stops, while a formerly hot stockbecomes so cold it freezes your capital along with your fingers.\nTrading is a complex, nontrivial game. Markets consist of huge crowds\nof people, and technical analysis is applied social psychology. We mustselect several tools to identify different aspects of market behavior. Beforeusing any indicator, we must understand how it is constructed and what itmeasures. We must test it on historical data and learn how it performsunder different conditions. Once you start testing an indicator, expect toadjust its settings, turning it into a personal trading tool as reliable andfamiliar as an old wrench.\nToolboxes vs. Black Boxes I keep seeing ads in traders’ magazines that\nshow computers with $100 bills coming out of their disk drives. I’d love toget a hold of one of those models. The only ones I could find have the direc-tion of money reversed. Computers can chew up cash, but pulling it out ofthem takes a lot of hard work. Those ads sell black boxes—computerizedtrading systems. Some clown has programmed a bunch of trading rules, putthem on a copy-protected diskette or a CD, and now sells you a tool with agreat track record. Feed it market data, and it will spit out an answer—whento buy or sell! If you believe this magic, wait until you meet Santa Claus.\nA fantastic track record of a canned system is meaningless because it\ncomes from fitting the rules to old data. Any computer can tell you whichrules worked in the past. Black-box programs self-destruct as soon as theMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 85\nmarkets change, even if they include self-optimization. Black boxes appeal\nto beginners who derive a false sense of security from them.\nA good software package is a toolbox—a collection of tools for analyz-\ning markets and making your own decisions. A toolbox can downloaddata, draw charts, and plot indicators, as well as any trading signals youcare to program. It provides charting and analytic tools but leaves you tomake your own trading decisions.\nThe heart of any toolbox is its collection of indicators—tools for iden-\ntifying trends and reversals behind the noise of raw data. Good toolboxesallow you to modify indicators and even design your own. Indicators areobjective; you may argue about the trend, but when an indicator is up, it’sup, and when it is down, it’s down. Keep in mind that indicators arederived from prices. The more complicated they are, the farther they arefrom prices and the farther away from reality. Prices are primary, indica-tors are secondary, and simple indicators work best.\nTrend-Following Indicators and Oscillators Learning to use indicators\nis like learning a foreign language. You have to immerse yourself in them,make typical beginners’ mistakes, and keep practicing until you rise to thelevel of proficiency and competence.\nGood technical indicators are simple tools that perform well when\nmarket conditions change. They are robust, that is, relatively immune toparameter changes. If an indicator gives great signals using a 17-day win-dow but bombs when you try a 15-day window, then it’s probably use-less. Good indicators give useful signals at a broad range of settings.\nWe can divide all technical indicators into three major groups: trend-fol-\nlowing, oscillators, and miscellaneous. Whenever we use an indicator, wemust know to which group it belongs. Each group has its advantages anddisadvantages.\nTrend-following indicators include moving averages, MACD (moving\naverage convergence-divergence), Directional System, and others. Big trends\nmean big money, and these indicators help us stay long in uptrends andshort in downtrends. They have built-in inertia that allows them to lockonto a trend and ride it. That same inertia causes them to lag at turningpoints. Their advantages and disadvantages are the flip sides of each other,and you cannot have one without the other.\nOscillators include Force Index, Rate of Change, and Stochastic, among\nothers. They help catch turning points by showing when markets are\noverbought (too high and ready to fall) or oversold (too low and ready to86 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nrise). Oscillators work great in trading ranges, where they catch upturns\nand downturns. Taking their signals when prices are relatively flat is likegoing to a cash machine—you always get something, although not verymuch. Their downside is that they give premature sell signals in uptrendsand buy signals in downtrends.\nMiscellaneous indicators, such as Bullish Consensus, Commitments of\nTraders, and New High–New Low Index, gauge the current mood of themarket. They show whether the overall bullishness or bearishness is ris-\ning or falling.\nIndicators from different groups often contradict one another. For example,\nwhen markets rise, trend-following indicators turn up, telling us to buy. At thesame time, oscillators become overbought and start flashing sell signals. Theopposite occurs in downtrends, when trend-following indicators turn down,giving sell signals, while oscillators become oversold, flashing buy signals.Which should we follow? The answers are easy in the middle of a chart, butmuch harder at the right edge, where we must make our trading decisions.\nSome beginners close their eyes to complexity, choose a single indi-\ncator, and stick to it until the market whacks them from an unexpecteddirection. Others create a homemade opinion poll; they take a battery ofindicators and average their signals. This is a meaningless exercise be-cause its outcome depends on what indicators you include in your poll;change the selection and you’ll change the outcome. The Triple Screentrading system, described below, overcomes the problem of conflictingindicators by linking them with different timeframes.\nTime—The Factor of Five A computer screen can comfortably show\nabout 120 bars in an open-high-low-close format. What if you display amonthly chart, each of whose bars represents one month? You’ll see 10years worth of history at a glance, your stock’s big picture. You can displaya weekly chart and review its rallies and declines for the past two years. Adaily chart will show you the action for the past few months. How aboutan hourly chart, each of whose bars represents one hour of trading? It willlet you zoom in on the past few days and pick up short-term trends. Wantto get even closer? How about a 10-minute chart, each of whose bars rep-resents 10 minutes of market action?\nLooking at all these charts, you quickly notice that markets can move in\ndifferent directions at the same time. You may see an upmove on theweekly chart, while the dailies are breaking down. An hourly chart may besagging, while a 10-minute chart is rallying. Which trend to follow?METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 87\nMost beginners look at only one timeframe, usually daily. The trouble is\nthat a new trend, erupting from another timeframe, often hurts traders whodo not look beyond their noses. Another serious problem is that looking atthe daily chart puts you on par with thousands of other traders who alsolook at it. What’s your advantage, what’s your edge?\nMarkets are so complex that we must always analyze them in more than\none timeframe. The Factor of Five, first described in Trading for a Living ,\nlinks all timeframes. Every timeframe is related to the next higher and thenext lower by the factor of five. There are almost five (4.3 to be exact) weeksto a month, five days to a week, and close to five hours in many trading days.We can break an hour into 10-minute segments and those into 2-minute bars.\nThe key principle of Triple Screen, which we will review later, is to\nchoose your favorite timeframe and then immediately go up to the time-frame one order of magnitude higher. There we make a strategic decisionto go long or short. We return to our favorite timeframe to make tacticaldecisions about where to enter, exit, place a profit target and a stop.Adding the dimension of time to our analysis gives us an edge over thecompetition.\nUse at least two, but not more than three, timeframes because adding more\nonly clutters up the decision-making process. If you are day-trading with30- and five-minute charts, then a weekly chart is essentially irrelevant. If you\nare trading market swings using a weekly and a daily, then the wiggles of afive-minute chart are no more than noise. Choose your favorite timeframe,add the timeframe one order of magnitude higher, and start your analysis atthat point.\nMoving Averages\nMoving averages (MAs) are among the oldest, simplest, and most usefultools for traders. They help identify trends and find areas for enteringtrades. We plot them as lines on price charts, each of whose points reflectsthe latest average price.\nWhat is the reality behind the moving averages, and what do they measure?\nEach price is a momentary consensus of value among market partici-\npants, a snapshot of the market crowd at the moment of a trade. What ifyou show me a snapshot of your friend and ask whether he is an optimistor a pessimist, a bull or a bear? It is hard to tell from a single photo. If youtake his snapshot from the same position for 10 days in a row and bringthem to a lab, you can get a composite photo. When 10 pictures are super-88 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nimposed upon one another, the typical features stand out, while the atypi-\ncal fade away. If you start updating that composite each day, you’ll have amoving average of your friend’s mood. If you lay a string of compositephotos side by side, it will be clear whether your friend is becoming hap-pier or sadder.\nA moving average is a composite photograph of the market. It adds\nnew prices as they occur and drops old ones. A rising moving averageshows that the crowd is becoming more optimistic—bullish. A fallingmoving average shows that the crowd is becoming more pessimistic—bearish.\nA moving average responds not only to the data but to how we con-\nstruct it. We must make several decisions to help separate the message ofour moving average from the construction noise. First, we need to decidewhat data we’ll use. We need to select the width of our time window—wider for catching longer trends, narrower for catching minor ones.Finally, we need to choose the type of moving average.\nWhat Data to Average? Traders who rely on daily and weekly charts\nusually apply moving averages to closing prices. This makes sense,because they reflect the final consensus of value, the most important priceof the day.\nThe closing price of a five-minute or an hourly bar has no such special\nmeaning. Day-traders are better off averaging not closing prices, but anaverage price of each bar. For example, they can average Open +High +\nLow +Close of each bar, divided by four, or High +Low +Close divided\nby three.\nWe can apply moving averages to indicators, such as Force Index (see\nbelow). A raw Force Index reflects price changes and volume for the day.Averaging produces a smoother plot and reveals a longer-term trend ofForce Index.\nHow Long a Moving Average? Moving averages help identify trends. A\nrising MA encourages you to maintain longs, whereas a falling MA tellsyou to hold shorts. The wider the time window, the smoother is a movingaverage. That benefit has a cost. The longer a moving average, the slowerit responds to trend changes. The shorter a moving average, the better ittracks prices, but the more subject it is to whipsaws, temporary deviationsfrom the main trend. If you make your moving average very long, it willmiss important reversals by a wide margin. Shorter MAs are more sensitiveMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 89\nto trend changes, but those shorter than 10 bars defeat the purpose of a\ntrend-following tool.\nAt the time I wrote Trading for a Living , I was using 13-bar MAs, but in\nrecent years I switched to longer moving averages to catch more importanttrends and avoid whipsaws. To analyze weekly charts, start with a 26-weekmoving average, representing half a year’s worth of data. Try to shorten thatnumber and see whether you can do it without sacrificing the smoothnessof your MA. On the daily charts, start with a 22-day MA, reflecting roughlythe number of trading days in a month, and see whether you can make itshorter. Whatever length you decide to use, be sure to test it on your owndata. If you track just a handful of markets, you’ll have enough time to trydifferent lengths of moving averages until you get smoothly flowing lines.\nThe width of any indicator time window is best expressed in bars rather\nthan days. The computer doesn’t know whether you are analyzing daily,monthly, or hourly charts; it sees only bars. Whatever we say about a dailyMA applies to the weekly or the monthly. It’s better to call it a 22-bar MArather than a 22-day MA.\nMathematically savvy traders can look into using adaptive moving aver-\nages whose length changes in response to market conditions, as advo-cated by John Ehlers, Tushar Chande, and Perry Kaufman. Ehlers’ latestbook, Rocket Science for Traders, delves into adapting all indicators to cur-\nrent market conditions.\nWhat Type of Moving Average? A simple MA adds up prices in its time\nwindow and divides the sum by the width of that window. For example, fora 10-day simple MA of closing prices, add up closing prices for the past 10days and divide the sum by 10. The trouble with a simple MA is that eachprice affects it twice—when it comes in and when it drops out. A high newvalue pushes up the moving average, giving a buy signal. This is good; wewant our MAs to respond to new prices. The trouble is that 10 days later,when that high number drops from the window, the MA also drops, givinga sell signal. This is ridiculous because if we shorten a simple MA by oneday, we’ll get that sell signal a day sooner, and if we lengthen it by a day,we’ll get it a day later. We can engineer our own signals by fiddling with thelength of a simple MA!\nAn exponential moving average (EMA) overcomes this problem. It re-\nacts only to incoming prices, to which it assigns more weight. It does notdrop old prices from its time window, but slowly squeezes them out withthe passage of time.90 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nEMA =Ptoday•K+EMAyesterday•(1− K)\nN =the number of days in the EMA (selected by trader)\nPtoday=today’s price\nEMAyesterday =the EMA of yesterday\nFew people calculate indicators by hand these days—computers do it\nfaster and more accurately. If we decide to look at a 22-bar EMA of clos-ing prices, K =2/(22+ 1)=2/23 =0.087. Multiply the latest closing price by\nthat figure, multiply yesterday’s EMA by 0.913 (i.e., 1 − 0.087 ), add the two,\nand arrive at today’s EMA. Traders sometimes ask where to get an EMA inthe beginning. Begin by calculating a 22-bar simple MA and then switch tothe EMA. Most indicators require you to have one or two months of databefore they start giving meaningful signals.\nTrading Signals The most important message of a moving average is the\ndirection of its slope. When the EMA rises, it shows that the crowd is be-coming more optimistic and bullish, which is a good time to be long. Whenit falls, it shows that the crowd is becoming more pessimistic and bearish. Itis a good time to be short.\nWhen a moving average points up, trade that market from the long side.\nWhen a moving average points down, trade that market from the short side. As\na trader, you have three options: go long, go short, or stand aside. A movingaverage takes away one of those. When it points up, it prohibits you fromshorting and tells you to go long or stand aside. When it points down, it pro-hibits you from buying and tells you to look only for shorts or stay out. Whenan EMA starts jerking up and down, it indicates a vacillating, trendless mar-ket; it is better to stop using trend-following methods. Continue to monitorthe EMA, but take its signals at a discount until a new trend emerges.\nThe only time when it is OK to override the message of a moving aver-\nage is when trying to pick a bottom after a bullish divergence betweenMACD-Histogram (described below) and price. If you do that, be sure touse tight stops. If you succeed, bank your profits but do not think that therules of the game have changed. A trader who thinks he is above the rulesbecomes careless and loses money.\nEnter long positions in the vicinity of a rising MA. Enter short positions in\nthe vicinity of a falling MA. Use MA to differentiate between “value trades” andwhereN K =+2\n1METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 91\n92 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nFigure 5.5 Moving Average—Major Trend\nAn exponential moving average is slow but steady, like a directional\nindicator on a steamroller. EMA works in all timeframes but shines on\nthe weeklies, where it helps you stay with the major trend no matter\nhow hard it tries to shake you off. Trading in the direction of a weeklymoving average should help you get ahead of many traders. You can posi-\ntion yourself in the direction of the EMA and hold, or else trade in and out,\nusing daily charts.\nThis 26-week EMA has tracked the entire glorious bull market in YHOO,\nfrom its obscure beginnings, to the breathtaking $250 peak, and back into the\ndoghouse. If you wake up in the morning, look at the weekly EMA, and trade\nin its direction, you will not be in too bad a shape!\nThere are no perfect indicators, and an EMA has its share of diffi-\nculties when markets go flat. When the EMA starts to quiver, as it did in\n1999, it is time to stand aside or trade short term, not counting on a\nmajor trend.\nNotice the three tails in YHOO (and the fourth, not as pure as the first\nthree). Every time there was a tail, the price got halved within weeks.\nAt the right edge of the chart prices are flat and EMA is declining. Prices\nare closer to the bottom than they are to the top, but there is no rush\nto buy. Let the EMA flatten out and tick up before positioning for a new\nmajor bull move.\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 93\n“greater fool theory trades.” Most uptrends are punctuated by declines, when\nprices return to the EMA. When we buy near the moving average, we buyvalue and can place a tight stop slightly below the EMA. If the rally resumes,we’ll make money, but if the market turns against us, the loss will be small.Buying near the EMA helps maximize gains and minimize risks.\nFigure 5.6 Value Trades and Greater Fool Theory Trades\nWhen you buy near a rising moving average, you buy value (points D and F).\nWaiting for such opportunities requires patience, but it is infinitely safer thanchasing rallies. Those who buy high above the EMA pay above value, hoping\nto meet a greater fool who will pay them even more. Anxious traders who\nbuy near the tops (points C and E) get shaken out, or else they tensely waitto get out at breakeven.\nMany stocks and futures have typical behavior patterns, and you should\ntry to identify them and use them. At the time of this writing, EBAY likes to\nhave kangaroo tails (A, B, C, and E). The C tail had the most classical shape,\nbut others worked also. Knowing what pattern to expect helps you recognize\nit a little sooner when it appears.\nAt the right edge of the chart the EMA has stopped rising and begun to flut-\nter. The bull move is over. If you are a trend trader, it is time to move over to\nother, trending stocks. Keep an eye on EBAY, waiting for a new trend to emerge.\nA\nBCE\nF\nD\nValueValue\nIf we buy high above the EMA, our actions say, “I am a fool, I am over-\npaying, but I hope to meet a greater fool down the road who’ll pay meeven more.” Betting on the greater fool theory is a poor idea. There arevery few fools in the markets. Financial markets do not attract foolish peo-ple, and counting on them is a losing proposition.\nThere are times when wild rallies in high-flying stocks seem to vindi-\ncate the greater fool theory. Stocks with no assets or earnings can fly onhot air. A value trader who feels he is missing those spectacular moveshas a choice. He can stick to his method, soberly saying, “Can’t catchthem all.” Or he may decide, “When living with the wolves, howl like awolf” and start buying upside breakouts. If you do that, remember, youare now engaged in greater fool theory trading and the only asset sepa-rating you from the manic crowd is your risk control—your stops andmoney management.\nThe same rules apply to shorting in downtrends. When you go short on\na rally to the EMA, you are selling value—before the market reverses andstarts destroying value again. A greater fool theorist shorts far below theEMA—the farther away, the greater the fool.\nUse a system of dual moving averages to identify trends and enter posi-\ntions. You may select an EMA that tracks your market well, but it moves\nso explosively that prices never react back to that EMA, denying you achance to put on a value trade. To solve this problem, you can add a sec-ond moving average. Use the longer EMA to indicate the trend, and theshorter to find entry points.\nSuppose you find that a 22-day EMA does a good job identifying trends\nin your market. Plot it, but then divide its length in half and plot an 11-dayEMA on the same screen in a different color. Continue to use the 22-day EMAto identify bull and bear moves, but use pullbacks to the shorter EMA toidentify entry points.\nMoving averages help identify trends and decide whether to trade long\nor short. They help mark value areas for entering trades. To find exit points,we turn to our next tool, channels on moving averages.\nChannels\nMarkets are manic-depressive beasts. They rise in powerful rallies, onlyto collapse in breathtaking declines. A stock catches the public’s fancy,shoots up 20 points one day, and then slides 24 points down the next.What drives those moves? Fundamental values change slowly, but wavesof greed, fear, optimism, and despair drive prices up and down.94 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nHow can you tell when a market has reached an undervalued or over-\nvalued level, a zone for buying or selling? Market technicians can usechannels to find those levels. A channel, or an envelope, consists of twolines, one above and one below a moving average. There are two maintypes of channels: straight envelopes and standard deviation channels,also known as Bollinger bands.\nIn Bollinger bands the spread between the upper and lower lines keeps\nchanging in response to volatility. When volatility rises, Bollinger bandsspread wide, but when markets become sleepy, those bands start squeez-ing the moving average. This feature makes them useful for options traderssince volatility drives options prices. In a nutshell, when Bollinger bandsbecome narrow, volatility is low, and options should be bought. When theyswing far apart, volatility is high, and options should be sold or written.\nTraders of stocks and futures are better off with straight channels or\nenvelopes. They keep a steady distance from a moving average, provid-ing steadier price targets. Draw both lines a certain percentage above orbelow the EMA. If you use dual moving averages, draw channel lines par-allel to the longer one.\nA moving average reflects the average consensus of value, but what is\nthe meaning of a channel? \nThe upper channel line reflects the power of\nbulls to push prices above the average consensus of value. It marks thenormal limit of market optimism. The lower channel line reflects the powerof bears to push prices below the average consensus of value. It marks thenormal limit of market pessimism. A well-drawn channel helps diagnosemania and depression. \nMost software programs draw channels according\nto this formula:\nUpper channel line =EMA +EMA •Channel coefficient\nLower channel line =EMA − EMA •Channel coefficient\nA well-drawn channel contains the bulk of prices, with only a few\nextremes poking out. Adjust the coefficient until the channel containsapproximately 95 percent of all prices for the past several months. Mathe-maticians call this the second standard deviation channel . Most software\npackages make this adjustment very easy.\nFind proper channel coefficients for any market by trial and error. Keep\nadjusting them until the channel holds approximately 95% of all data, withonly the highest tops and the lowest bottoms sticking out. Drawing a chan-nel is like trying on a shirt. Choose the size in which the entire body fits com-fortably, with only the wrists and the neck poking out.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 95\nDifferent trading vehicles and timeframes require different channel\nwidths. Volatile markets require wider channels and higher coefficients.The longer the timeframe, the wider the channel; weekly channels tend tobe twice as wide as dailies. Stocks tend to require wider channels thanfutures. A good time to review and adjust channels in futures is when anold contract nears expiration and you switch to the new front month.\nA channel drawn in an uptrend tends to fit the peaks. Rallies in a bull\nmarket are much stronger than declines, and bottoms seldom reach thelower channel line. In a downtrend, a channel tends to track bottoms,while the tops are too limp to rise to the upper channel line. It is unnec-essary to draw two separate channels, one for the tops and the other forthe bottoms; just follow the dominant crowd. In a flat market expect bothtops and bottoms to touch their channel lines.\nWhen we are bullish, we want to buy value near the rising EMA and take\nprofits when the market becomes overvalued—at or above the upper chan-nel line. When bearish, we want to go short near the falling EMA and coverwhen the market becomes undervalued—at or below the lower channel line.96 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nBEGIK\nJ\nH\nF\nDC\nA\nFigure 5.7 Channels for Profit Taking\nWhen the EMA rises, it identifies an uptrend. It is a good idea to buy near that\nEMA or slightly higher or lower, depending on the stock’s recent behavior.At point A, EMA stands at 35, while the low point of the bar reaches 33—a\nIf you buy near a rising moving average, take profits in the vicinity of\nthe upper channel line. If you sell short near a falling moving average,cover in the vicinity of the lower channel line. Channels catch swings\nabove and below value but not major trends. Those swings can be veryrewarding. If you can catch a move from the EMA to the channel line inbond futures, you’ll make about $2,000 in profit on a $2,000 margin. Ifyou can do this a few times a year, you’ll find yourself far ahead of manyprofessionals.\nA beginner who sells his position near the upper channel line may\nregret it several weeks later. In a bull market, what looks overvalued todaymay look like a bargain the next month. Professionals do not let such feel-ings bother them. They are trading, not investing. They know it’s easy tobe smart looking at old charts, but hard to make decisions at the rightedge. They have a system, and they follow it.\nWhen prices blow out of a channel but then return to the moving aver-\nage, trade in the direction of the slope of that MA, with a profit target nearthe channel line. Prices break out of channels only during the strongest\ntrends. After they pull back, they often retest the extremes of those break-METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 97\n2-point downside penetration. At point C, the price low penetrates the EMA\nby 1 point, at D by 2.25, at F by 4, at point H by 0.75, and at J by 4. Those\nshort-term bottoms keep alternating between shallow and deep—an impor-\ntant piece of intelligence when you try to decide where to place your buy\norder. If the latest penetration was shallow, expect the next one to be deep,and vice versa, and place your buy orders accordingly.\nThe place to sell stocks purchased near the EMA is at the upper channel\nline. Looking back, it is easy to see that buy-and-hold would have workedeven better in TARO, but the future is not nearly as clear at the right edge ofthe chart. Buying value near the EMA and taking profits above value, near theupper channel line, is safer and more reliable. Stock bought at A can be soldat B, bought again at C or D and sold at E, and so on.\nA trader can grade his performance, based on the percentage of the chan-\nnel he takes in profits on any given trade. For example, at the right edge ofthe chart, the upper channel line stands at 97 and the lower at 69, makingthe channel 28 points high. An A trader should get the minimum of 30% or8.4 points out of the next trade, a B trader 20% or 5.6 points, and a C trader\n10% or 2.8 points.\nAt the right edge of the chart, prices are hitting the upper channel line. It\nis time to take profits on stocks purchased in area J, near the EMA, and waitfor a pullback.\nouts. A breakout from a channel gives us confidence to trade again in its\ndirection.\nPrices occasionally take off on wild runaway trends. They break out of a\nchannel and stay out for a long time, without pulling back to their EMA.When you recognize such a powerful move, you have a choice: stand asideor switch to a system for trading impulse moves. Professional traders, oncethey find a technique that works for them, tend to stay with it. They’d rathermiss a trade than change to an unfamiliar style.\nIf a moving average is essentially flat, go long at the lower channel line,\nsell short at the upper channel line, and take profits when prices return totheir moving average. The upper channel line marks an overbought zone.\nIf the market is relatively flat on long-term charts, rallies to the upperchannel line then provide shorting opportunities, whereas declines tothe lower channel line provide buying opportunities. Professionals tendto trade against deviations and for the return to normalcy. Amateurs thinkthat every breakout will be followed by a massive runaway move. Oncein a rare while the amateurs are right, but in the long run it pays to betlike the pros. They use channels to find when the market has outrun itselfand where it is likely to reverse.\nHow to Grade Your Performance Imagine two friends taking a college\ncourse. Both have similar abilities and backgrounds, but one takes a testeach week, while the other waits for a final. All other factors being equal,which of them is likely to get a higher grade on the exam? The one whowaited or the one who took weekly tests?\nMost educational systems test students at regular intervals. Testing\nprompts people to fill the gaps in their knowledge. Students who taketests throughout the year tend to do better on their finals. Frequent testshelp improve performance.\nMarkets keep testing us, only most traders don’t bother to look up their\ngrades. They gloat over profits or trash confirmation slips for losing trades.Neither bragging nor beating yourself makes you a better trader.\nThe market grades every trade and posts results on a wall, only most\ntraders have no clue where to look. Some count money, but that’s a verycrude measure, which does not compare performance in different marketsat different prices. You may take more money from a sloppy trade in a bigexpensive market than from an elegant entry and exit in a difficult narrowmarket. Which of them reveals a higher level of skill? Money is importantbut it doesn’t always provide the best measure of success.98 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 99\nChannels help us grade the quality of our trades.\nWhen you enter a trade, measure the height of the channel from the\nupper to the lower line. If you use daily charts to find trades, measure thedaily channel; if you use a 10-minute chart, measure the channel on a 10-minute chart; and so on. When you exit that trade, calculate the numberof points you’ve taken as a percentage of the channel. That is your per-formance grade.\nIf a stock is trading at 80 with a 10% channel, then the upper channel line\nis at 88 and the lower at 72. Suppose you buy that stock at 80 and sell it at84. If you take 4 points out of the 16-point channel, then your grade is \n4⁄16\nor 25%. Where does that place you on the rating curve?\nAny trade where you take 30% or more out of a channel earns you an\nA. If you take between 20 and 30%, your grade is a solid B. If you grabbetween 10 and 20%, you earn a C. You get a D by taking less than 10%out of a channel or running a loss.\nGood traders keep good records. Your first essential record is a spread-\nsheet of all your trades (we’ll review this in Chapter 8, “The OrganizedTrader”). Add two columns to your spreadsheet. Use the first to record theheight of the channel when you enter the trade. Use the second to calculatewhat percentage of that channel you’ve grabbed exiting that trade. Keep mon-itoring your grades to see whether your performance is improving or deteri-orating, steady or erratic. Back in college, professors used to grade you. Nowyou can use channels to find out your grades and become a better trader.\nWhat Markets to Trade? Channels can help us decide which stocks or\nfutures to trade and which to leave alone. A stock may have great funda-mentals or beautiful technical signals, but measure its channel before youput on a trade. It’ll show you whether the swings are wide enough to beworth trading.\nYou may look at a volatile stock whose channel height is 30 points. If\nyou are an A trader, you should be able to get 30%, or 9 points, out of atrade. That will be more than enough to pay commissions, cover slippage,and leave you with profits. On the other hand, if you look at an inexpen-sive stock whose channel is only 5 points high, then an A trader would beshooting for a paltry 1.5-point gain. That would leave you with next tonothing after commissions and slippage—leave that stock alone, no mat-ter how good it looks.\nWhat if your performance slips a bit or the market throws you a curve?\nWhat if you earn only a C and take only 10% out of a channel? The first\nstock, with its 30-point channel, will return 3 points profit—enough to make\nsome money after expenses. The stock with a 5-point channel will returnonly half a point, and commissions and slippage may push you into nega-tive territory! Beginners are often seduced by low-priced stocks with strongtechnical patterns. They cannot understand why they keep losing money.When there is no room for the stock to swing, a trader can’t win.\nA good technical analyst who was slowly losing money called me for\na consultation. When I asked him to fax me his charts, he showed $10and $15 stocks whose channels were only $2 to $4 tall. There was simplyno room for price swings, while commissions, slippage, and expensescontinued to chip away at his equity. If you’re going to support yourselfby fishing, find a channel where the fish are big enough.\nOnce you become interested in a new stock, draw a channel to see\nwhether it’s wide enough to trade. We like to think of ourselves as A tradersand all-around A people, but what if you pull only a C trade? If you takeonly 10 percent out of this channel, will it be worth trading? Beginningtraders should leave alone any stock whose channel is narrower than 10points, meaning that a C trader can take one point out of it.\nA few traders said to me it was OK to trade stocks with narrrow chan-\nnels, as long as one increased trading size. They think that trading 10,000shares in a three-point channel is the same as trading 1,000 shares in a30-point channel, but it is not, because the ratio of slippage to channel ismuch higher in narrow channels, raising the external barrier to victory.\nLow-priced stocks with slender channels can make good investments.\nThink of Peter Lynch, a famous money manager, looking for his elusive10-bagger, a stock that goes up 10-fold. A $5 stock is much more likely torise to $50 than an $80 stock to rally to $800. But those are investments,not trades. As a trader, you are looking to take advantage of short-termswings. That is why you should not waste your energy on any stock whosechannel is narrow.\nThe Rewards of Day-Trading Day-trading seems deceptively easy, and\nbeginners flock to it like moths to a flame. Amateurs look at intraday chartsand see strong rallies and steep declines. It looks like the money is therefor the picking by any sharp-witted individual with a computer, a modem,and a live data feed. Day-trading firms make fortunes in commissions. Theypromote day-trading because they need to replace the great majority of cus-tomers who flame out. The firms hide customer statistics from the public,but in the year 2000 state regulators in Massachusetts subpoenaed recordswhich showed that after 6 months only 16% of day-traders made money.100 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThere is an old Russian saying: “your elbow is near, yet you can’t bite\nit.” Try it now—stretch your neck, bend your arm, go for it. So near, yetso far. It’s the same with day-trading—the money is right in front of yourface, yet you keep missing it by a few ticks. Why do so many people loseso much money day-trading? There is simply not enough height in intra-day channels to make profits. Using channels to select trades sends apowerful message to day-traders.\nLook at a few popular actively traded stocks—YHOO, AMZN, and AOL\nare in the forefront of public attention on the day I write this. The figures arelikely to change by the time you read this book, but today I get the follow-ing numbers for channel heights on their daily and five-minute charts:\nA-level C-level Five- A-level C-level\nDaily trader trader minute trader trader\nchannel (30%) (10%) channel (30%) (10%)\nAOL 20 6 2 3 0.9 0.3\nAMZN 21 6.3 2.1 3 0.9 0.3\nYHOO 54 16.2 5.4 7 2.1 0.7\nA swing trader who uses daily charts to buy and hold for a few days can do\nvery well in these active stocks. He can really clean up if he is an A-leveltrader, but even if he is a C trader, taking 10% out of a channel, he can stayafloat while he’s learning. A person who day-trades the same stocks mustbe a straight-A trader in order to survive. Anything less, and he’ll be eatenalive by slippage, commissions, and expenses.\nI can hear a howl of protests from the crowd of vendors who make a\ngood living from day-trading—brokers, software dealers, system sellers,etc. They can roll out their examples of successful day-traders, as if thatproves anything! Brilliant day-traders do exist, and I am friends with ahandful of them myself. Sadly, it’s a very small handful.\nThe chances of becoming a successful day-trader are very low because\nthe channels on intraday charts are not high enough. You must be astraight-A trader to make money out of those minute swings. The slightestdistraction, a bit of market noise, a slight slip of performance, and anotherday-trader bites the dust.\nDay-trading provides fantastic entertainment value. Recreational ath-\nletes expect to pay for their sport rather than make money from it.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 101\nRecreational day-traders who expect to make money are deluding them-\nselves into believing that they will reach their elbow with their teeth.Maybe tomorrow ....\nMACD-Histogram\nMACD stands for Moving Average Convergence-Divergence. This indicator\nwas developed by Gerald Appel, who combined three moving averagesinto two MACD lines. We can enhance MACD by plotting it as a histogram,reflecting the distance between those lines. It helps identify trends and ratethe power of bulls and bears. It is one of the best tools in technical analy-sis for catching reversals.\nBefore we use any indicator, we must understand how it is constructed\nand what it measures. As noted before, each price represents a momen-tary consensus of value of market participants. A moving average showsus the average consensus of value during a selected period of time. A fastmoving average reflects the average consensus during a short period oftime, and a slow moving average during a longer period of time. MACD-Histogram measures changes in consensus by tracking the spread betweenfast and slow moving averages.\nAppel used three exponential moving averages to create MACD:\n1.Calculate a 12-day EMA of closing prices.\n2.Calculate a 26-day EMA of closing prices.\n3.Subtract the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA—this is the fast or\nMACD line.\n4.Calculate a 9-day EMA of the fast line—this is the slow or signal line.\nThe values of 12, 26, and 9 have become standard numbers, used as de-\nfaults in most software packages. My testing shows that changing thesevalues has little impact on MACD signals, unless you go way out on a limband seriously distort their relationships by more than doubling one but notthe others. If you track several markets and do not have the time to cus-tomize your indicators, you can accept the default values of MACD. If youfollow only a few markets, it makes sense to experiment with higher andlower MACD values to find those that more closely track turning points inyour stocks or futures. If your software doesn’t include MACD, you mayuse two EMAs (for example, 12-day and 26-day) in lieu of the fast andslow MACD lines. Then apply the MACD-Histogram formula, on the nextpage, to the spread between those two averages.102 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThe fast line of MACD reflects a short-term consensus of value, while the\nslow signal line reflects a longer-term consensus. When the fast line risesabove the slow line, it shows that market participants are becoming morebullish. When bulls are becoming stronger, it is a good time to get long.When the fast line of MACD falls below the slow line, it shows that marketparticipants are becoming bearish. When bears become stronger, it is a goodMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 103\nFigure 5.8 MACD Lines\nEntry and exit signals are rarely symmetrical. The indicator that gives you\ngood entry signals is usually not the best indicator for exits; some other toolwill do a better job. MACD lines give entry signals when the fast line crossesthe slow line. If the fast line crosses above, it gives a signal to go long. When\nit crosses below, it gives a signal to sell short. Waiting for a crossover in the\nopposite direction to close out a position is not a good idea because by thattime a lion’s share of profits will have evaporated.\nCan you find a trading system in this chart? MACD lines tell you to enter\nat the crossover, but how will you decide when to exit? What tools can you\nuse to find out when a market surge is starting to fade and hop off with profit?\nAt the right edge of the chart MACD lines are in a buy mode, with a fast\nline above the slow and both rising. Prices are hovering above the EMA—anovervalued level. Buying at the right edge would mean taking a “greater fool\ntheory” trade. Placing a buy order in the vicinity of the rising EMA would\nallow us to buy value.\nbuy buybuy buysell sell sell\ntime to get short. MACD lines follow trends, and their crossovers mark trend\nreversals. Like all trend-following indicators, they work best when marketsare moving but lead to whipsaws during choppy periods. We can makeMACD more useful by converting it into MACD-Histogram.\nMACD-Histogram =Fast MACD line −Slow signal line\nMACD-Histogram measures the spread between short-term and long-\nterm moving averages and plots it as a histogram. It reflects the differencebetween short-term and long-term consensus of value. Some softwarepackages include MACD lines but not MACD-Histogram. In that case, runMACD lines, return to the menu and run an indicator called spread (or\nsimilar), which should measure the spread between the two lines and plotit as a histogram.\nWhen you look at MACD lines, their spread may appear tiny, but MACD-\nHistogram rescales it to fit the screen. The slope of MACD-Histogram showswhether bulls or bears are growing stronger. That slope is defined by the104 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nB\nAC\nFigure 5.9 MACD-Histogram\nA very powerful signal of MACD-Histogram, which occurs only once or\ntwice per year on a daily chart, is a divergence between the indicator peaksor bottoms and price extremes. In area A the Euro grinds down to a low ofTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nrelationship between the two latest bars. When the bars of MACD-Histogram\nrise (like the pattern of letters g-G), they show that the crowd is becomingbullish—it is a good time to be long. When the slope of MACD-Histogramdeclines (like in letters Q-q), it shows that the crowd is becoming bearish—it is a good time to be short.\nMarkets run on a two-party system—the bulls and the bears. When\nMACD-Histogram rises, it shows that bulls are becoming stronger, and whenit declines, it shows that bears are becoming stronger. MACD-Histogramhelps you bet on the winning party and sell short the opposition.\nThe Strongest Signal MACD-Histogram gives two types of signals. One\nis ordinary, and we see it at every bar—it is the slope of MACD-Histogram. An uptick of MACD-Histogram shows that bulls are strongerthan they were at the previous bar, and a downtick shows that bears aregaining. Those upticks and downticks provide minor buy and sell signals,but we shouldn’t read too much into them. Markets do not move inMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 105\n84 cents and MACD-Histogram confirms that low by tracing its own bottom,\nA. Prices rally into area B, and a strong rally of MACD-Histogram confirms\nits strength. It rises to a new multi-month high, showing that bulls are becom-\ning stronger below the surface of the bear market. Prices trace a double top\nin area B. The second top of MACD-Histogram in that area is a little lowerthan the first, warning of the imminent resumption of the downtrend. So far,\nthe indicator and prices are in gear, but from this point they diverge.\nIn area C prices crash to a new bear market low, while MACD-Histogram\nstops just below its centerline, creating a more shallow bottom than during itsprevious decline. When it ticks up from that low, it completes the bullish di-vergence and shows that bears have run out of steam and bulls are taking over.\nWhen two or three diverse technical tools flash the same message, they\nconfirm one another. Notice that prices have traced a false downside break-\nout in area C. That breakout has cleaned out stops placed by bulls and suckedin the most rabid bears who shorted. Premature bulls have been shaken out,late bears have been trapped, and the upside reversal is complete. Thosetrapped bears will have to cover shorts when they can no longer stand the\npain, adding fuel to the rally.\nAt the right edge of the chart prices are shooting higher from a bullish\ndivergence. This powerful pattern usually propels prices for weeks if notmonths.\nstraight lines, and it’s normal for MACD-Histogram to keep ticking up\nand down.\nThe other signal occurs rarely, only a couple of times per year on the\ndaily charts of most markets, but it’s worth waiting for because it is thestrongest signal in technical analysis. That signal is a divergence betweenthe peaks and bottoms of price and MACD-Histogram. A divergence occurswhen the trend of price highs and lows goes one way and the trend of topsand bottoms in MACD-Histogram goes the opposite way. Those patterns takeseveral weeks or even more than a month to develop on the daily charts. \nA bullish divergence occurs when prices trace a bottom, rally, and then\nsink to a new low. At the same time MACD-Histogram traces a differentpattern. When it rallies from its first bottom, that rally lifts it above thezero line, “breaking the back of the bear.” When prices sink to a new low,MACD-Histogram declines to a more shallow bottom. At that point,prices are lower, but the bottom of MACD-Histogram is higher, showingthat bears are weaker and the downtrend is ready for a reversal. MACD-Histogram gives a buy signal when it ticks up from its second bottom.\nOccasionally, the second bottom is followed by a third. This is why\ntraders must use stops and proper money management. There are no cer-tainties in the markets, only probabilities. Even a reliable pattern such asa divergence of MACD-Histogram fails occasionally, which is why we mustexit if prices fall below their second bottom. We must preserve our trad-ing capital and reenter when MACD-Histogram ticks up from its third bot-tom, as long as it is higher than the first.\nA bearish divergence occurs when prices rise to a new high, decline,\nand then rise to a higher peak. MACD-Histogram gives the first sign oftrouble when it breaks below its zero line during the decline from its firstpeak. When prices reach a higher high, MACD-Histogram rises to a muchlower high. It shows that bulls are weaker, and prices are rising simply outof inertia and are ready to reverse.\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles MACD-Histogram offers traders what\nx-rays offer doctors, showing the strength or weakness of the bone belowthe surface of the skin. Bulls or bears may appear powerful when pricesreach a new extreme, but a divergence of MACD-Histogram shows that thedominant party is becoming weak and prices are ready to reverse.\nGo long when MACD-Histogram traces a bullish divergence, that is,\nwhen prices fall to a new low while the indicator ticks up from a more shal-low low. Get long after MACD-Histogram ticks up from its second bottom.106 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nA bottom that is more shallow than the preceding one shows that bears\nhave grown weaker, and the uptick tells us that bulls are taking over. Placea protective stop below the latest bottom. Rallies from bullish divergencestend to be very powerful, but you must always use protection in case asignal does not work out.\nAn aggressive trader can make that stop “stop-and reverse,” meaning\nthat if stopped out of a long position, he will reverse and go short. Whena super-strong signal doesn’t pan out, it shows that something is funda-mentally changing below the surface of the market. If you buy on thestrongest signal in technical analysis and then your stop gets hit, it meansthat bears are especially strong, making it worthwhile to sell short.Reversing positions from long to short is usually not the best idea, but thefailure of a divergence of MACD-Histogram is an exception.\nI call this a Hound of the Baskervilles signal, after a story by Sir Arthur\nConan Doyle. Sherlock Holmes was called to investigate a murder on acountry estate. His clue came from the fact that the family dog did not barkwhile the crime was being committed. That indicated the dog knew thecriminal, and the murder was an inside job. Sherlock Holmes receivedhis signal not from the action but from the lack of expected action. Whena divergence of MACD-Histogram fails to produce a reversal, it gives aHound of the Baskervilles signal.\nGo short when the MACD-Histogram traces a bearish divergence, that is,\nwhen prices rise to a new high but the indicator ticks down from a lowerpeak. When the crowd gets on its hind legs and roars, it is tempting to\nthrow caution to the wind, close our eyes, and buy. When the crowd be-comes manic, it is hard to remain cool, but an intelligent trader looks forMACD-Histogram divergences. If prices rally, decline, and then rally to ahigher level, but MACD-Histogram rallies, falls below its zero line, break-ing the back of the bull, and rallies again, but to a lower level, it createsa bearish divergence. It shows that bulls have grown weaker, the stock isrising out of inertia, and as soon as that inertia runs out, the stock is likelyto collapse.\nMACD-Histogram flashes a signal to go short when it ticks down from\nits second peak. Once short, place a stop above the latest rally peak.Placing stops when shorting near the tops is notoriously difficult becauseof high volatility. Trading smaller positions allows you to place wider stops.\nDivergences between MACD-Histogram and prices on the daily charts\nare almost always worth trading. Divergences on the weekly charts usu-ally mark transitions between bull and bear markets.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 107\nWhen MACD-Histogram reaches a new multi-month peak, it indicates\nthat bulls are extremely strong, and the corresponding price peak is likelyto be retested or exceeded. When MACD-Histogram falls to a new multi-month low, it shows that bears are extremely strong, and the correspondingprice low is likely to be retested or exceeded.\nWhen MACD-Histogram rises to a new record peak, it shows a terrific\nsplash of bullish enthusiasm. Even if bulls pause to catch their breath, theupside inertia is so strong that the rally is likely to resume after a pause.When MACD-Histogram drops to a new low, it shows that bears are ex-tremely strong. Even if bulls manage to stage a rally, the sheer downsideinertia is likely to drive the market to retest or exceed its low.\nMACD-Histogram works like headlights on a car—it lights up a stretch\nof the road ahead. It doesn’t show you the entire way home, but lets yousee far enough so that driving at a normal speed you can prepare for thetwists and turns ahead.108 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nA\nC\nBD\nE\nFigure 5.10 The Hound of the Baskervilles Signal\nHeating oil, along with the rest of the oil complex, ran up to an historic high\nin November 2000. Then the demand shrunk, new supplies entered the mar-\nket, bullish mania was broken, and oil began to slide. In December, it fell to85 cents (point A), with MACD-Histogram tracing a new massive low, which\nForce Index\nForce Index is an oscillator developed by this author and first described\ninTrading for a Living . The decision to reveal Force Index was one of the\nhardest in writing that book. I felt reluctant to disclose my private weaponbut remembered how resentful I used to feel while reading books byauthors who wrote, in so many words, “Now, of course, you wouldn’texpect me to tell you everything,” I decided I would write either every-thing or nothing, and describe Force Index.\nThe disclosure did me no harm. Force Index continues to work for me\nas well as it did before. Very few software companies have included it intheir systems, and its behavior on my charts hasn’t changed. This remindsme of a good friend with whom I served on a ship. He was the biggestsmuggler I ever met, but he never hid anything far away. Sometimes he’dput the contraband right on his desk, under the noses of customs officers.\nLeaving a secret in the open can be the best way of hiding it.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 109\nindicated that bears were extremely strong. There was a brief reflex rally to\nthe EMA, while the indicator turned positive (breaking the back of the bear)\nand then declined to a more shallow low (point B). At that time prices tracedout a kangaroo tail, reaching down to 75 cents, and turned up. That bullishdivergence, combined with a tail, gave a buy signal. Remember, no matter\nhow strong the signal, a serious trader needs to use stops.\nHeating oil resumed its decline and gave a Hound of the Baskervilles\nsell signal when prices violated their bottom B in area C. It paid to switch\nto the short side then because heating oil eventually slid below 68. A vio-lation of a bullish divergence of MACD-Histogram is a prime example of\nthe Hound of the Baskervilles signal. The underlying fundamentals must be\nextremely strong to violate a divergence, and one is well advised to trade\nin the direction of the break after the stop is hit.\nIf you have the discipline to use stops and reverse after a divergence is vio-\nlated, you are not going to be afraid the next time you see a divergence. After\nseeing a new bullish divergence D-E you’ll put on a trade again, using the\nsame principles and rules.\nAt the right edge of the chart a minor bullish divergence is taking shape.\nPrices have briefly violated their March-April lows and rallied, completing a\nfalse downside breakout and giving a bullish signal. The EMA has stoppeddeclining and gone flat. From here, heating oil should be traded from the\nlong side, with a stop below the recent low.\nForce Index helps identify turning points in any market by tying together\nthree essential pieces of information—the direction of price movement, itsextent, and volume. Price represents the consensus of value among marketparticipants. Volume reflects their level of commitment, financial as well asemotional. Price reflects what people think, and volume what they feel.Force Index links mass opinion with mass emotion by asking three ques-tions: Is the price going up or down? How big is the change? How muchvolume did it take to move the price?\nIt is very useful to measure the force of a move because strong moves\nare more likely to continue than weak ones. Divergences between peaksand bottoms of prices and Force Index help nail important turning points.Spikes of Force Index identify zones of mass hysteria, where trendsbecome exhausted. Here is the Force Index formula:\nForce Index =(Close\ntoday−Closeyesterday )•Volumetoday\nIf the market closes higher today than yesterday, Force Index is positive,\nand if it closes lower, Force Index is negative. The greater the spreadbetween today’s and yesterday’s closes, the greater the force. The higherthe volume, the more forceful the move.\nForce Index is greater when the market moves far on high volume and\nlesser when the market moves a short distance on thin volume. When themarket closes unchanged, Force Index equals zero.\nSmooth Is Better We can plot Force Index as a histogram, with positive\nreadings above the zero line and negative readings below. The raw ForceIndex looks very jagged, up one day, down the next. It works better if wesmooth it with an exponential moving average and plot it as a line.\nIf we smooth Force Index with a long-term EMA of 13 days or longer, it\nwill measure long-term shifts in the balance of power between bulls andbears. To help pinpoint entries and exits, we should smooth Force Indexwith a very short moving average, such as a two-day EMA.\nWhen the trend of our stock or future is up and the two-day EMA of\nForce Index declines below zero, it gives a buy signal. When the trend isdown and the two-day EMA of Force Index rallies above zero, it gives asell signal. \nThe key to using a short-term Force Index is to combine it with a trend-\nfollowing indicator. For example, when the 22-day EMA of price is up andthe two-day EMA of Force Index becomes negative, it reveals a short-termsplash of bearishness within an uptrend, a buying opportunity. Once long,110 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 111\nFigure 5.11 Force Index—Two-Day EMA\nSpikes of a short-term, two-bar Force Index mark areas where trends exhaust\nthemselves. The downward spike in area A showed that the move from 56 to43 was at its end. Curiously enough, it was immediately followed by an\nupward spike in area B. This pattern of two adjacent spikes, pointing inopposite directions, shows a great deal of confusion in the markets and isusually followed by a period of flat prices. GE remained flat for almost two\nmonths following those two opposing spikes.\nTechnical patterns confirm one another when they give similar mes-\nsages. The downward spike in area C showed that the downtrend was\nbecoming exhausted. That bullish signal was followed by a bullish diver-\ngence between prices and Force Index, which traced a series of higher bot-\ntoms while prices tried to grind lower. For fans of classical charting, there\nwas a “reverse head-and-shoulders” pattern. Finally, there was a kangaroo\ntail at the very low. It looks as if GE keeps ringing a bell and telling us thatthe decline is over, it is ready to go up! In area D, half-way through the rise\nfrom 37 to 53, Force Index starts tracing a bearish divergence, warning\nthat bulls are losing power. When the EMA follows this up by turning\ndown in May, the bullish game is over. It is the last good chance to takeprofits and position short.\nAt the right edge of the chart the EMA is down and prices have just fallen\nto a new low, but Force Index is starting to trace a bullish divergence. It tells\nyou to tighten stops on short positions.\nS S\nTail\nH\nAB\nCD\n112 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nyou have several exit strategies. If you’re very short-term oriented, sell the\nday after Force Index turns positive, but if your time horizon is wider, holduntil prices hit their channel line or the EMA turns flat.\nWhen the 22-day EMA of prices is down, and the two-day EMA of Force\nIndex rallies above zero, it reveals a short-term splash of bullishness withina downtrend, a shorting opportunity. If you’re very short-term oriented,grab a quick profit and cover the day after Force Index turns negative. Ifyour time horizon is wider, use the lower channel wall for the profit target.\nWhen the two-day EMA of Force Index spikes up or down, exceeding its\nnormal peaks or lows by several times, it identifies an exhaustion move—a signal to take profits on existing positions.\nWhen the trend is up and the two-day EMA of Force Index traces a\nsharp upward spike, eight or more times above its normal height for thepast two months, it marks a buying panic. The bulls are afraid of missingthe train and bears feel trapped and cover shorts at any cost. Such spikestend to occur during end-stages of bull moves. They tell you it is a goodtime to take profits on long positions. Prices often rally to retest the spikeday’s high. By then the spirit is gone from the rally and other indicatorsstart developing bearish divergences, warning of a trend reversal.\nWhen the two-day EMA of Force Index traces a sharp downward spike\nduring a downtrend, four or more times deeper than normal for the pasttwo months, it marks an hysterical stage of the downmove. It identifies aselling panic among the bulls, who are dumping their holdings at anyprice to get out. Such spikes tend to occur at the end-stages of bear moves.They tell you that it’s a good time to take profits on short positions. Pricessometimes retest the spike day’s low, but by then most indicators aredeveloping bullish divergences and an upside reversal is coming.\nSpikes are somewhat similar to the kangaroo tails we discussed earlier\n(see “The Reality of the Chart” on page 73). The difference between themis that tails are purely price-based, while Force Index reflects volume aswell as prices. Tails and spikes identify panics among the weakest players.Once they get flushed out, the trend is ready to reverse.\nA Reversal Is Coming Trend reversals do not have to come as a surprise;\ndivergences between Force Index and price usually precede them. If themarket is trying to rally, but the peaks in Force Index are becoming lower,it is a sign of weakness among the bulls. If a stock or a future is trying todecline, but the bottoms in Force Index are becoming more shallow, it isa sign of weakness among the bears.\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 113\nFigure 5.12 Force Index—13-Day EMA\nA longer-term Force Index, smoothed with a 13-day EMA, identifies longer-\nterm shifts of power between bulls and bears. When it is below zero, bears\nare in control, and when it is above that line, the bulls are in charge.Divergences between the peaks of this indicator and price peaks precedemarket tops, whereas divergences between their lows precede importantbottoms.\nIn area A, Force Index traces a lower peak during the final price peak. It\nreveals that bulls are weak and a top is likely. A few days later, the EMA ticksdown, confirming that a new downtrend has begun. A mirror image of thispattern occurs in area B, where we see a lower closing price, a higher bot-\ntom of Force Index, and a few days later an uptick of the EMA, auguring an\nimportant rally. Notice also the double bottom in that area—a kangaroo tail,followed by a retest of the lows. This is one of many examples of patterns andindicators reinforcing each other. In area C Force Index traces a bearishdivergence and warns you that the bull move is over. A few days later the\nEMA ticks down, and it’s all downhill from there. The market keeps sending\nyou messages—all you have to do is listen.\nAt the right edge of the chart the market is declining, confirmed by the\nfalling EMA. Force Index is starting to trace a bullish divergence; it is time totighten stops on short positions.\nA Tail B C\n114 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nA divergence between an EMA of Force Index and price shows that the\ntrend is ready to reverse. Divergences between the patterns of peaks or\nbottoms of Force Index and prices show that the trend is becomingweaker. The power of this message depends on the length of the EMA withwhich we smooth our Force Index. If we use a very short EMA of ForceIndex, such as two days, its divergences help pinpoint the ends of short-\nterm trends lasting a week or so. If we use a 13-day or longer EMA ofForce Index, we can identify the ends of longer-term moves that last months.\nIf the trend is up and you are long, take profits when the two-day EMA\nof Force Index traces a bearish divergence—a lower peak in the indica-tor during a higher price in the market. If you are short, take profits whenthe two-day EMA of Force Index traces a bullish divergence—a higherbottom in the indicator during a lower price in the market. Take yourprofits and monitor the market from the sidelines. It is cheaper to exit andreenter than sit through a countertrend move.\nIt is essential to combine Force Index with trend-following indicators. If\nyou use this oscillator alone, it will lead to overtrading because it is so sen-sitive. In that case, only your broker will make money. The signals of ashort-term oscillator must be filtered using a long-term trend-followingindicator. This is the key principle of the Triple Screen trading system.\nThe Fifth Bullet\nA clip for an old army rifle held only five bullets. Going into action withsuch a weapon forced one to take good aim instead of shooting wildly.This is a good attitude for trading the markets.\nBy now, we have selected four bullets—exponential moving averages,\nchannels, MACD-Histogram, and Force Index. A moving average andMACD are trend-following indicators. Channels, Force Index, and MACD-Histogram are oscillators. What fifth bullet shall we pick?\nTo help you choose your fifth bullet, we’ll review several more tools.\nFeel free to range beyond this menu, but make sure to understand howeach indicator is constructed and what it measures. Test your indicators todevelop confidence in their signals.\nInTrading for a Living I described more than a dozen technical indi-\ncators. There are dozens more in other books on technical analysis.Quality and the depth of understanding are more important than quantity.A drowning amateur, grasping at straws, keeps adding indicators. Amature trader selects a few effective tools, learns to use them well, andfocuses on system development and money management.TEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nThere are no magic bullets in the markets. There is no perfect or\nultimate indicator. A trader who becomes preoccupied with indicators\nquickly reaches the point of diminishing returns. Your choice of analytictools depends on your trading style. The idea is to select your tools andquickly move on to where the real money is—system development andrisk management.\nElder-ray Elder-ray is an indicator developed by this author and named\nfor its similarity to x-rays. It shows the structure of bullish and bearishpower below the surface of the markets. Elder-ray combines a trend-following moving average with two oscillators to show when to enterand exit long or short positions. Most software developers fail to in-clude Elder-ray in their packages, but you can do it yourself with minimal\nprogramming.\nTo plot Elder-ray, divide your computer screen into three horizontal\npanels. Plot a chart of the stock you plan to analyze in the top panel andadd an exponential moving average. The second and third panels willcontain Bull Power and Bear Power, plotted as histograms. Here are theElder-ray formulae:\nBull Power =High −EMA\nBear Power =Low −EMA\nA moving average reflects the average consensus of value. The high of\neach bar reflects the maximum power of bulls during that bar. The low ofeach bar marks the maximum power of bears during that bar.\nElder-ray works by comparing the power of bulls and bears during each\nbar with the average consensus of value. Bull Power reflects the maximumpower of bulls relative to the average consensus, and Bear Power the max-imum power of bears relative to that consensus.\nWe plot Bull Power in the second windowpane as a histogram. Its\nheight reflects the distance between the top of the price bar and theEMA—the maximum power of bulls. We plot Bear Power in the third win-dowpane. Its depth reflects the distance between the low of the price barand the EMA—the maximum power of bears.\nWhen the high of a bar is above the EMA, Bull Power is positive. When\nthe entire bar sinks below the EMA, which happens during severe de-clines, Bull Power becomes negative. When the low of a bar is below theEMA, Bear Power is negative. When the entire bar rises above the EMA,which happens during wild rallies, Bear Power becomes positive.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 115\n116 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThe slope of a moving average identifies the current trend of the mar-\nket. When it rises, it shows that the crowd is becoming more bullish; it isa good time to be long. When it falls, it shows that the crowd is becomingmore bearish; it is a good time to be short. Prices keep getting away froma moving average but snap back to it, as if pulled by a rubber band. BullPower and Bear Power show the length of that rubber band. Knowing the\nFigure 5.13 Elder-ray\n“Buy low, sell high” sounds good, but traders and investors seem to have\nbeen more comfortable buying Lucent above 70 than below 7. Perhaps they\nare not as rational as the efficient market theorists would like us to believe?Elder-ray gives rational traders a glimpse into what is going on below the sur-face of the market.\nWhen the trend, identified by the 22-day EMA, is down and bulls are\nunder water, the rallies back to the surface mark shorting opportunities\n(arrows A and B). Prices draw a kangaroo tail in area C, and a sharp rally fol-lows. A rise from 5.50 to 11.50 is nothing to sneeze at; cheaper stocks tendto have bigger percentage gains. In area D, Lucent slides to a new low, but\nBear Power traces a more shallow bottom, completing a bullish divergence.\nThat false downside breakout traps bears. As the rally accelerates, Bear\npower becomes positive and each dip of Bear power back to its zero linemarks a buying opportunity (area E).\nAB\nCE D bull power\nbear power\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 117\nnormal height of Bull or Bear Power reveals how far prices are likely to get\naway from their moving average before returning. Elder-ray offers one ofthe best insights into where to take profits—at a distance away from themoving average that equals the average Bull Power or Bear Power.\nElder-ray gives buy signals in uptrends when Bear Power turns nega-\ntive and then ticks up. A negative Bear Power means that the bar is strad-dling the EMA, with its low below the average consensus of value. Waitingfor Bear Power to turn negative forces you to buy value rather than chaserunaway moves. The actual buy signal is given by an uptick of Bear Power,which shows that bears are starting to lose their grip and the uptrend isabout to resume. Take profits at the upper channel line or when a trend-following indicator stops rising. Profits may be greater if you ride theuptrend to its conclusion, but taking profits at the upper channel line ismore reliable.\nElder-ray gives shorting signals in downtrends when Bull Power turns\npositive and then ticks down. We can identify the downtrend by a declin-ing daily or weekly EMA. A positive Bull Power shows that the bar is strad-dling the EMA, with its high above the average consensus of value.Waiting for Bull Power to turn positive before shorting forces you to sellat or above value instead of chasing waterfall declines. The actual short-ing signal is given by a downtick of Bull Power, which shows that bullsare starting to slip and the downtrend is about to resume. Once short, takeprofits at the lower channel line or when the trend-following indicatorstops falling, depending on your style. You can make more money byholding on for the duration of the downtrend, but it is easier to achievesteady results by taking profits at the lower channel line. A beginningtrader is better off learning to catch short swings, while leaving long-termtrend trading for a later stage of development.\nStochastic This oscillator identifies overbought and oversold condi-\ntions, helping us buy low or sell high. Just as important, it helps avoidbuying at high prices or shorting at low prices. This indicator was popu-larized by George Lane decades ago and is now included in most soft-ware packages.\nStochastic measures the capacity of bulls to close prices near the top of\nthe recent trading range and the capacity of bears to close them near thebottom. It ties the high of the range, representing the maximum powerof bulls, with the low, representing the maximum power of bears, andwith closing prices, the final balance in the markets, representing theactions of smart money.\n118 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nBulls may push prices higher during the day, or bears may push them\nlower, but Stochastic measures their performance at closing time—the cru-cial money-counting time in the markets. If bulls lift prices during the daybut cannot close them near the high of the recent range, Stochastic turnsdown, identifying weakness and giving a sell signal. If bears push pricesdown during the day but cannot close them near the lows, Stochastic turnsup, identifying strength and giving a buy signal.\nThere are two types of Stochastic: Fast and Slow. Both consist of two\nlines: the fast line, called %K, and the slow line, called %D. We constructFast Stochastic in two steps and Slow Stochastic in three steps:\n1.Obtain %K,the fast line.\nwhere Close\ntoday=today’s close\nLown=the lowest low for the selected number of bars\nHighn=the highest high for the selected number of bars\nn =the number of bars for Stochastic (selected by the trader)\nWe have to choose the number of days, or bars, over which to calculate\nStochastic—the value of n. If we use a low number, below 10, Stochasticwill focus on the recent bars and flag minor turning points. If we choosea wider window, Stochastic will look at more data and flag major turns,missing minor ones.\nHow wide should we make the Stochastic window? Since we use oscil-\nlators to catch reversals, short-term windows are better; we should reservelonger time windows for trend-following indicators. Five or seven days area good starting point, but consider testing longer parameters to find theones that work best in your market.\n2.Obtain %D, the slow line. We obtain %D by smoothing the fast line\n%K over a number of bars that is shorter than %K. For example, if wedecide to plot a five-day Stochastic, we will use the value of five for the%K formula, above, and three bars for the %D formula, below:\n% • DClose Low\nHigh Lowtoday n\nnn=− ()\n− ()Three-bar sum of \nThree-bar sum of 100% • KClose Low\nHigh Lowtoday n\nnn=−\n−100\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 119\nFast Stochastic is very sensitive to price changes, making its lines appear\njagged. It pays to add one more step and convert it into a smoother SlowStochastic. Of course, a computer does this all automatically.\n3.Convert Fast Stochastic into Slow Stochastic. The slow line of Fast\nStochastic becomes the fast line of Slow Stochastic. Repeat step 2, above,to obtain the slow line %D of Slow Stochastic.\nStochastic is designed to oscillate between 0 and 100. Low levels mark\noversold markets, and high levels mark overbought markets. Overboughtmeans too high, ready to turn down. Oversold means too low, ready toturn up. Draw horizontal reference lines at levels that have marked previoustops and bottoms, starting with 15 near the lows and 85 near the highs.\nLook for buying opportunities when Stochastic nears its lower reference\nline. Look for selling opportunities when Stochastic nears its upper refer-ence line. Buying when Stochastic is low is emotionally hard because mar-\nkets usually look terrible near bottoms, which is precisely the right time tobuy. When Stochastic rallies to its upper reference line, it tells you to startlooking for selling opportunities. This also goes against the grain emo-tionally. When Stochastic rallies to a top, the market often looks fantastic,which is a good time to sell.\nWe should not use Stochastic alone, in a mechanical manner. When a\nstrong uptrend takes off, Stochastic quickly becomes overbought and startsflashing sell signals. In a powerful bear market, Stochastic becomes oversoldand flashes premature buy signals. This indicator works well only if you useit with a trend-following indicator and take only those Stochastic signals thatpoint in the direction of the main trend.\nShould a trader wait for Stochastic to turn up to recognize a buy signal?\nShould he wait for it to turn down to recognize a sell signal? Not really,because by the time Stochastic turns, a new move is usually under way. Ifyou are looking for an opportunity to enter, the mere fact of Stochasticreaching an extreme gives you a signal.\nGo long when Stochastic traces a bullish divergence, that is, when prices\nfall to a new low but the indicator makes a more shallow low. Go shortwhen Stochastic traces a bearish divergence, that is, when prices rise to anew high but the indicator ticks down from a lower peak than during theprevious rally. In an ideal buying situation, the first Stochastic low is below\nand the second above the lower reference line. The best sell signals occurwhen the first top of Stochastic is above and the second below the upperreference line.\n120 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAB C D E F G H I\nFigure 5.14 Stochastic\nIt may feel good to buy when prices are high and it brings relief to sell\nwhen prices fall, but Stochastic helps you do the right thing—buy low andsell high. When it declines to its lower reference line, it tells you themarket is oversold and gives a signal to buy (points B, C, and F). Whether\nyou buy or not, low Stochastic prevents you from shorting when it falls to\nlow levels.\nWhen Stochastic rises to its upper reference line, it gives a sell signal\n(points A, D, G, and H). A sell signal may be premature in a strong uptrend,\nbut whether you take it or not, one thing is clear—it is too late to buy.\nStochastic helps you avoid chasing trends.\nDivergences give the strongest signals. At point E, Exxon rises to a dou-\nble top, while Stochastic traces a lower top—a bearish divergence, a strongsell signal. A powerful rally begins in March, but by May there is a bearish\ndivergence—a sign that the party is coming to an end. There is one more\nchance to sell and go short when a triple bearish divergence appears at\npoint I—it is all downhill from there.\nAt the right edge of the chart XOM is declining, confirmed by the falling\nEMA. Stochastic is trying to trace a bullish divergence, but the second bot-\ntom is almost as low as the first; the bears are very strong, and the decline\nis likely to continue.\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 121\nDo not buy when Stochastic is above its upper reference line and do not\nsell short when it is below its lower reference line. These “no go” rules are\nprobably the most useful messages of Stochastic. Moving averages are bet-ter than Stochastic at identifying trends, MACD-Histogram is better at iden-tifying reversals, channels are better at identifying profit targets, and ForceIndex is sharper at catching entry and exit points. The trouble with themis that they give action signals most of the time. Stochastic identifies dan-ger zones, just like a line of red flags on a ski slope marks unsafe areasfor skiers. It says “no go” just when you feel tempted to chase a trend.\nReady to Hunt? Your choice of indicators depends on personal prefer-\nences, just like selecting a car. Be sure to combine trend-following indicators,which identify trends, with oscillators, which identify reversals.\nIn addition to the indicators described above, you may want to take a\nlook at the Directional indicator, which does a good job of signalingtrends. It consists of several components, one of which, ADX, helps iden-tify new bull markets. Williams %R is an oscillator similar to Stochastic,especially useful for showing when to pyramid winning positions. RelativeStrength Index (RSI) is an oscillator based entirely on closing prices. Ithelps track the behavior of market professionals who tend to dominatemarkets at closing time. All of them are described in Trading for a Living .\nKeep in mind that no single indicator can guarantee you victory in the\ntrading game. Trend-following indicators, such as moving averages, catchtrends but produce whipsaws in trading ranges. Oscillators identify topsand bottoms during trading ranges but flash premature countertrend sig-nals when the markets begin to run. Trading signals are easy to recognizein the middle of the chart, but hard to see at the right edge.\nThere is no magic indicator. All indicators are building blocks of trad-\ning systems. A good system uses several tools, combining them so thattheir negative features filter each other out, while their positive featuresremain undisturbed.\nCHAPTER\nSIX\nTRADING\nBeginners become emotional when they trade, but if you want to\nsurvive and succeed, you must develop discipline. The moment\nyou become aware of feeling fear or joy, use that as a signal to tightenyour discipline and follow your system. You developed that systemwhen the markets were closed and you felt calm. Now it gives youyour only chance of survival and success in the markets.\nThe idea of an automatic trading system is fundamentally flawed. If\nthose systems could work, then the smartest guy with the biggest com-puter would have cornered the market long ago. Automatic systems donot work because the market is not a mechanical or electronic entitythat follows the laws of physics. It is a huge crowd of people acting inaccordance with the imperfect laws of mass psychology. Physics andmathematics can help, but trading decisions must take psychology intoaccount.\nWhen you talk with a pro, one of the first questions he’ll ask—or\nnot even ask because he’ll know the answer from a few of your com-ments—is whether you are a discretionary trader or a system trader.\nA discretionary trader takes in market information and analyzes it using\nseveral technical tools. He is likely to shift and apply somewhat differenttools to different markets at different times. His decision-making tree hasmany branches, and he follows them at different times as market condi-tions change. All branches are connected to the sturdy trunk of his deci-sion-making tree, an inviolate set of rules for risk control.\nA system trader develops a mechanical set of rules for entering and\nexiting trades. He backtests them and puts them on autopilot. At thatpoint, an amateur and a pro go in opposite directions. An amateur,frightened by the market, feels relieved that a system, either his own\n123\nor bought from someone else, will free him from worry. Market con-\nditions always change and all systems self-destruct, which is why everyamateur with a mechanical system must lose money in the end. A prowho puts his system on autopilot continues to monitor it like a hawk.He knows the difference between a normal drawdown period and atime when a system deteriorates and has to be shelved and replaced.A professional system trader can afford to use a mechanical system pre-cisely because he is capable of discretionary trading!\nIn my experience, system traders tend to achieve more consistent\nresults, but the best and most successful traders use the discretionaryapproach. The choice depends on your temperament rather than acold business decision. Some people feel attracted to system trading,others to discretionary trading. Much of what you read in this bookdeals with discretionary trading. All of these components can be usedin systematic trading. This book is written to help both types of traders.\nA trading system is an action plan for the market, but no plan can\nanticipate everything. A degree of judgment is always required, evenwith the best and most reliable plans.\nThink of any other plan or system in your life. For example, you\nprobably have a system for taking your car out of the garage. You needto open the garage door, start the car, warm up the engine, and pullthe car out into the street without bumping into walls, running over tri-cycles, or getting hit by passing trucks.\nYou have a system in the sense that you perform the same actions\neach time in the same sequence, not thinking of the routine but pay-ing attention to what is important—watching out for dangers, such askids on bicycles, or freshly fallen snow, or a neighbor crossing thesidewalk. When you detect an obstacle, you deviate from your system,and return to it after the situation returns to normal. You would not tryto design a complete system, which would include dealing with thesnow, and the bicyclists, and the neighbors because that system wouldbe too complex and still could never be complete—a neighbor couldcome into your car’s path from another angle. A system automates rou-tine actions and allows you to exercise discretion when needed.\nAnd that’s what you need in the markets—a system for finding\ntrades, setting stops, establishing profit targets—all the while payingattention to a heavy truck headed toward you in the shape of a FederalReserve announcement or a kid on a tricycle in the form of a disap-pointing earnings report. Many beginners set themselves the impossible124 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\ntask of designing or buying a complete trading system, which is just as\nimpossible as a complete system for pulling your car out of the garage.\nI have two friends who earn a good living testing systems for traders.\nBoth are expert programmers. One of them laughed as he told me howhe gets at least one phone call a week from yet another amateur whothinks he has discovered the Holy Grail. He wants his automatic set ofrules backtested to find the best parameters, and his only concern is thatthe programmer should not steal his secret! I asked my friend how manyprofitable automatic systems he found during several years of backtesting.\nNot one.Not one? Doesn’t he get discouraged doing this kind of work?Well, what keeps him going is that he has a handful of steady clients\nwho are successful professional traders. They bring him snippets oftrading methods for testing. They may test their parameters for placingstops, the length of MACD, and so on. Then they use their own judg-ment to bind those snippets into a decision-making tree.\nAn intelligent trading system includes components that have been\nbacktested, but the trader retains control over his actions. He has sev-eral inviolate rules, mostly having to do with risk control and moneymanagement, but allows himself latitude in combining those compo-nents to reach trading decisions.\nAn intelligent trading system is an action plan for entering and exit-\ning markets that spells out several specific functions, such as findingtrades or protecting capital. Most actions, such as entries, exits, andadjusting stops, can be partly but not fully automated. Thinking is ahard job; a mechanical trading system tempts you by promising youwon’t have to think any more, but that’s a false promise. To be a suc-cessful trader you need to use your judgment. A trading system is astyle of trading, not an automatic turnkey operation.\nSYSTEM TESTING\nYou must test each indicator, rule, and method before including themin your trading system. Many traders do this by dumping historical datainto testing software and obtaining a printout of their system’s param-eters. The profit-loss ratio, the biggest and the smallest profit or loss,the average profit and loss, the longest winning and losing streaks, theaverage profit, and the average or the maximum drawdowns give theappearance of objectivity and solidity.TRADING 125\nThose printouts provide a false sense of security.\nYou may have a very nice printout, but what if the system delivers\nfive losses in a row, while you trade real money? Nothing in your test-ing has prepared you for that, but it happens all the time. You grit yourteeth and put on another trade. Another loss. Your drawdown is get-ting deeper. Will you put on the next trade? Suddenly, an impressiveprintout looks like a very thin reed on which to hang your future, whileyour account is being whittled away.\nThe attraction of electronic testing is such that there is now a small\ncottage industry of programmers who test systems for a fee. Sometraders spend months, if not years, learning to use testing software. Aloser who cannot admit he’s afraid to trade has a wonderful excuse thathe is learning new software. He’s like a swimmer who is afraid of water\nand keeps himself busy ironing his swimsuit.\nOnly one kind of system testing makes sense. It is slow, it is time-\nconsuming, and it does not lend itself to testing a hundred markets atonce, but it’s the only method that prepares you for trading. It consistsof going through historical data one day at a time, scrupulously writ-ing down your trading signals for the day ahead, then clicking yourchart forward and recording the trades and signals for the next day.\nBegin by downloading your stock or futures data for a minimum of\ntwo years. Swing to the left side of the file, without looking at whathappened next. Open your technical analysis program and a spread-sheet. The two most important keys for traders on a computer are Altand Tab because they let you switch between two programs. Open twowindows in your analytic program—one for your long-term chart withits indicators, the other for the short-term chart. Open a spreadsheet,write down your system’s rules at the top of the page and createcolumns for the date, entry date and price, and the exit date and price.\nTurn to the weekly chart and note its signal, if any. If it gives you a\nbuy or sell signal, go to the daily chart ending on the same date to seewhether it gives you a buy or a sell signal as well. If it does, record theorder you have to place in your spreadsheet. Now return to the dailychart and click one day forward. See whether your buy or sell order wastriggered. If so, return to the spreadsheet and record the result. Track yourtrade day by day, calculating stops and deciding where to take profits.\nFollow this process throughout your entire data file, advancing a\nweek at a time on the weekly chart, a day at a time on the daily chart.At every click write down your system’s signals and your actions.126 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAs you click forward, one day at a time, the market history will\nslowly unfold and challenge you. You click and a buy signal comesinto view. Will you take it? Record your decision in a spreadsheet. Willyou take profits at a set target, on a sell signal, or on the basis of priceaction? You are doing much more than testing a set of rigid rules.Moving ahead day by day, you develop your decision-making skills.This one-bar-at-a-time forward testing is vastly superior to what you getfrom backtesting software.\nHow will you deal with gap openings when prices open above your\nbuy level or below your stop? What about limit moves in futures?Should the system be adjusted, changed, or scrapped? Clicking forwardone day at a time gets you as close to the real experience of trading asyou can ever get without putting on a trade. It puts you in touch withthe raw edge of the market, which you can never experience throughan orderly printout from a professional system tester.\nManual testing will improve your ability to think, recognize events,\nand act in the foggy environment of the market. Your trading plansmust include certain absolute rules, most of them concerning moneymanagement. As long as you stay within those rules, you have muchfreedom in trading the markets. Your growing levels of knowledge,maturity, judgment, and skill are much more important assets than anycomputerized testing.\nPaper Trading\nPaper trading means recording your decision to trade and tracking it asif it were a real trade, only without money. Most of those who papertrade have lost their nerve after getting beat up by the markets. Somepeople alternate between real trades and paper trades and cannotunderstand why they seem to make money on paper but lose when-ever they put on a real trade.\nThis happens for two reasons. First, people tend to be less emotional\nwith paper. Good decisions are easier to make when your money is noton the line. Second, good trades often look murky at entry time. Theeasy-looking ones are more likely to lead to problems. A nervous begin-ner jumps into obvious-looking trades but paper trades the more prom-ising ones. It goes without saying that hopping between real tradingand paper trading is sheer nonsense. You either do one or the other.\nThere is only one good reason to paper trade—to test your discipline.TRADING 127\nIf you can download your data at the end of each day, do your\nhomework, write down your orders for the day ahead, watch the open-ing and record your entries, and then track your market each day,adjusting your profit targets and stops—if you can do all of this for sev-eral months in a row, recording your actions, without skipping a day—then you probably have the discipline to trade that market. Someonewho is in it for entertainment will not be able to paper trade this waybecause it requires work.\nTo paper trade your system, download your data at the end of each\nday. Apply your tools and techniques, reach trading decisions, calculatestops and profit targets, and write them down for tomorrow. Do not placeyour orders with a broker, but check whether they would have been trig-gered and write down those fills. Enter paper trades in your spreadsheetand your trading diary (see Chapter 8, “The Organized Trader”). If youhave the willpower to repeat this process daily for several months, thenyou have the discipline for successful trading with real money.\nStill, there is no substitute for trading with real money, because it\nengages emotions more than any paper trade. It is better to learn byputting on very small real trades than paper trades.\nTRIPLE SCREEN UPDATE\nOne of the most pleasant encounters that occur several times each yearis when a trader comes up to me at some conference and tells me howhe started trading for a living after studying my book or participatingin a Camp. At that point, he may be living and trading on a moun-taintop, and as often as not he owns the mountaintop. I noticed longago that half-way through our conversation these people becomeslightly apologetic. They tell me they use Triple Screen, but not exactlythe way I taught it. They may have modified an indicator, addedanother screen, substituted a tool, and so forth. Whenever I hear that,I know I am talking to a winner.\nFirst of all, I tell them they owe their success primarily to themselves.\nI did not teach them any differently than the dozens of others in thesame class. Winners have the discipline to take what is offered and useit to succeed. Second, I see their apology for having changed someaspects of my system as an indication of their winning attitude. To ben-efit from a system, you must test its parameters and fine-tune them untilthat system becomes your own, even though originally it was developedby someone else. Winning takes discipline, discipline comes from confi-128 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\ndence, and the only system in which you can have confidence is the\none you have tested on your own data and adapted to your own style.\nI developed the Triple Screen trading system in the mid-1980s and\nfirst presented it to the public in 1986 in an article in Futures magazine .\nI updated it in Trading for a Living and several videos. Here I will\nreview it, focusing on recent enhancements.\nWhat is a trading system? What’s the difference between a method,\na system, and a technique?\nA method is a general philosophy of trading. For example; trade with the\ntrend, buy when the trend is up, and sell after it tops out. Or—buyundervalued markets, go long near historical support levels, and sellafter resistance zones have been reached.\nA system is a set of rules for implementing a method. For example, if our\nmethod is to follow trends, then the system may buy when a multi-weekmoving average turns up and sell when a daily moving average turnsdown (get in slow, get out fast). Or—buy when the weekly MACD-Histogram ticks up and sell after it ticks down.\nA technique is a specific rule for entering or exiting trades. For example,\nwhen a system gives a buy signal, the technique could be to buy whenprices exceed the high of the previous day or if prices make a new lowduring the day but close near the high.\nThe method of Triple Screen is to analyze markets in several time-\nframes and use both the trend-following indicators and oscillators. Wemake a strategic decision to trade long or short using trend-followingindicators on long-term charts. We make tactical decisions to enter orexit using oscillators on shorter-term charts. The original method hasnot changed, but the system—the exact choice of indicators—hasevolved over the years, as have the techniques.\nTriple Screen examines each potential trade using three screens or\ntests. Each screen uses a different timeframe and indicators. Thesescreens filter out many trades that seem attractive at first. Triple Screenpromotes a careful and cautious approach to trading.\nConflicting Indicators\nTechnical indicators help identify trends or turns more objectively thanchart patterns. Just keep in mind that when you change indicatorparameters, you influence their signals. Be careful not to fiddle withindicators until they tell you what you want to hear.TRADING 129\nWe can divide all indicators into three major groups:\nTrend-following indicators help identify trends. Moving averages,\nMACD lines, Directional system, and others rise when the markets arerising, decline when markets fall, and go flat when markets enter trad-ing ranges.\nOscillators help catch turning points by identifying overbought and\noversold conditions. Envelopes or channels, Force Index, Stochastic,Elder-ray, and others show when rallies or declines outrun themselvesand are ready to reverse.\nMiscellaneous indicators help gauge the mood of the market crowd.\nBullish Consensus, Commitments of Traders, New High–New Low Index,and others reflect the general levels of bullishness or bearishness inthe market.\nDifferent groups of indicators often give conflicting signals. Trend-\nfollowing indicators may turn up, telling us to buy, while oscillatorsbecome overbought, telling us to sell. Trend-following indicators mayturn down, giving sell signals, while oscillators become oversold, giv-ing buy signals. It is easy to fall into the trap of wishful thinking andstart following those indicators whose message you like. A trader mustset up a system that takes all groups of indicators into account andhandles their contradictions.\nConflicting Timeframes\nAn indicator can call an uptrend and a downtrend in the same stock onthe same day. How can this be? A moving average may rise on a weeklychart, giving a buy signal, but fall on a daily chart, giving a sell signal.It may rally on an hourly chart, telling us to go long, but sink on a 10-minute chart, telling us to short. Which of those signals should we take?\nAmateurs reach for the obvious. They grab a single timeframe, most\noften daily, apply their indicators and ignore other timeframes. Thisworks only until a major move swells up from the weeklies or a sharpspike erupts from the hourly charts and flips their trade upside down.Whoever said that ignorance was bliss was not a trader.\nPeople who have lost money with daily charts often imagine they\ncould do better by speeding things up and using live data. If you can-not make money with dailies, a live screen will only help you losefaster. Screens hypnotize losers, but a determined one can get even closerto the market by renting a seat and going to trade on the floor. Prettysoon a margin clerk for the clearing house notices that the new trader’s130 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nequity has dropped below limit. He sends a runner into the pit who\ntaps that person on the shoulder. The loser steps out and is never seenagain—he has “tapped out.”\nThe problem with losers is not that their data is too slow, but their\ndecision-making process is a mess. To resolve the problem of conflict-ing timeframes, you should not get your face closer to the market, butpush yourself further away, take a broad look at what’s happening,make a strategic decision to be a bull or a bear, and only then returncloser to the market and look for entry and exit points. That’s whatTriple Screen is all about.\nWhat is long term and what is short term? Triple Screen avoids rigid\ndefinitions by focusing instead on the relationships between time-frames. It requires you to begin by choosing your favorite timeframe,which it calls intermediate. If you like to work with daily charts, yourintermediate timeframe is daily. If you are a day-trader and like five-minute charts, then your intermediate timeframe is the five-minutechart, and so on.\nTriple Screen defines the long term by multiplying the intermediate\ntimeframe by five (see “Time—The Factor of Five,” page 87). If yourintermediate timeframe is daily, then your long-term timeframe is weekly.\nIf your intermediate timeframe is five minutes, then your long-term ishalf-hourly, and so forth. Choose your favorite timeframe, call it inter-mediate, and immediately move up one order of magnitude to along-term chart. Make your strategic decision there, and return to the\nintermediate chart to look for entries and exits.\nThe key principle of Triple Screen is to begin your analysis by step-\nping back from the markets and looking at the big picture for strategicdecisions. Use a long-term chart to decide whether you are bullish orbearish, and then return closer to the market to make tactical choicesabout entries and exits.\nThe Principles of Triple Screen\nTriple Screen resolves contradictions between indicators and time-frames. It reaches strategic decisions on long-term charts, using trend-following indicators—this is the first screen. It proceeds to maketactical decisions about entries and exits on the intermediate charts,using oscillators—this is the second screen. It offers several methodsfor placing buy and sell orders—this is the third screen, which we mayimplement using either intermediate- or short-term charts.TRADING 131\nBegin by choosing your favorite timeframe, the one with whose\ncharts you like to work, and call it intermediate. Multiply its length byfive to find your long-term timeframe. Apply trend-following indicatorsto long-term charts to reach a strategic decision to go long, short, orstand aside. Standing aside is a legitimate position. If the long-termchart is bullish or bearish, return to the intermediate charts and useoscillators to look for entry and exit points in the direction of the long-term trend. Set stops and profit targets before switching to short-termcharts, if available, to fine-tune entries and exits.\nS\nCREEN ONE\nChoose your favorite timeframe and call it intermediate. Multiply it by\nfive to find the long-term timeframe. Let’s say you prefer to work with\ndaily charts. In that case, move immediately one level higher, to theweekly chart. Do not permit yourself to peek at the dailies because thismay color your analysis of weekly charts. If you are a day-trader, youmight choose a 10-minute chart as your favorite, call it intermediate,and then immediately move up to the hourly chart, approximately fivetimes longer. Rounding off is not a problem; technical analysis is a craft,not an exact science. If you are a long-term investor, you might choosea weekly chart as your favorite and then go up to the monthly.\nApply trend-following indicators to the long-term chart and make a\nstrategic decision to trade long, short, or stand aside. The original ver-\nsion of Triple Screen used the slope of weekly MACD-Histogram as itsweekly trend-following indicator. It was very sensitive and gave manybuy and sell signals. I now prefer to use the slope of a weekly expo-nential moving average as my main trend-following indicator on long-term charts. When the weekly EMA rises, it confirms a bull move andtells us to go long or stand aside. When it falls, it identifies a bearmove and tells us to go short or stand aside. I use a 26-week EMA,which represents half a year of trading. You can test several differentlengths to see which tracks your market best, as you would with anyindicator.\nI continue to plot weekly MACD-Histogram. When both EMA and\nMACD-Histogram are in gear, they confirm a dynamic trend and en-courage you to trade larger positions. Divergences between weeklyMACD-Histogram and prices are the strongest signals in technicalanalysis, which override the message of the EMA.132 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTRADING 133\nAB\nFigure 6.1 Triple Screen—Weekly Chart\nGaming stocks tend to do well in a weak economy—gambling appeals to\npeople down on their luck. In 2000 and 2001, as the broad stock market wasdeclining, gaming stocks put in a stellar performance. Alliance Gaming, forinstance, rallied from below 2 to over 40, with very few pullbacks. Howcould Triple Screen help us benefit from this performance?\nThe pattern between points A and B is called a saucer bottom, a slow\ndrawn-out minimal decline and just as minimal a rise on hardly any vol-ume. Still, during that time ALLY had managed to put in a bullish diver-gence of MACD-Histogram, a hugely powerful signal that is rarely seenon weekly charts. It traced a low in area A, but could not even pushbelow zero at the bottom of the saucer. The first vertical arrow marks thepoint where MACD-Histogram starts trending higher. A few weeks laterthe weekly EMA also turns up, and at that point, with both weekly indi-cators trending up, ALLY becomes a screaming buy. It is time to switch tothe daily charts and look for buying opportunities. The second vertical\narrow marks another period when both the EMA and MACD-Histogramare in gear to the upside, and then the stock doubles in a few weeks. Theclean, steady uptrend of the weekly EMA keeps telling us to trade ALLYonly from the long side.\nAt the right edge of the chart, the weekly EMA keeps trending higher,\nbut wildly volatile price action shows that the easy portion of the uptrendis over. MACD-Histogram is moving opposite the EMA, warning of highvolatility ahead. The relatively easy money is off the table.\nSCREEN TWO\nReturn to the intermediate chart and use oscillators to look for trading\nopportunities in the direction of the long-term trend. When the weekly\ntrend is up, wait for daily oscillators to fall, giving buy signals. Buyingdips is safer than buying the crests of waves. If an oscillator gives a sellsignal while the weekly trend is up, you may use it to take profits onlong positions but not to sell short.134 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nFigure 6.2 Triple Screen—Daily Chart\nThe uptrend on the weekly chart keeps telling us to trade ALLY from the\nlong side or stand aside. With the daily EMA also rising, we have severaloptions. We may buy when prices pull back to their rising daily EMA, orwhen short-term Force Index dips below zero. The upper channel line pro-vides a logical profit-taking target. An experienced trader can pyramidhis position, adding to it whenever a new buy signal appears and onlytightening stops instead of exiting at the upper channel. That channel keepsgetting wider as prices rise—from 10 points wide in April to 16 in July.\nAt the right edge of the chart, the alternating spikes of Force Index\nwarn traders that the days of relatively easy money are over. The markethas become hysterical, and the likelihood of trend continuation is low.Better bank your winnings and go look for another stock in another groupthat is rising or falling quietly, not yet discovered by the market crowd.TEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nWhen the weekly trend is down, look for daily oscillators to rise,\ngiving sell signals. Shorting during upwaves is safer than selling newlows. When daily oscillators give buy signals, you may use them totake profits on shorts but not to buy. The choice of oscillators dependson your trading style.\nFor conservative traders, choose a relatively slow oscillator, such as\ndaily MACD-Histogram or Stochastic, for the second screen. When theweekly trend is up, look for daily MACD-Histogram to fall below zeroand tick up, or for Stochastic to fall to its lower reference line, givinga buy signal.\nReverse these rules for shorting in bear markets. When trend-\nfollowing indicators point down on the weekly charts, but daily MACD-Histogram ticks down from above its zero line, or Stochastic rallies toits upper reference line, they give sell signals.\nA conservative approach works best during early stages of major\nmoves, when markets gather speed slowly. As the trend accelerates,pullbacks become more shallow. To hop aboard a fast-running trend,you need faster oscillators.\nFor active traders, use the two-day EMA of Force Index (or longer,\nif that’s what your research suggests for your market). When theweekly trend is up and daily Force Index falls below zero, it flags abuying opportunity.\nReverse these rules for shorting in bear markets. When the weekly\ntrend is down and the two-day EMA of Force Index rallies above zero,it points to shorting opportunities.\nMany other indicators can work with Triple Screen. The first screen\ncan also use Directional System or trendlines. The second screen canuse Momentum, Relative Strength Index, Elder-ray, and others.\nThe second screen is where we set profit targets and stops and make\na go–no go decision about every trade after weighing the level of riskagainst the potential gain.\nSet the stops. A stop is a safety net, which limits the damage from any\nbad trade. You have to structure your trading in such a way that nosingle bad loss, or a nasty series of losses, can damage your account.Stops are essential for success, but many traders shun them. Beginnerscomplain about getting whipsawed, stopped out of trades that eventu-ally would have made them money. Some say that putting in a stopmeans asking for trouble because no matter where you put it, it willbe hit.TRADING 135\nFirst of all, you need to place stops where they are not likely to be\nhit, outside of the range of market noise (see SafeZone on page 173).Second, an occasional whipsaw is the price of long-term safety. Nomatter how great your analytic skills, stops are always necessary.\nYou should move stops only one way—in the direction of the trade.\nWhen a trade starts moving in your favor, move your stop to a break-even level. As the move persists, continue to move your stop, protect-ing some of your paper profit. A professional trader never lets a profitturn into a loss.\nA stop may never expose more than 2% of your equity to the risk of\nloss (see Chapter 7, “Money Management Formulas”). If Triple Screenflags a trade but you realize that a logical stop would risk more than2% of your equity, skip that trade.\nSet profit targets. Profit targets are flexible and depend on your goals\nand capital. If you are a well-capitalized, long-term-oriented trader, youmay build up a large position at an early stage of a bull market, repeat-edly taking buy signals from the daily charts, as long as the weeklytrend is up. Take your profits after the weekly EMA turns flat. The re-verse applies to downtrends.\nAnother option is to take profits whenever prices on the daily\ncharts hit their channel line. If you go long, sell when prices hit theupper channel line and look to reposition on the next pullback to thedaily moving average. If you go short, cover when prices fall to theirlower channel line and look to reposition short on the next rally tothe EMA.\nA short-term-oriented trader can use the signals of a two-day EMA\nof Force Index to exit trades. If you buy in an uptrend when the two-day EMA of Force Index turns negative, sell when it turns positive. Ifyou go short in a downtrend after the two-day EMA of Force Indexturns positive, cover when it turns negative.\nBeginners often approach markets like a lottery—buy a ticket and sit\nin front of the TV to find out whether you have won. You will knowthat you are becoming a professional when you start spending almostas much time thinking about exits as looking for entries.\nSCREEN THREE\nThe third screen helps us pinpoint entry points. Live data can help savvytraders but hurt beginners who may slip into day-trading.136 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nUse an intraday breakout or pullback to enter trades without real-\ntime data. When the first two screens give you a buy signal (the weekly\nis up, but the daily is down), place a buy order at the high of the pre-vious day or a tick higher. A tick is the smallest price fluctuation per-mitted in any market. We expect the major uptrend to reassert itself andcatch a breakout in its direction. Place a buy order, good for one dayonly. If prices break out above the previous day’s high, you will bestopped in automatically. You do not have to watch prices intraday,just give your order to a broker.\nWhen the first two screens tell you to sell short (the weekly is down,\nbut the daily is up), place a sell order at the previous day’s low or atick lower. We expect the downtrend to reassert itself, and try to catchthe downside breakout. If prices break below the previous day’s low,they will trigger your entry.\nDaily ranges can be very wide, and placing an order to buy at the\ntop can be expensive. Another option is to buy below the market. Ifyou are trying to buy a pullback to the EMA, calculate where that EMAis likely to be tomorrow and place your order at that level. Alternatively,use the SafeZone indicator (see page 173) to find how far the market islikely to dip below its previous day’s low and place your order at thatlevel. Reverse these approaches for shorting in downtrends.\nThe advantage of buying upside breakouts is that you follow an\nimpulse move. The disadvantage is that you buy high and your stop isfar away. The advantage of bottom fishing is that you get your goodson sale and your stop is closer. The disadvantage is the risk of gettingcaught in a downside reversal. A “breakout entry” is more reliable, butprofits are smaller; a “bottom-fishing entry” is riskier, but the profits aregreater. Make sure to test both methods in your markets.\nUse real-time data, if available, for entering trades. When the first\ntwo screens give you a buy signal (the weekly is up, but the daily isdown), use live data to get long. You could follow a breakout fromthe opening range, when prices rally above the high of the first 15 to30 minutes of trading, or apply technical analysis to intraday chartsand finesse your entry. When trying to short, you may enter on adownside breakout from the opening range. You could also monitorthe market intraday and use technical analysis to enter into a shorttrade, using live charts.\nThe techniques for finding buy and sell signals on real-time charts are\nthe same as on daily charts, only their speed is much higher. If you useTRADING 137\nweeklies and dailies to get in, use them also to get out. Once a live chart\ngives an entry signal, avoid the temptation to exit using intraday data.Do not forget that you entered that trade on the basis of weekly anddaily charts, expecting to hold for several days. Do not be distracted bythe intraday chop if you are trading swings that last several days.\nDAY-TRADING\nDay-trading means entering and exiting trades on the same day. Watch-ing money flow from the screen into your account is extremely appeal-ing. Surely we are smart enough to use modern technology to outrunslow-moving folks who follow their stocks through the newspapers.\nEvery partial truth contains a dangerous lie. Day-trading can bring\nprofits to professionals, but it is also a common last stop for losers whoblow what little is left of their accounts. Day-trading offers advantagesand disadvantages, while placing extreme demands on its practitioners.\nDay-trading offers one of the markets’ greatest challenges, but it\nis amazing how little literature on it exists. There are several “day-trading for dummies” types of books, a few get-rich-quick jobs, butnot a single definitive volume on day-trading. Bad day-traders writebad books and good day-traders are too action-oriented to sit downto write.\nA good day-trader is a street-smart person with fast reflexes. He is\nquick, confident, and flexible. Successful day-traders are so focused onthe immediate results that they do not make good writers. I hope oneof them will rise to the challenge of writing a book, but in the mean-time, here are a few notes, even though each of them deserves its ownchapter in a thick book on day-trading.\nThe late 1990s saw an explosion of interest in day-trading. Even\nhousewives and students were pulled in by the bull market and theeasy reach of the Internet. Brokers advertise for more people to comein to day-trade, knowing full well most will bust out.\nThe advantages of day-trading include:\nTrading opportunities are more frequent. If you can trade with daily\ncharts, you’ll see similar trades more often on intraday charts.\nYou can cut losses very quickly.There is no overnight risk if a major piece of news hits your market\nafter the close.138 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThe disadvantages of day-trading include:\nYou miss longer-term swings and trends.\nProfits are smaller because intraday swings are shorter.Expenses are higher because of more frequent commissions and\nslippage. Day-trading is a very expensive game, which is why ven-dors love it.\nDay-trading makes several hard demands on its practitioners:You must act instantly—if you stop to think, you’re dead. With daily\ncharts you have the luxury of time, but intraday charts demandimmediate action.\nDay-trading chews up a great deal of time. You have to ask yourself\nwhether the hourly pay is better in longer-term trading.\nDay-trading plays into people’s gambling tendencies. If there are any\ngaps in your discipline, day-trading will find them fast.\nThere are three main groups of day-traders: floor traders, institu-\ntional traders, and private traders. They have different agendas and usedifferent tools. Imagine three persons coming to the beach—one goesfor a swim, another stretches in the sun, and the third goes jogging andruns head on into a tree. Floor traders and institutional traders tend todo better than private traders. Let us see what we can learn from them.\nLessons from Floor Traders\nFloor traders stand in the pit, trading with each other, but more oftenagainst the public. They scalp, spread, and take directional trades.\nScalping is based on the fact that there are two prices for any stock\nor future. One is a bid—what the pros are offering to pay. The otheris an ask—what the pros are willing to sell for. You may bid below themarket, but as a friend said, “You can’t excite the market with a flac-cid bid.” When in a hurry, you buy at the ask and pay what sellersdemand. If you want to sell, you may place a limit order above themarket or “hit the bid” and accept what buyers are willing to pay.\nFor example, the last trade in gold was at 308.30, but now it is\nquoted as 308.20 bid, 308.40 ask. This means there are willing buyersat 308.20, while sellers are asking for 308.40. When a market order tobuy comes into the pit, a floor trader goes short by selling at 308.40.The outsider has paid the ask price, and the floor trader is now shortTRADING 139\nand needs to buy. When a market order to sell comes to the floor, he\nbuys at 308.20, and pockets 20 cents profit. Floor traders pay no com-missions, only clearing costs, and can afford to trade even for singleticks. They stand on their feet all day, yelling to all passersby that theywant to buy a tick below the market and sell a tick above. It is thehighest paid form of manual labor.\nThis is a simplified example. The reality is less orderly, as floor\ntraders try to widen the spread and make more than one or two ticks.They compete with one another, shouting, jumping, and getting intoeach other’s faces. It helps to be tall and muscular and have a bigvoice. You get stabbed with pencils and splattered with saliva. Thereis a story about a floor trader who died of a heart attack on the floorbut remained upright, squeezed in by the crowd.\nA floor trader can get stuck if he buys a tick below the market but\nthe market falls by two ticks, and puts him underwater. Half of all floortraders disappear in their first year. One of the Chicago exchanges putsred circular badges on the chest of new traders, making them look likeshooting targets. Lest you start feeling sorry for floor traders, keep inmind that many of them make a very good living and some make agreat deal of money from hitting you for a tick or more on every trade.Before electronic trading became a serious threat, seats on some ex-changes sold for a million dollars.\nFloor traders also get involved in spreading—buying and selling\nrelated markets when their relationships get out of line. Spread traderstend to be more cautious and better capitalized than scalpers. Finally,some of the wealthiest floor traders get involved in directional trading.They put on trades that last days or weeks, closer to the timeframe ofpublic traders.\nWhat lessons can we learn from the floor? If you are a position trader,\nyou should use limit orders whenever possible. Buy and sell at speci-fied prices, and don’t let the floor scalp you. Put those fellows on a diet.Another lesson is to stay away from scalping. When a crowd of athleticyoung men starts fighting for ticks, jumping, salivating, and screaming,you have no business reaching into that crowd to grab a few ticks foryourself because they’ll take off your fingers. If you day-trade awayfrom the floor, forget about scalping. Look for the longer-term day-trades, where the competition tapers off a bit. Go to the middle groundbetween scalpers who chase ticks and position traders with theirend-of-the-day charts. Try to find one or two trades a day, longer than\nscalping but shorter than position trades.140 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nLessons from Institutional Day-Traders\nInstitutional traders work for banks, brokerage houses, and similar\nfirms. A company may have more than a hundred traders sitting behindrows of expensive equipment. Maintaining each seat costs severalthousand dollars a month, not counting salaries and bonuses. Eachinstitutional trader narrowly focuses on a single market. One may tradeonly two-year Treasury notes, another only five-year notes, and so on.\nInstitutional traders generate paper-thin returns on huge volumes of\ncapital. A friend of mine who trades bonds for a leading investmentbank in New York has access to essentially unlimited capital during theday, but his overnight positions are capped at $250 million. His stan-dard deviation, the amount he usually wins or loses in a trading day,is $180,000. This is 0.072% of his overnight limit, and only about0.010% of his intraday size.\nHis profits appear large until you express them as a percentage of his\naccount and ask yourself what you would earn if you traded as well ashim. Suppose your account is $250,000 or one-thousandth of his $250million. If you could match my friend’s percentage gains, you’d earn$180 on overnight trades and $25 at the end of a busy day-trading ses-sion. That would hardly cover your costs! Why do institutions do it?\nThe big boys benefit from economies of scale, but the main reason\nthey stay in the game is to keep themselves visible to potential cus-tomers. Their main income comes from commissions and spreads oncustomer orders. Institutional traders accept paper-thin returns to main-tain a presence in the market, which gives them first dibs on lucrativecustomer business. They work to maintain visibility, and as long as theydo not lose money, they’re happy.\nThe main thing we can learn from institutional traders is their rigid\nsystem of discipline, with managers forcing them to cut losses. A pri-vate trader has no manager, which is why he needs to design andimplement a strict system of money management rules. Institutionaltraders benefit from focusing on a single market, unlike private traderswho may jump from cocoa today to IBM tomorrow. It pays to choosejust a few trading vehicles and learn them well.\nInstitutions are busy scalping, and a private trader is better off keep-\ning out of this area to avoid getting trampled. If you see a trade thatoffers only a few ticks, it is safer to pass it up because the institutionscan barge in at any moment. The longer your timeframe, the less com-petition you have from them.TRADING 141\nPrivate traders have one enormous advantage over institutions, but\nmost of them toss it away. Corporate traders must broadcast their bidand ask in order to maintain a presence in the markets. “How are youfor 5 dollar/yen,” calls a customer, wishing to trade $5 million for yenor vice versa. The bank trader must quote his bid and ask, ready totake either side of that trade. He must trade at all times, while a pri-vate trader has the luxury of waiting for the best moment.\nYou are under no obligation to buy or sell. You have the freedom\nof standing aside, but most private traders throw away this awesomeadvantage. People get sucked into the excitement of the game. Theyjump in instead of waiting for the best trades. Remember, the idea isto trade well, not to trade often.\nGetting the Data\nReal-time data tends to be pricey, and you must cover its cost beforetaking home a dime. Many exchanges make fortunes selling real-timedata, forcing vendors to delay free broadcasts to the public. The 20-minute delay preserves entertainment value, but trying to use that datafor day-trading is like driving a car with cardboard for a windshield,looking out through a side window. Day-trading is a very fast game,played by some very clever people. Trying to compete against them onthe basis of delayed data is a joke.\nMost day-traders use software to display, chart, and analyze their data.\nReal-time analytic software has been around for years, but the great NAS-DAQ bull market led to an upsurge in the popularity of Level 2 quotes,which show who is bidding and offering what stock. This is ballyhooedas the new road to riches. Most of those riches go to vendors and bro-kers who benefit from hyperactive trading. I haven’t noticed anyimprovement in the overall performance of private traders with Level 2quotes. The early users may have had an advantage a few years ago,when the concept was new, but once it became popular, the edge dis-appeared. This is a common story with new technologies—early usersget an edge, the tool becomes a fad, and the edge fades away.\nA day-trader needs a dedicated computer, good analytic software,\nand a fast connection to the Internet. This setup may cost several thou-sand dollars, plus a monthly bill of a few hundred dollars for live dataand exchange fees. You can reduce the cost of data by following justone market, which is not a bad idea because it helps keep you focused.142 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nSome professional futures traders dispense with computers alto-\ngether. They quit their day jobs and go on the floor. Some move to acity that has an exchange where they buy or lease a seat. Costs arehigher on bigger exchanges that handle high volumes in popular mar-kets, and cheaper on smaller exchanges in lesser markets. The bestway to learn is to get a job as a clerk on the floor and work for some-one, but this option is open only to the young—the floor generallydoesn’t hire people over 25. They want them young, pliable, and with-out any preconceived ideas.\nPsychology\nThe great paradox of day-trading is that it demands the highest level ofdiscipline, while attracting the most impulsive, addictive, and gambling-prone personalities. If trading is a thrill, then day-trading provides thebest rush. It is a joy to recognize a pattern on your screen, put in anorder, and watch the market explode in a stiff rise, stuffing thousandsof dollars into your pockets. A former military pilot said that day-trading was more exciting than sex or flying jet aircraft.\nCorporate traders are in the market because their companies gave\nthem jobs. Private traders enter for reasons that are partly rational andpartly irrational. The only rational reason is to make money, but a prof-itable day-trade delivers such a great high that it sweeps most peopleoff their feet. Flooded with pleasure, they go looking for the next highand lose money.\nThe purpose of any business is to make money. A well-run business\nalso gratifies many of its owners’ and employees’ psychological needs,but money is the pivot of the enterprise. Traders who become hookedon thrills take their eyes off the money and jump into impulsive trades.Vendors encourage day-traders because losers spend like drunkensailors on software, data, systems, and even coaches, most of whomhave never traded or busted out. Go into any port area, and you’llsee plenty of bars, brothels, and tattoo parlors. Go into day-trading,and you’ll see more vendors than you can shake a stick at. There is moneyto be made from turkeys whose market life is measured in monthsor weeks.\nSuccessful day-traders test patterns and systems, measure risks and\nrewards, and focus on building equity. Winners tend to be emotionallycool. If day-trading attracts you, you must answer several questions:TRADING 143\nAre you successfully trading with end-of-day charts? If the answer is\n“no,” stay away from day-trading. You need a minimum of oneyear successful trading experience before attempting to day-trade.\nDo you have an addictive streak? If you have a history of drinking,\ndrugs, overeating, or gambling, stay as far away as possible fromday-trading because it will trigger your addictive tendency anddestroy your account.\nDo you have a written business plan? How much money will you\ntrade? In what markets? How will you choose entries and exits?How will you manage risks, use stops, and allocate capital? Do\nnot go near day-trad ing without a written plan. Be sure to keep\nseparate records for day-trading and position trading. Find outwhich one is more profitable for you.\nChoosing the Market\nDay-trading compares to position trading like flying to driving.Comfortably seated behind the wheel of a car you can lean back,listen to music, use a cell phone, and even glance at a magazine whilestopped at a red light. Do not attempt that in a jet.\nDay-trading demands total concentration on a single market. It is\nlike serial monogamy—you may trade several markets in your career,but only one at any given time. What market will you choose? The twoessential features of a good day-trading market are high liquidity andvolatility.\nLiquidity refers to the average daily volume of your trading vehicle—\nthe higher, the better. It is easy to join a huge crowd and just as easyto leave without drawing attention to yourself and distorting the mar-ket with your order. When you place a market order to buy or sell athinly traded stock or a commodity, you give the pros a license to skinyou alive in slippage. If you use a limit order, it may never get filled.Trading a big liquid market, such as IBM or soybeans, allows you toget in and out more easily with less slippage.\nVolatility refers to the average daily range of your trading vehicle.\nThe greater the distance between the high and the low of the day, thebigger your target. Shooting at a big target is easier than shooting at atiny one. Remember our discussion of channels? If you know how totrade, you will get more money from a wide channel, at any level ofskill. Someone who trades at C level and takes 10% from a channel willget 1 point from a 10-point channel, but 2 points from a 20-point chan-144 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nnel. A C-level trader has no business day-trading, but even an A trader\nwants as big a target as possible.\nYou can find good liquidity and volatility in the leading stocks,\nfutures, and currencies. Another important feature of a day-tradingmarket is its personality. Some markets move smoothly, others like tojump. Bonds, for example, tend to spend a day or two in a very nar-row range, then explode, moving more in half an hour than in severalpreceding days, and then fall asleep again. Trading them is like infantryfighting—90% sheer boredom and 10% sheer terror.\nWhat markets should you day-trade? In stocks, look at those that\nshow up on the list of the most active issues of the day. That’s wherethe action is. These stocks’ liquidity is very high, and their volatility tendsto be good. Explore the list of top gainers and losers for the day. Whenthe same name shows up on that list day in and day out, it is clearlyamong the most volatile issues, with great day-trading potential.\nWhen it comes to futures, make your first steps in such relatively peace-\nful markets as corn, sugar, or copper. Once you’ve learned the ropes,consider moving up to stock index futures or the futures on the GermanBund, both among the favorite vehicles of professional day-traders.\nAnalysis and Decision Making\nIf you remove price and time markings from a chart, you won’t beable to tell whether it is weekly, daily, or intraday. Markets are fractal,to borrow a term from chaos theory. To recall our earlier discussion,the seashore is fractal, since the coastline looks equally jagged fromany height. Since charts in different timeframes are so alike, we mayanalyze them using similar methods.\nComing to day-trading after a year or more of successful position\ntrading gives you a great advantage. You can use the same methods,and only have to speed them up. You can use the principles of TripleScreen to make strategic decisions on longer-term charts and tacticalchoices on shorter-term charts.\nSCREEN ONE\nAnalyze your market on a longer-term chart, using trend-following indi-cators, and make a strategic decision to trade long, short, or stand aside.\nChoose the timeframe you prefer to trade and call it intermediate. Let\nus select a five-minute chart for our intermediate timeframe, with eachbar representing five minutes of trading. You can choose a longer chartTRADING 145\n146 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nA\nWed Thu Fri\nFigure 6.3 Day-Trading—25-Minute Chart\nIf we prefer a five-minute chart for day-trading, we should start our analy-\nsis with a timeframe that is five times longer, a 25-minute chart. Differentstocks go in and of out of favor with day-traders. Human GenomeSciences (HGSI) is popular today, with strong, healthy trends and nogaps. There is a downtrend on Monday, which bottoms out on Tuesday,turns up on Wednesday, and rises into Friday, with a pullback at the endof that day as longs take profits before the weekend.\nThere is a strong buy signal right at the opening on Wednesday as the\nEMA turns up, confirmed by the uptick of MACD-Histogram. As EMAkeeps rising, it tells us to trade HGSI from the long side; the firstscreen of T riple Screen is bullish. This signal is much more important than\nany uptick or downtick of MACD-Histogram. When MACD rises in gearwith the EMA, it suggests trading larger size, but when it declines, it is aperfectly normal “breathing” behavior, as long as there is no bearishdivergence.\nAt the right edge of the chart the market is closing for the weekend.\nThe EMA is slightly rising, so bulls have to be given the benefit of doubt.Also, MACD-Histogram has declined to the level normally associatedwith bottoms; it is closer to a bottom than to a top. We should wait for theopening on Monday, anticipating a buy signal, while being prepared totrade from the short side if the EMA ticks down.\nTRADING 147\nif you wish, but not much shorter, as that might pit you against insti-\ntutional scalpers. To stand completely apart from the crowd, you mayselect an unorthodox length, such as seven or nine minutes.\nSome day-traders, intoxicated by the promise of technology, use\none-minute or even tick charts. These provide the illusion that you arepresent on the floor, even though it can easily take half a minute orlonger for the data to be keyed in, uploaded to the satellite, and broad-cast to your screen. You are not on the floor, you are behind. Whenmarkets begin to run, time lags get even worse.\nMultiply your intermediate timeframe by five to find the long-term\ntimeframe. If your intermediate timeframe is five minutes, use a 25-\nminute chart. If your software does not allow plotting 25-minute charts,round it off to half an hour. A successful trader needs to stand apartfrom the crowd. This is why it pays to use uncommon parameters forcharts and indicators. There are probably thousands of people usinghalf-hourly charts, but only a tiny minority uses 25-minute charts andgets its signals a little faster.\nApply a trend-following indicator to the long-term chart and use its\ndirection to make a strategic decision to trade long, short, or stand aside.Start with a 20- or 30-bar EMA and adjust its length until it tracks yourmarket with a minimum of whipsaws. When the 25-minute EMA rises, itidentifies an uptrend and tells you to trade from the long side or stand\naside. When the EMA falls, it identifies a downtrend and tells you to\ntrade only from the short side or stand aside. Make a strategic decision onthis long-term chart before returning to your intermediate-term charts.\nSuccessful day-traders tend to rely less on indicators and more on\nchart patterns. The gaps between trading days can distort intraday indi-cators. Still, some indicators, such as moving averages and envelopes,also called channels, are useful even with intraday charts.\nSCREEN TWO\nReturn to the intermediate (five-minute) charts to look for entries in thedirection of the trend.\nPlot a 22-bar EMA on the five-minute chart and draw a channel\nthat contains about 95% of price action. Moving averages reflect the\naverage consensus of value, while channels show the normal limits ofbullishness and bearishness. We want to get long during uptrends, buy-ing below the EMA on a five-minute chart, and short in downtrends,above the EMA. Do not get long above the upper channel line, where\nthe market is overvalued, or sell short below the lower channel line,\nwhere it is undervalued.\nUse oscillators, such as MACD-Histogram and Force Index, to iden-\ntify overbought and oversold areas. Trade in the direction of the tide,\nentering when a wave goes against the tide. When the 25-minute trendis up, falling prices and oscillators on a five-minute chart reflect a tem-porary bearish imbalance—a buying opportunity. When the 25-minutetrend is down, rising prices and oscillators on a five-minute chart reflecta temporary bullish imbalance—a shorting opportunity.\nDay-traders sometimes ask whether they should analyze weekly and\ndaily charts. The weekly trend is essentially meaningless for them, andeven the daily is of limited value. Looking at too many timeframes canlead to “paralysis from analysis.”\nPlace SafeZone stops. After entering a trade, place a protective stop,\nusing the SafeZone method (see page 173). Consider making it “on close148 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThu FriAB C D E\nFigure 6.4 Day-Trading—Five-Minute Chart\nThe long-term 25-minute chart has told us to trade HGSI from the long\nside.

If\nthe 25-minute trend is up, buy pullbacks to the EMA on a five-minutechart, especially when oscillators are oversold. Reverse the procedurein downtrends.

It declines back to the EMA, giving ample opportunities to\nposition long, even if you missed the first signal. The MACD bottom inarea C is more shallow, showing that bears are weaker, reinforcing thebuy signal. Prices make four more attempts to reach the upper channelline. You can sell at any of them, but if you have not sold during the firstthree, the fourth is a must. It is getting late in the day, you already knowthat today prices do not seem to be able to reach their upper channelline, and as a day-trader you do not want to hold overnight. Sure enough,during the last half-hour there is a downdraft, as day-traders who over-stayed the uptrend start pushing through the door, trying to get out.\nOn Friday, there is a buy signal right at the opening, followed by a\nquick rally to the upper channel line for profit taking, and then anotherdecline to the EMA (point D). The subsequent rallies never quite reach theupper channel line, but there is another buying opportunity at point E,during a pullback to the EMA. There are two weak rallies later in the after-noon, and if you do not use them to take profits, there is one last ringfor the hard of hearing when the EMA turns down. Intraday charts oftenhave countertrend moves late in the day, as traders with paper profits startclosing positions.\nAt the right edge of the chart, the trading day and the trading week are\nover. You have no overnight risk and can relax before the opening onMonday, when the 25-minute MACD-Histogram will tell you whether totrade this stock from the long or the short side.\nminute oscillators, such as MACD-Histogram, are making new highs\nand related markets are rallying, you may wait for the channel to behit or penetrated. If the indicators are weak, grab your profit fast with-out waiting for prices to touch the channel.\nMeasure your performance as the percentage of the channel width.\nYou must be an A trader to make day-trading worthwhile. Even then,you have to prove to yourself that you can make more money day-trading than position trading. Try to trade only a few times a day andaim to catch at least a third of that day’s range. Enter cautiously, butrun fast. Do not trade during after-hours sessions when markets tendto be very thin.\nTaking Day-Trades Overnight\nIf you enter a trade early in the day and the market keeps moving inyour favor, should you hold that trade overnight? How about over theweekend? Of course, those questions only apply to profitable trades.Taking a loss overnight is strictly for losers.\nA beginner must close his day-trades by the end of the day, but an\nexperienced pro has the option of holding them overnight. When amarket closes within a few ticks of its high, it usually exceeds it thenext morning. A market that closes on its lows usually flirts with lowerlows the next day. Those extensions are not guaranteed, as the marketmay close on its high, get hit with bad news overnight, and opensharply lower. This is why only experienced day-traders have theoption of taking their trades overnight.\nResearch, knowledge, and discipline put your trades on a cooler,\nmore rational footing. You have to research the past, calculate theodds, and make informed decisions for the future. When you day-trade, there are plenty of hours when the market goes nowhere, leav-ing you free to crunch the numbers. You may use a single computeror get two machines and dedicate one to trading and another toresearch.\nGet one year’s history for the market you’re day-trading. Drop it into\na spreadsheet and start asking questions. Every time the market closedwithin 5 ticks of its high, how many times did it reach a new high thenext day? How far did it go the next day? What about the days whenthat market closed within 5 ticks of the lows? How low did it go thenext day? Once you get the answers, find out what happened whenthe market closed within 10 ticks of the high, and so on.150 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nProfessionals tend to trade the same market month after month,\neven though there is a huge turnover of amateurs. Professionals havegrown used to trading in a certain way, and to trade like them youmust find those patterns and express them in numbers. You must baseyour trades on facts and probabilities, not on gut feel and hope. Youmust do your own research. You cannot buy the answers, because onlyfinding them yourself will give you the confidence to trade.\nOpening Range Breakouts\nPeople get tips at parties, from the newspapers, and on TV, that glue-box of mass culture. Investment officers at slow-moving institutionsmay sit in a meeting all day before getting permission to buy or sell.They tend to place orders before the open. Most overnight orderscome from casual investors, gamblers chasing hot tips, and brokerswho want to leave work early to play golf or make marketing calls.\nThe two busiest times for professional traders are the beginning and\nthe end of each session, especially the first and last half-hour periods.The influx of overnight orders gives professionals an opportunity toperform a public service by accommodating those who are eager to getin at the opening. They unwind those positions near the close, whenone loser after another throws in the towel. Many pros go out for lunchin the middle of the day, which is why many markets tend to becomedirectionless and choppy between 12 and 1:30. The curve of intradayvolume tends to be U-shaped, with peaks at the open and the close,and a low in the middle.\nSerious traders watch openings because they set the tone for the bal-\nance of the day. If the total size of buy orders exceeds that of sell orders,the floor opens the market higher, forcing the crowd to pay up. Prosestablish short positions at such high levels that the very first drop makesthem money. If the volume of sell orders is higher, the pros open the mar-ket lower, load up on the cheap, and sell at a profit on the first bounce.\nDuring the first 15 to 30 minutes after the open many stocks and\nfutures swing up and down on high volume. As the bulk of overnightorders gets filled, volume starts to dry up, and the swings slow down,retreating from the high and the low of the opening range. What hap-pens next largely depends on the width of the opening range.\nWhen the opening range is very wide, say 80% of an average daily\nrange for the past month, it is likely to have set both the high and thelow for that day. The floor loves wide opening ranges because theirTRADING 151\n152 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAB\nCDEFGH\nFigure 6.5 Day-Trading—Opening Range Breakout\nElder-ray, 5-minute chart\nStocks for day-trading should have heavy volume, be volatile, and be\nexpensive rather than cheap, so that they have decent intraday ranges. Atthe time of this writing, Checkpoint is definitely on the list, along withNVDA, TARO, and a few other swingers. By the time you read this, otherstocks will be in the forefront of day-traders’ attention.\nCHKP has been rallying, coming off the market’s recent lows and clos-\ning at 39.44. Today it opens at 39.26 at 9:30 (point A) and within 10 min-utes runs up to 40.25 (point B), establishing the high of the openingrange. It then drifts lower, hitting the low of 38.93 at 10:10 \nA.M.—the low\nof the opening range (point C). For the next hour and a half CHKP mean-ders within its fairly narrow opening range of only 1.32, but by 11:35 it runsup to its upper edge and penetrates it by 3 ticks (point D). The next bar is7 ticks higher—this is no false breakout, this is a real opening range break-out, the trend is up, and we have to get long. The 13-bar EMA is steadilyrising. Whenever Bear Power returns to the zero line and turns nega-tive, it shows that bears have regained their footing—a good time to addto longs within an uptrend (points E, F, G, and H). At 15:25 (point I) the EMAturns down, giving a sell signal—time to take profits on long positions.\nAt the right edge of the chart, the day is over, and we may count prof-\nits before going home. If you bought on the first buy signal following theopening range breakout and sold when the EMA turned down, your profitis 42.15 −40.40 =1.75. Multiply this by the number of shares you traded,\nand add other positions if you pyramided.\nTRADING 153\nextremes provide two good levels of support and resistance. The pros\nkeep buying near the lows, shorting near the highs, and spending therest of the day unwinding their positions at a profit. A narrow openingrange makes it more likely that the market will break out of it and starta new trend for the day.\nThe high and the low of an opening range are like the feet of a\nboxer. When they are wide apart, the boxer is stable and in control,but when they are close, it is easy to knock him off balance and forcehim to move.\nOutsiders love trends and chase breakouts, but the floor operates in\na reactive mode, selling the highs and buying the lows. It prefers flattrading ranges to runaway trends. The floor usually wins, but once ina while outsiders overwhelm the pros and push the market into atrend. When that happens, smart floor traders cut their losses and run,while the dumb and the stubborn contribute to the mortality rate.\nThe opening range has several implications for day-traders:\nThe opening and closing prices, like two poles of a magnet, tend to\nbe at the opposite extremes of a day’s bar. If the market opensnear the low of a wide opening range, expect it to close near theupper edge and look for buying opportunities. If it opens near thehigh of a wide opening range, expect it to close lower and lookfor shorting opportunities.\nBreakouts from wide opening ranges tend to be false. When prices\ntake out the high or the low of a wide opening range, be alert tothe possibility of the breakout petering out and be ready to tradeits return into the range.\nWhen the opening range is narrow, expect a breakout and be ready\nto trade in its direction.\nSuccessful traders test everything. There are hours in most days when\nthe market is undecided, neither a buy nor a sell. Use that time toresearch its opening ranges—how many minutes they take to form inyour stock or future, how wide they tend to be, and so on. Create agraph linking the height of the opening range with the likelihood ofa breakout, and you’ll acquire a private tool, a real edge in the markets.\nCurrencies—Trading the 24-hour Markets The United States is the\nonly country in the world where most people don’t think much aboutcurrencies. We live in the dollar universe, but the moment an American\nsets foot abroad, he realizes that everyone, from executives to taxi\ndrivers, watches exchange rates. When the people outside the UnitedStates, and even recent immigrants to the United States, get a bit oftrading capit al, their first idea is to trade currencies. The bulk of currency\ntrading takes place in the interbank market, directly between dealers.\nBeginners turn to unscrupulous currency trading shops that buckettheir orders (hold their money without executing trades) and kill themwith commissions, spreads, and interest charges. Survivors discovercurrency futures, where spreads are more narrow, commissions morereasonable, and no interest is charged for the privilege of holding aposition.\nAside from the horrors of forex shops, the biggest challenge of cur-\nrencies is that they trade around the clock. You may enter a trade, ana-lyze it in the evening, and decide to take profits the next day. Whenyou wake up, there is no profit to be taken. The turning point you sawcoming has already come and gone, not in the United States, but inAsia or Europe. Someone has picked your pocket while you slept!Markets are tough enough without exposing yourself to 24-hour risk.\nBig financial institutions deal with this problem by implementing a\nsystem of “passing the book.” A bank may open a position in Tokyo,manage it intraday, and then transfer it to its London branch beforeclosing for the night. London continues to trade that position and inthe evening passes the book to New York, which trades it until itpasses it back to Tokyo. Currencies follow the sun, and small traderscan’t keep up with it. I once visited a wealthy Thai gentleman who wasplanning to install his two sons and himself in three different citiesaround the globe to trade currencies, but the boys balked.\nIf you trade currencies, you should either take a very long-term view\nand ignore daily fluctuations, or else day-trade, avoiding overnightpositions. If you trade currency futures, use two sets of data. Use cashor interbank data for your weekly charts and futures data for the dailiesto pinpoint entries and exits. The daily charts of currency futures arefull of overnight gaps because those markets are open for only a fewhours a day, but the charts of cash are smooth.\nS&P 500—False Breakouts S&P futures are notoriously hard to trade,\nbut newcomers are drawn to them like moths to a flame. “Are you manenough to trade the S&P?!” is the battle cry of those overgrown boys.Most traders are woefully undercapitalized for this expensive contract.It is hard to see how anyone with less than a quarter million in his154 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\naccount could trade a single contract of this volatile market, which\noften jumps several points of $250 each within minutes.\nThe floor takes full advantage of the fact that most gamblers do not\nhave enough money to carry overnight positions, place sensible stops,or ride out small adverse moves. The floor has got the art of shak-ing out inexperienced day-traders down to a science. They use falsebreakouts to make losers jump like Pavlov’s dogs, buying high andselling low.\nThe floor tries to push prices through several well-known levels on\nmost days, flushing out weak holders. There is always a mass of sellstops below the low of the opening range and the low of the day.Shoving the market through those lows leads to selling by weak hold-ers, and the pros then buy their merchandise on sale. There is alwaysa mass of buy stops at the high of the opening range, the high of theday, and the high of the previous day, placed by weak shorts. Pushingthe S&P through those levels sets off panicky buying. That’s whenthe floor sells short, positioning itself for the next downswing. Thereis nothing uniquely devious about this game, only it works especiallywell in the S&P because there are so many amateurs and this marketis so expensive that they have no staying power.\nA day-trader who recognizes the special challenges of the S&P can\nreach several conclusions:\nThis is not a good market for beginners; it is too expensive and too\nfast. Learn to drive an old Chevy before a turbocharged Ferrari.\nHave a good-sized account if you plan to trade this market. A quar-\nter of a million dollars for each contract gives you staying powerand allows you to place sensible stops.\nFade false breakouts in the S&P—trade against them. Use oscillators\nto detect when a false breakout starts running out of steam, andtrade for the return into the middle of the day’s range.\nThe Daily Plan\nA day in front of a live screen includes many dead hours when nothingseems to happen. People grow bored and restless, and the next thingyou know, a day-trader turns his screen into an entertainment center.Professionals tend to follow a timetable to reinforce their discipline.\nYour trading day should start before the opening. Give yourself at\nleast half an hour to assemble and analyze overnight data. Watch thefirst half hour of trading with no interruptions, not even phone calls. IfTRADING 155\nyou put on a trade, then manage it. Otherwise dedicate two hours to\nresearch, database maintenance, reading a trading magazine or a book,\nor trolling the net for fresh ideas, all the while in front of the screen.Suspend everything if the market looks close to giving a buy or sellsignal. Have lunch at your desk if you are managing a trade. Reviewtrading-related posts on the net and put more time into research.Consider keeping exercise equipment in your trading room, such as astationary bicycle or a rowing machine. A healthy mind in a healthybody. As the closing approaches, the market again demands your undi-vided attention, especially if you are exiting a trade.\nThere are two reasons to have a daily plan. You need to make sure\nthat all the necessary work gets done, trades found, placed, exited,recorded, and research conducted. The other reason is to remind your-self that you are day-trading as a business and not for amusement andthat you are serious about success.\nRemember that your feelings, desires, and anxieties are part and\nparcel of the game. When feelings are unsettled, trading becomes aproblem. I had a client in the late 1990s who had achieved phenome-nal success day-trading just one stock, AOL. He looked at yesterday’sclosing price, checked the levels at which AOL traded in Europe, andreviewed any overnight news. When AOL shot out of the gate after theopen, he traded its first swing, and sometimes two or three more dur-ing the first 30 minutes or an hour. He grossed $5,000 almost dailywithin the first hour of trading, buying and selling 1,000 shares at aclip. Then he spent the rest of day pissing that money away and losing!\nWhen he came to consult me, it was obvious that his system worked\nwell only during the first hour. It tracked an overnight buildup of pres-sure, and once that pressure equalized, he had no edge. His systemwas fantastically effective—as long as he stopped trading an hour afterthe opening. But he could not stop!\nIt turned out that his self-esteem was largely based on trying to win\nhis old father’s respect. The father was an immigrant who built a suc-cessful business by the dint of hard work, and he only respected menwho worked hard and put in long hours. My client felt that he hadto keep on “working” in the markets all day rather than turn off hiscomputer and go outside to play golf, drive his boat, or putter in thegarden. He did not want psychotherapy. I tried calling him at 10:30to remind him to stop trading, but then he got caller ID to avoid mycalls. A great system is only half the game; the other is trading psy-chology. The only goal of successful traders is to grow equity. Every-156 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nthing else, in cluding love, respect, and so forth, has to be gained outside\nthe markets.\nTHEIMPULSE SYSTEM\nHigh volatility during the bull market of the 1990s made momentumtrading very popular. The idea is to jump aboard a fast-moving stockas it begins to run and hop off after it slows down. Momentum tradersdo not care about company fundamentals; they may not even knowwhat that company does. All they care about is direction and speed.They buy when a stock rallies (they rarely go short) and hope to cashout before the impulse runs out.\nThe game of momentum trading appears deceptively easy. The\nowners of trading rooms make fortunes in commissions, while legions\nof traders lose even bigger fortunes trying to grab money from fast-\nmoving stocks. Impulse trading tends to degenerate into impulsivetrading, and the game is over.\nMomentum trading has a built-in psychological contradiction that’s\ndeadly to most people. On the one hand, this fast game, like infantryfighting or video game playing, is best suited for young people withstrong hunting instincts, capable of abandoning themselves to the game.On the other hand, momentum trading requires the cold detached disci-pline of a professional card counter in a casino. Successful momentumtrading, like professional gambling, is a boring business. The ability toaccept small steady gains—essential for momentum trading—is very rare.Few people can walk away from the table just as the party gets going.\nOne of my favorite clients is a professional trader in London who\nsometimes, for entertainment, goes to a casino at night. He playsblackjack for a minimum stake of £5 and quits when he is either £200ahead or £400 behind. He has worked out a card-counting methodand a money management system that have him going home with £20013 times out of 14. He has proven to himself that he can steadily winat the casino, and now he rarely goes there because he must spend6 or 7 hours counting and betting before reaching his winning or los-ing limit. It is hard work, counting all the time. The crowd of amateursaround him is having a lot of fun losing. My client prefers to stay homeand trade stocks where the odds are much more to his liking.\nSuccessful momentum trading requires great discipline. You must\nidentify a price move, hop aboard without waiting for a better confir-mation, and jump off as soon as that move slows down. The longerTRADING 157\nyou wait to identify the momentum, the less money is left for you.\nTaking profits is stressful because of a normal human tendency to holdout for a little more and then beat yourself up for having left too early.A momentum trader needs a set of technical rules, a money manage-ment system, and iron discipline to enter when the time is right andexit without regrets after hitting his profit target or a loss limit.\nEntries\nI designed this system to identify the inflection points where a trendspeeds up or slows down. The Impulse System works in any timeframe,including intraday. It provides buy and sell signals, but leaves it up toyou to select good markets, tweak parameters, and supply the discipline.\nChoose an active market whose prices swing in a broad channel.\nWhat happens if you make a C trade and grab only 10% of a channelwidth? This result is not too bad if the channel is 20 points wide, buta C trade is an exercise in futility if the channel is only 5 points wide.Chase fat rabbits, don’t waste your time on skinny ones.\nThe Impulse System combines two simple but powerful indicators.\nOne measures market inertia, the other its momentum. When bothpoint in the same direction, they identify an impulse worth following.We get an entry signal when both indicators get in gear, but as soon asthey stop confirming one another, we take that as an exit signal.\nThe Impulse System uses an exponential moving average to find\nuptrends and downtrends. When the EMA rises, it shows that inertiafavors the bulls. When EMA falls, inertia works for the bears. The sec-ond component is MACD-Histogram, an oscillator whose slope reflectschanges of power among bulls or bears. When MACD-Histogram rises,it shows that bulls are becoming stronger. When it falls, it shows thatbears are growing stronger.\nThe Impulse System flags those bars where both the inertia and the\nmomentum point in the same direction. When both the EMA andMACD-Histogram rise, they show that bulls are roaring and the uptrendis accelerating. When both indicators fall together, they show that bearsare crushing the market. Those indicators may stay in gear with eachother for only a few bars, but that’s when the market travels fast—theimpulse is on!\nBefore you rush to apply the Impulse System to your favorite mar-\nket, remember how Triple Screen analyzes markets in more than one158 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\ntimeframe. Select your favorite timeframe and call it intermediate.\nMultiply it by five to define your long-term timeframe. If your favoritechart is daily, analyze the weekly chart to make a strategic decisionto be a bull or a bear. Use a 26-week EMA, the slope of weekly MACD-Histogram, or both, on the weekly chart.\nOnce you’ve defined the long-term trend, return to your daily chart\nand look for trades only in the direction of the weekly. The ImpulseSystem uses a 13-day EMA and a 12-26-9 MACD-Histogram. The EMA,tracking market inertia, is a little shorter than our usual 22 bars, mak-ing the system more sensitive.\nWhen the weekly trend is up, turn to the daily charts and wait for\nboth the 13-day EMA and MACD-Histogram to turn up. When bothinertia and momentum rise, you have a strong buy signal, telling youto get long and stay long until the buy signal disappears.\nWhen the weekly trend is down, turn to the daily charts and wait for\nboth the 13-day EMA and MACD-Histogram to turn down. They give youa signal to go short, but be ready to cover when that signal disappears.\nSome technical programs allow you to mark price bars with different\ncolors. Make them green when both the EMA and MACD-Histogramrise, and red when both indicators fall. Don’t mark the bars where theindicators point in the opposite directions. This lets you easily see sig-nals at a glance.\nProgramming differs for different software packages, but here’s how\nI programmed buy signals into Internet Trader Pro:\nAlertMarker (mov (c,13,e) > ref (mov (c,13,e), −1) and fml \n(“MACD-Histogram”) > ref (fml (“MACD-Histogram”), −1), Below)\nHere is the code for sell signals:\nAlertMarker (mov (c,13,e) < ref (mov (c,13,e), −1) and fml \n(“MACD-Histogram”) < ref (fml (“MACD-Histogram”), −1), Above)\nIf you know how to program, you can add more features to the sys-\ntem. You can make its EMA length variable and test different lengths,looking for those that work best in your market. You can programsound alarms for buy and sell signals and monitor a number of mar-kets without being glued to the screen. There is a fisherman on theesplanade near where I live who has several fishing poles, each witha little bell. Whenever a fish bites, a bells rings, the man puts his news-paper down and starts reeling it in.TRADING 159\n160 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAB\nFigure 6.6 The Impulse System\nWhen both EMA and MACD-Histogram point in the same direction,\nthey identify an accelerating market move. The best way to see Impulsesignals is to program buys and sells in different colors. Trade in thedirection of an impulse to catch the sharpest, most dynamic moves.Also, never, ever trade against the Impulse. For example, a bullish diver-gence, a double bottom, and a kangaroo tail in March and April allpoint to an important bottom, but you may not buy as long as Impulseis down. The sell signal disappears at point A, and that’s when you maygo long.\nThe Impulse System beautifully tracks the bear move in January-March\nand the bull move in April–May. In May, bearish divergence B is followedby the disappearance of an Impulse buy signal, which permits shorting.The resulting downtrend is not as dynamic as the two preceding moves,with alternating Impulse buy and sell signals. It is a sign of an indecisivemarket, which is hard to trade. If in doubt, stay out.\nAt the right edge of the chart, a triple bullish divergence of MACD-\nHistogram gives a buy signal. The Impulse System has just gone off itssell signal. The stock market appears poised for a rally. If you buy, witha stop below the latest low, make sure that order is stop-and-reverse. Ifthis bullish divergence gets aborted, the market will give a Hound of theBaskervilles signal and fall out of bed.\nTRADING 161\nExits\nWhen a cowboy at a rodeo hops on the back of a wild bronco, how\nlong does he ride it? Twenty seconds, 35 maybe, 50 if he is good andlucky. Wild momentum trades don’t last long either. Try to hop off whileyou’re still in the money.\nThe time to buy into a momentum trade is when all your ducks are\nin a row, that is, when the weekly trend is up and the daily EMA andMACD-Histogram are rising. Hop off as soon as a single indicatorturns down. Usually, daily MACD-Histogram turns first as the upsidemomentum starts weakening. When the buy signal disappears, sellwithout waiting for a sell signal.\nReverse the procedure in downtrends. A momentum trade on the\nshort side starts when the weekly trend turns down and the daily EMAand MACD-Histogram also fall, showing that the downward momen-tum is accelerating. Cover shorts as soon as one of those indicatorsstops giving a sell signal. The most dynamic part of the decline is over,and your momentum trade has fulfilled its goal.\nThe Impulse System encourages you to enter cautiously but exit fast.\nThis is the professional approach to trading, the total opposite of theamateurs’ style. Beginners jump into trades without thinking too muchand take forever to get out, hoping and waiting for the market to turntheir way.\nThe Impulse System, like Triple Screen, is a method of trading rather\nthan a mechanical system. It identifies islands of order in the oceanof market chaos by showing when the crowd, usually so aimless anddisorganized, becomes emotional and starts to run. You get in when itspattern emerges and hop off when it starts to sink back into chaos.\nTest the Impulse System on your own market data to answer several\nimportant questions. Should you enter and exit at the open, after see-ing the signal in the evening, or should you try to anticipate those sig-nals? What if you do your homework 15 minutes before the close andbuy or sell without waiting for tomorrow? Experiment with several dif-ferent parameters of the EMA and MACD-Histogram.\nYou must be very disciplined to trade this system because it is hard\nto place an order when the market is already flying, but even harderto quit while you’re ahead without waiting for a reversal. You are notallowed to kick yourself if the trend continues after you get out. Donot touch this system if you have the slightest problem with discipline.\nThe Impulse System can help you trade other systems. Check its\nmessage when Triple Screen gives you a signal to buy. If the ImpulseSystem flashes a sell signal, hold off buying; do not trade against it. Youwant to buy a dip, not a waterfall decline. Reverse the procedure indowntrends. Hold off shorting if the Impulse System flashes a buysignal. Such “negative rules,” designed to keep you out of trouble, areamong the most useful for serious traders.\nMARKET THERMOMETER\nA beginner needs to learn a battery of standard technical indicators andstart tweaking their parameters. Some traders create their own indica-tors to gauge different aspects of crowd behavior and identify marketmoves. Let us walk through the process of creating a new technical indi-cator and see how to go about building your own private indicators.\nAll good indicators reflect some aspect of market reality. Market\nThermometer helps differentiate between sleepy, quiet periods and hotepisodes when market crowds become excited. It can help you adaptyour trading to the current environment.\nQuiet markets typically have narrow bars that tend to overlap one\nanother. Hot, boiling markets tend to have wide bars whose highs andlows extend far outside the previous day’s range. Beginners jump intotrades during those wide bars, afraid to miss a runaway move. If youenter when the markets are quiet, your slippage is likely to be lower.Hot markets are good for taking profits because then slippage maywork in your favor.\nWhen gold recently ran up $40 in one week, a journalist asked a\nfamous investor whether it was a good buy. Gold was good, he said,but the time to get on this bus was when it stood in front of the sta-tion, and not rolling down the highway at 40 miles an hour. MarketThermometer helps you recognize when the bus slows down in frontof the station, picks up speed, or roars down the highway.\nMarket Thermometer measures how far the most extreme point of\ntoday, either high or low, protrudes outside of yesterday’s range. Thegreater the extension of today’s bar outside of yesterday’s, the higherthe market temperature. Here’s the formula of Market Thermometer:\nTemperature =the greater of either (High\ntoday−Highyesterday)\nor (Lowyesterday−Lowtoday)162 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTo program Market Thermometer into Windows on WallStreet soft-\nware, use the following formula:\nif (hi <ref(hi, −1) and lo >ref(lo, −1), 0, if ((hi −ref(hi, −1))>\n(ref(lo, −1)−lo), hi −ref(hi, −1), ref(lo, −1)−lo)).\nIt is easy to adapt this formula to other software packages.\nMarket temperature is always a positive number, reflecting the ab-\nsolute value of either the upward or the downward extension of yes-terday’s range, whichever is greater. Plot temperature as a histogram\nabove zero. Calculate a moving average of market temperature, and\nplot it as a line on the same chart. I use a 22-day EMA because thereare 22 trading days in a month, but feel free to experiment with shorterEMA values if you want to make this indicator more sensitive to short-term swings.\nWhen markets are quiet, the adjacent bars tend to overlap. The con-\nsensus of value is well established, and the crowd does little buyingor selling outside of yesterday’s range. When highs and lows exceedtheir previous day’s values, they do so only by small margins. MarketThermometer falls and its EMA slants down, indicating a sleepy market.\nWhen a market begins to run, either up or down, its daily bars start\npushing outside of the previous ranges. The histogram of Market Ther-mometer grows taller and crosses above its EMA, which soon turns up,confirming the new trend.\nMarket Thermometer gives four trading signals, based on the rela-\ntionship between its histogram and its moving average:\nThe best time to enter new positions is when Market Thermometer\nfalls below its moving average. When Market Thermometer falls below\nits EMA, it indicates that the market is quiet. If your system flashes anentry signal, try to enter when the market is cooler than usual. WhenMarket Thermometer rises above its moving average, it warns that themarket is hot and slippage more likely.\nExit positions when Market Thermometer rises to triple the height\nof its moving average. A spike of Market Thermometer indicates a\nrunaway move. When the crowd feels jarred by a sudden piece ofnews and surges, it is a good time to take profits. Panics tend to beshort-lived, of fering a brief opportunity to cash in. If the EMA of\nMarket Thermo meter stands at 5 cents, but the Thermometer itself\nshoots up to 15 cents, take profits. Test these values for the marketyou are trading.TRADING 163\nGet ready for an explosive move if the Thermometer stays below its\nmoving average for five to seven trading days. Quiet markets put ama-\nteurs to sleep. They become careless and stop watching prices. Volatilityand volume fall, and professionals get a chance to run away with themarket. Explosive moves often erupt from periods of inactivity.\nMarket Thermometer can help you set a profit target for the next\ntrading day. If you are a short-term trader and are long, add the value\nof today’s Thermometer EMA to yesterday’s high and place a sell orderthere. If you are short, subtract the value of the Thermometer’s EMAfrom yesterday’s low and place an order to cover at that level.\nI had two purposes in presenting the Market Thermometer. I wanted\nto give you a new indicator, but even more I wanted to show you howto use your understanding of the markets to design your own analytictools. Once you understand the principles of market analysis, you cancreate your own indicators. Use your knowledge, understanding, anddiscipline to get on the right side of the markets.164 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAC D F G\nBE\nFigure 6.7 Market Thermometer\nNvidia Corp (NVDA) is one of the current favorites among active traders.\nJust look at its many tradable features—a powerful rally to 100, its tripletop, a MACD bearish divergence, and a subsequent downtrend. Marketsoscillate between quiet and active periods, and the Thermometer helpsyou identify them.TEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nEXITING TRADES\nWhenever you enter a trade, three factors must be crystal clear in your\nmind—where to get in, where to take profits, and where to bail out incase of an emergency. Daydreaming about profits will not make yourich. You must decide in advance where you’ll take your winnings offthe table or cut and run if the market turns against you.\nBeginners keep looking for promising trades and assume that find-\ning them will make them money. They search for entries, while pro-fessionals spend a lot of time and energy planning their exits. Theyalways ask themselves where to take profits or cut losses. Survivorsknow the essential truth—you don’t get paid for entering trades, youget paid for exiting them.\nWhy think about an exit before you enter a trade? Isn’t it better to get\nin, monitor the trade, and exit in response to price action? There are twomain arguments for deciding on an exit before you enter a trade.TRADING 165\nAt point A, the stock is in an uptrend, while the Thermometer has been\nbelow its 22-day EMA for five days. This is a quiet before the storm. Anexplosive move in the direction of the trend (point B) rewards buyers. At thesame time a very high Thermometer reading, three times above the average,warns that the fun and games are over; the move is exhausted, and it is timeto take profits. At point C the Thermometer shrinks again, spending five daysbelow its EMA and warning that a sharp move is coming. Since prices areabove their EMA, expect a decline. A similar message emerges at point D.After the next rally (point E), an extremely high reading of the Thermometer,more than four times the average, warns that it is a good time to take short-term profits. Prices make a triple top near 100, MACD-Histogram traces asevere bearish divergence, and at points F and G prices hang flat. This isanother quiet before the storm as bears swing the stock down.\nThe EMA of the Thermometer tells you how far today’s high or low is\nlikely to be above or below yesterday’s extreme. This is a useful piece ofintelligence for those who like to buy low or sell high; you can place yourorder for the day near the projected extreme.\nAt the right edge of the chart, prices have just shot up to their declin-\ning EMA. They deserved a rally after sliding from 100 to below 70, but avery high reading of the Thermometer, three times above average, indi-cates that the excitement is overdone, a pause is coming, and the down-trend is about to resume.\nFirst, knowing your targets and stops allows you to weigh rewards\nand risks. If you have a clear signal to buy, with a price target of $2above and a stop $4 below, is that trade worth taking? Do you wantto risk $4 to gain $2? Price targets and stops prompt you to focus onlyon trades whose potential rewards far outweigh the risks. The ability towalkaway from a potential trade is as important as the ability to decline\na drink when you want.\nSecond, setting profit targets and stops before entering trades helps\nsidestep the pernicious “ownership effect.” We get attached to thingswe own and lose objectivity. That old ratty jacket hanging in yourcloset should have been given to the Salvation Army years ago. Thattrade you entered last week is starting to come apart at the seams. Whydon’t you chuck it? You own both the jacket and the trade; they feelcomfortable, familiar. That’s why you need to decide on exits beforeyou enter, before a trade becomes yours.\nA friend who is a top-notch technical analyst temporarily took a job\nas a broker after falling on hard times when his hedge fund closed.Naturally, I moved one of my accounts to him. Whenever I called toplace an order, he would not let me hang up unless I gave him a stop.Sometimes I’d plead for a little more time and he’d take my order, onthe condition that I call back within five minutes to give him a stop, orelse he would call me. Six months later he found work as a technicalanalyst, and I have never seen another broker like him since. He reallystressed the need to know your safety parameters before you took onmarket risk.\nBefore entering a trade, you should set two specific price levels, a\ntarget and a stop, one above and the other below current prices. Thisis all you need for a short-term trade, where you shoot at a clearly vis-ible target. You may find a broker who accepts OCO (one cancelsother) orders. Then, if your profit target is hit, the stop is automaticallycancelled, and vice versa. If your broker does not accept OCO orders,give him your stop and keep an eye on your profit target.\nWhat if you’re planning a fairly long-term trade that may last for sev-\neral days or even weeks? Profit targets shift with the passage of time,and protective stops need to be tightened as the trade moves in yourfavor. You must write down your rules for exiting trades and followthem from that piece of paper without arguing, haggling, or hoping fora better price. For example, you may decide to exit if the upper chan-nel line gets hit or if the market makes lower lows for two days in a166 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nrow. Whatever rules you use, write them down and execute immedi-\nately once the market hits a profit target or a stop-loss level in accor-dance with your rules.\nVery experienced traders know how to recognize unusually forceful\ntrends, during which they shift exit strategies, take partial profits, andcarry the balance of their positions with a modified exit strategy forrunaway trends. As you become more experienced, you can become alittle more relaxed with your plans, but a beginning or an intermediatetrader must be very strict. Entries are easy because any clown can buya lottery ticket, but exits separate winners from losers.\nChannel Targets\nTraders all over the world squint at their charts, trying to recognize pat-terns, and let their imaginations run wild. Statistical studies, however,consistently confirm only one pattern—the tendency of prices to fluctu-ate above and below value. Markets may be chaotic most of the time,but their overbought and oversold conditions create islands of order thatprovide some of the best trading opportunities. Markets swing betweenelation and despair, and we can make money from those moods.\nChannels are technical tools that help us take advantage of market\nswings. We draw them parallel to the moving average in the inter-mediate timeframe, usually daily. A well-drawn channel contains ap-proximately 95% of recent prices. Its upper line represents the manicand the lower line the depressive moods of the market.\nIf we buy value near a rising moving average, we can sell mania in\nthe vicinity of the upper channel line. If we go short near a falling mov-ing average, we can cover at the depressed level near the lower chan-nel line. Channels provide attractive targets for profit taking.\nPeople say that a neurotic is a person who builds castles in the\nclouds, a psychotic lives in them, and a psychiatrist is the fellow whocollects the rent. Channels help us collect rent from what drives mostinvestors crazy—the relentless swings of the markets. The idea is to buynormalcy and sell mania or go short normalcy and cover depression.\nStraight channels or envelopes work better for profit taking than\nstandard deviation channels, or Bollinger bands. Those bands grow widewhen volatility rises and narrow when it declines. They help optionstraders, who depend heavily on volatility, but those of us who tradestocks or futures are better off with straight channels.TRADING 167\nChannels are for traders, not investors. If you want to invest in a $10\nstock and ride it to $50, channels are not for you. Exits from invest-ments or very long-term trades are based on the fundamentals or suchlong-term technical signals as the reversals of a 26-week moving aver-age. Envelopes or channels work best when you trade relatively short-term swings between undervalued and overvalued levels.\nIf you buy near a rising EMA, place a sell order where you expect\nthe upper channel line to be tomorrow. If the upper channel line hasbeen rising a half a point a day for the past few days and closed at 88today, then you can place a sell order at 88.50 for tomorrow. Adjustthis number every day as the channel moves higher or lower.\nWhenever I teach a group how to use channels for profit taking,\nsomeone raises a hand and points to an area where prices overshottheir channel. Taking profits at that channel line would have caused usto miss a large part of a rally. What can I say? This system is good butnot perfect. No method, except for hindsight, nails down all tops andbottoms. Robert Prechter, who used to be a famous market analyst, putit well when he said, “Traders take a good system and destroy it by try-ing to make it into a perfect system.”\nIf a trend is very strong, you may want to ride swings a little farther.\nSell half of your position when prices hit the upper channel line, butuse your judgment to dance out of the second half. You may monitorintraday prices and sell on the first day when they do not make a newhigh. Use your judgment and skills, but do yourself a favor—give upthe idea of nailing tops. Greed is a very expensive emotion.\nIf a rally is weak, prices may begin to sink without reaching their upper\nchannel line. There is no law that says the market must become manicbefore returning to value. Force Index can help measure the strength ofa rally. When the two-day Force Index rises to a new high, it confirmsthe power of bulls and encourages you to hold until prices hit the upperchannel line. If the two-day Force Index traces a bearish divergence, itshows that the rally is weak and you better grab profits fast.\nAn A trader is someone who takes 30% or more out of a channel.\nThat is a little more than half the distance from the moving average tothe channel line. Even if you buy slightly above the moving averageand sell below its upper channel line, you can be an A trader and profithandsomely. Channels help catch normal tops and bottoms, and youcan become very rich by steadily raking in normal profits. Channelshelp set up realistic profit targets.168 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nProtective Stops\nAmateurs swing between fantasy and reality, making most decisions in\nthe realm of fantasy. They dream of profits and avoid unpleasantthoughts about possible losses. Since stops force us to focus on losses,most traders resist using them.\nA friend told me she needed no stops because she was an investor.\n“At what price did you buy that stock?” I asked. She had gotten in at 80and now it was at 85. “Would you still hold it if it fell back to 80?” Shesaid she would. “What about 75?” She said she would probably buy more.“What about 70?” She winced. “What about 55? Would you still want toown it?” No, no, she vigorously shook her head. “Well, then you needa stop somewhere above 55!”\nI recently had dinner with a lawyer who obtained inside information\nthat a certain penny-stock company was about to announce a strategicpartnership with a telecom giant. Questions of legality and moralityaside, he put most of his money into that stock at an average price of16.5 cents a share. Once the announcement came out, his stock ran upto $8, but by the time he told me his secret over a tray of sushi, it wasdown to $1.50. He had no stop. I asked him whether he would con-tinue to hold if his stock slid to 8 cents, half of what he paid. He wasshocked and promised to put in a stop at $1. Did he do it? Probablynot. It is easier to dream and close one’s eyes to reality.\nYou must put in a stop immediately after entering a trade and start\nmoving it in the direction of that trade as soon as it starts moving inyour favor. Stops are a one-way street. When long, you may raise, butnever lower them. When short, you may lower but never raise them.Only losers say, “I’ll give this trade a little more room.” You alreadygave it all the room it needed when you placed your stop! If a stockstarts moving against you, leave your stop alone! You were morerational at the time you placed it than you are today, with prices hov-ering and threatening to hit it.\nInvestors must reevaluate their stops once every few weeks, but\ntraders have a harder job. We must recalculate our stops every day andmove them often.\nA Deadly Delusion Many traders think they can stay out of trouble\nwithout using stops, thanks to their superior market analysis. Trading is\na high-wire act. You may walk that wire a hundred times without a safetyTRADING 169\nnet, but the very first fall can cripple you. You cannot afford to take that\nchance. No amount of brains will help you if you abandon stops.\nSeveral years ago I got a call from a world-famous developer of trad-\ning software. He invited me on a camping trip, and mentioned in pass-ing that he had developed a fantastic system for trading futures. It wasbased on computerized pattern recognition, backtested on 20 years ofdata with breathtaking results. He had no money to trade that system,having lost his capital on an earlier venture, but showed his discoveryto a group of money managers. They were so impressed they began toset up a hedge fund for him, and in the meantime gave him what theycalled a small account—$100,000.\nI flew across the country and spent the first evening admiring my\nfriend’s system. “Are you trading anything now?” The system had givenhim six signals: in soybeans, Swiss francs, pork bellies, and three othermarkets. He had entered trades in all six. “How much did you allocateto each?” He had divided his account into six parts, one for eachmarket. No reserves. Fully margined. “Where did you put your stops?”He told me in so many words that real men didn’t use stops.\nHe had mathematical proof that stops lowered profitability. Safety\nlay in trading unrelated markets. If one or two went against him, otherswould move in his favor. “What about a catastrophic event, with all mar-kets moving against you?” He assured me that was impossible becausehe traded unrelated markets, and there was no correlation between Swiss\nfrancs and pork bellies. Furthermore, his system had not a single wipe-out in 20 years of backtesting.\nI suggested we forget about camping and stay closer to the screen,\nsince his entire capital was at risk. My friend insisted he had total con-fidence in his system, and so we drove to the Sierra Nevada, some ofthe most breathtaking scenery in America. We had a grand time, andon the last day my son, who was about 8 at the time, hauled in a plas-tic pail full of gold nuggets. It was fool’s gold, of course, but to thisday I keep one of them on my desk as a paperweight, engraved “Allthat glitters is gold.”\nBy the time we returned to civilization the impossible had hap-\npened. All six markets went against my friend, nearly wiping out hisequity. The next morning we watched in horror as the markets openedone after another, continuing to go against him in huge gobs. I talkedhim into closing two out of six positions, but then it was time to driveto the airport.170 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nA few days later I called to thank my friend for the trip. His account\nwas wiped out, and he bitterly complained that his money men weren’tgentlemen; they weren’t returning his phone calls. I resisted thetemptation to say that if he lost $100,000 for me, I would not returnhis phone calls either.\nA trader who doesn’t use stops will eventually take the mother of all\nlosses. Spectacular disasters hit brilliant individuals who believe thattheir general sharpness and great systems override the need for stops.A careless trader can get away with no stops for a while, but if he tradeslong enough the market will kill him.\nNo amount of brains will save a trader who doesn’t use stops. A\nNobel Prize for research in the financial markets will not help him.Look at Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund owned andoperated by a clutch of certified geniuses, including a former Salomon\ndirector, a former Fed governor, and two Nobel Prize winners. Thosepeople were too bright to use stops. They came to the brink of failurein 1998 and didn’t bust out only because the US Federal Reservestepped in to arrange a bailout to avoid disrupting world markets.\nNo amount of intelligence, knowledge, or computer power will save\nyou from a disaster if you trade without stops. Stops are essential foryour survival and success.\nWhat about mental stops—deciding on your exit point and then\nwatching the market? If it violates that level, you exit your position, try-ing to get the best price. This is a common strategy among pros whohave a lot of experience and iron discipline. A beginner, on the otherhand, watches the market the way a rabbit watches a snake—frozen infear, unable to move. He must place actual stops.\nStops do not provide total protection because prices are not con-\ntinuous and can gap across the stop level. You can buy a stock at 40and place a protective stop at 37, but a bad earnings report or anannouncement can force that stock to open at 34 tomorrow, filling yourorder at a much worse level than expected. This is not an argumentagainst stops. An umbrella with holes is better than no umbrella at all.Also, money management rules provide an extra level of protection.\nStops in Two Dimensions Placing stops is one of the hardest chal-\nlenges in trading, more so than finding good trades. You want to placethem close enough to protect your capital but far enough to avoidbeing stopped out by meaningless noise. It is a delicate balancing act.TRADING 171\nMost trading books repeat the same advice: place a stop below the\nlatest low when long or above the latest high when short. This methodis so simple and common that tons of stops become bunched up atthe same obvious levels. Professionals are not blind; they look at chartsand know where those stops are. They gun for them, trying to triggerstops with false breakouts.\nWhen a stock hangs just above support, the inflow of fresh buy\norders dries up, and those with stops below support just suck air andwait. The pros sell short, giving that stock a bit of a push. It stumblesbelow support, setting off a flurry of sell stop orders. The pros whoshorted at a higher level begin to cover, buying on the cheap fromamateurs whose stops they hit. As soon as the decline slows down theyredouble their buying, and go long. The market rallies, and the proswho bought below support now sell into the rally. Most breakoutsfrom trading ranges are false breakouts—fishing expeditions by thepros gunning for stops at common levels. Once those stops are cleanedout, the market is ready to reverse. Most traders become so disgustedafter getting hit by several false breakouts that they give up using stops.That’s when a real reversal catches them. They end up losing money,with and without stops, and wash out of the markets.\nPlacing stops at obvious levels is not a good idea. You are better off\nplacing them a bit closer to protect capital or a bit farther to reduce therisk of getting hit. Try not to do what everybody else does. Be sure toplace your stop where you do not expect the market to go. If youexpect prices to fall to a certain level, why place a stop there? You’rebetter off closing your trade without waiting.\nThere are two inputs into placing stops: technical analysis and\nmoney management. You can combine them to find the right size foryour trade as well as the right place for your stop. The first step is todecide how many dollars you should risk on the trade you’re aboutto take. Later, in the section on money management, you’ll learn tolimit your risk on any trade to a tiny percentage of your account. Ifyou’re not fully confident, risk an even smaller percentage. Once youhave the dollar figure for your maximum risk, turn to technical ana-lysis to find where to place your stop. A stop based on technicalanalysis is almost always tighter, that is, closer to the market, thanthe money management stop. Your account is now starting to look likea submarine with a double hull—softer on the outside and harder onthe inside.172 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nYour money management stops belong in the market. They repre-\nsent your maximum allowable risk level, which you may not violateunder any circumstances. If your technical analysis stops are closer tothe market, you may hold them in your mind as you monitor pricesand are prepared to exit if those levels gets hit.\nHere, I want to share with you two advanced methods for placing\nstops. Try to program them into your software and test them on yourmarket data. Until now, I have never disclosed SafeZone to traders,except to small groups in Traders’ Camps, where I like to share mylatest research. It is my principle not to withhold information frommy books. I write as I trade and maintain my edge not by secrecy butby developing new methods.\nThe SafeZone Stop\nOnce in a trade, where should you put your stop? This is one of thehardest questions in technical analysis. After answering it, you’ll facean even harder one—when and where to move that stop with the pas-sage of time. Put a stop too close and it’ll get whacked by some mean-ingless intraday swing. Put it too far, and you’ll have very skimpyprotection.\nThe Parabolic System, described in Trading for a Living , tried to\ntackle this problem by moving stops closer to the market each day,accelerating whenever a stock or a commodity reached a new extreme.The trouble with Parabolic was that it kept moving even if the marketstayed flat and often got hit by meaningless noise.\nThe concept of signal and noise states that the trend is the signal and\nthe nontrending motion is the noise. A stock or a future may be in anuptrend or a downtrend, but the noise of its random chop can obscureits signal. Trading at the right edge is hard because the noise level is high.I developed SafeZone to trail prices with stops tight enough to protectcapital but remote enough to keep clear of most random fluctuations.\nEngineers design filters to suppress noise and allow the signal to come\nthrough. If the trend is the signal, then the countertrend motion is thenoise. When the trend is up, we can define noise as that part of eachday’s range that protrudes below the previous day’s low. When the trendis down, we can define noise as that part of each day’s range that pro-trudes above the previous day’s high. SafeZone measures market noiseand places stops at a multiple of noise level away from the market.TRADING 173\nWe may use the slope of a 22-day EMA to define the trend. You need\nto choose the length of the lookback period for measuring noise level.It has to be long enough to track recent behavior but short enough tobe relevant for current trading. A period of 10 to 20 days works well,or we can make our lookback period 100 days or so if we want to aver-age long-term market behavior.\nIf the trend is up, mark all downside penetrations during the look-\nback period, add their depths, and divide the sum by the number ofpenetrations. This gives you the Average Downside Penetration for theselected lookback period. It reflects the average level of noise in thecurrent uptrend. Placing your stop any closer would be self-defeating.We want to place our stops farther away from the market than theaverage level of noise. Multiply the Average Downside Penetration bya coefficient, starting with two, but experiment with higher numbers.Subtract the result from yesterday’s low, and place your stop there. Iftoday’s low is lower than yesterday’s, do not move your stop lower sincewe are only allowed to raise stops on long positions, not lower them.\nReverse these rules in downtrends. When a 22-day EMA identifies a\ndowntrend, count all the upside penetrations during the lookbackperiod and find the Average Upside Penetration. Multiply it by a co-efficient, starting with two. When you go short, place a stop twice theAverage Upside Penetration above the previous day’s high. Lower yourstop whenever the market makes a lower high, but never raise it.\nI anticipate that SafeZone will be programmed into many software\npackages, allowing traders to control both the lookback period and themultiplication factor. Until then, you will have to do your own pro-gramming or else track SafeZone manually (see Table 6.1). Be sure tocalculate it separately for uptrends and downtrends.\nHere are the rules for calculating SafeZone using an Excel spread-\nsheet. Once you understand how it works, try to program SafeZoneinto your technical analysis software and superimpose its signals on thechart. Compare the numbers from the spreadsheet and the trading soft-ware. They should be identical; otherwise, you have a programmingerror. Comparing results from two software packages helps overcomepesky programming problems.\nRules for Longs in Uptrends When the trend is up, we calculate\nSafeZone on the basis of the lows because their pattern determinesstop placement.174 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nABCDE FG HI J K LM N O PQ R\n1IBM For uptrends For downtrends\n2Date High Low Close Dn Sum Pen Dn Dn Short Pr otected Up Sum Pen Up Up Long Protected\nPen Y/N numb Avg Stop Pen Y/N numb avg Stop\n304/19 115.90 110.30 114.47\n404/20 116.40 113.75 114.83 0 0 0.5 1\n504/23 114.05 111.68 112.00 2.07 1 0 0\n604/24 114.75 112.28 112.67 0 0 0.7 1\n704/25 114.85 111.99 114.85 0.29 1 0.1 1\n804/26 116.70 113.68 113.74 0 0 1.85 1\n904/27 116.90 114.55 116.20 0 0 0.2 1\n10 04/30 118.05 114.72 115.14 0 0 1.15 1\n11 05/01 118.65 114.90 118.51 0 0 0.6 1\n12 05/02 118.95 113.74 115.40 1.16 1 0.3 1\n13 05/03 115.10 112.35 113.70 1.39 4.91 1 4 1.23 0 5.4 0 8 0.68\n14 05/04 115.86 111.20 115.86 1.15 6.06 1 5 1.21 109.90 0.76 5.66 1 8 0.71 116.45\n15 05/07 117.25 115.00 115.90 0 3.99 0 4 1.00 108.78 1.39 7.05 1 9 0.78 117.28\n16 05/08 117.75 115.50 117.70 0 3.99 0 4 1.00 113.01 113.01 0.5 6.85 1 9 0.76 118.82 116.45\n17 05/09 118.18 115.30 116.98 0.2 3.9 1 4 0.98 113.51 113.51 0.43 7.18 1 9 0.80 119.27 117.28\n18 05/10 118.90 115.20 115.20 0.1 4 1 5 0.80 113.35 113.51 0.72 6.05 1 9 0.67 119.78 118.82\n19 05/11 114.15 110.96 111.81 4.24 8.24 1 6 1.37 113.60 113.60 0 5.85 0 8 0.73 120.24 119.27\n20 05/14 113.18 111.00 112.56 0 8.24 0 6 1.37 108.21 113.60 0 4.7 0 7 0.67 115.61 115.61\n21 05/15 114.15 112.50 113.58 0 8.24 0 6 1.37 108.25 113.60 0.97 5.07 1 7 0.72 114.52 114.52\n22 05/16 115.80 112.20 115.80 0.3 7.38 1 6 1.23 109.75 109.75 1.65 6.42 1 7 0.92 115.60 114.52\n23 05/17 117.09 113.36 115.07 0 5.99 0 5 1.20 109.74 109.75 1.29 7.71 1 8 0.96 117.63 114.52\n24 05/18 117.68 114.90 117.44 0 4.84 0 4 1.21 110.96 110.96 0.59 7.54 1 8 0.94 119.02 115.60\n25 05/21 119.90 117.55 119.04 0 4.84 0 4 1.21 112.48 112.48 2.22 8.37 1 8 1.05 119.57 117.63\n26 05/22 119.70 117.05 118.01 0.5 5.34 1 5 1.07 115.13 115.13 0 7.87 0 7 1.12 121.99 119.02\n27 05/23 118.95 117.10 117.40 0 5.14 0 4 1.29 114.91 115.13 0 7.44 0 6 1.24 121.95 119.57Table 6.1 SafeZone Stops—Spreadsheet\n175\n1.Obtain at least a month of data for your stock or future in high-\nlow-close format, as shown in Table 6.1 (lows are in column Cwith the first record in row 3).\n2.Test whether today’s low is lower than yesterday’s.

Putting your stopcloser than the average level of noise means asking for trouble, and eventwice the average level is often too close. Once your system identifies anuptrend, SafeZone starts following prices, getting you out before the trendreverses. You can see that SafeZone stop was hit at points A, B, C, and D,catching the bulk of the uptrend and avoiding downdrafts.\nThe right edge of the chart illustrates why it is a good idea never to\nhold a stock below its SafeZone level. JEC is in a free fall, wiping out theprofits of a month in just two days—a trader using SafeZone cashed outearly in the decline.\nSafeZone offers an original approach to placing stops. It monitors\nchanges in prices and adapts stops to the current levels of activity. Itplaces stops at individually tailored distances rather than at obvioussupport and resistance levels.\nSafeZone works on the way down just as well as on the way up.\nHere we count each upside penetration of the previous day’s rangeduring a selected time window and average that data to find theAverage Upside Penetration. We multiply it by a coefficient, startingwith 3, and add that to the high of each bar.\nLike all systems and indicators in this book, SafeZone is not a mechan-\nical gadget to replace independent thought. You have to establish thelookback period, the window of time during which SafeZone is calcu-lated. Do not go back beyond the last important turning point. If themarket has reversed from down to up two weeks ago, then SafeZone forthe current long trades should not look back more than 10 trading days.TRADING 179\nA\nFigure 6.9 SafeZone Stops—Downtrend\nOnce your system identifies a downtrend, SafeZone helps you ride your\nshort position all the way down, covering before a rally starts eating intoyour profits. Notice how SafeZone rode the decline in FCEL, constantlylowering its stop, until taken out by a rally at point A.\nAt the right edge of the chart, the downtrend continues, with SafeZone\nprotecting a short position. It is safe to hold shorts with a close stop.\nAnother important decision is choosing the coefficient for the SafeZone\nstop. Usually, a coefficient between two and three provides a marginof safety, but you must research it on your own market data. Once youhave done your homework and tweaked this indicator, it will becomeyour own private tool in the battle for survival and success in the markets.You can add it to almost any trading system, including Triple Screen.\nThe Chandelier Exit\nWhen a trend speeds up, you may want to shift gears and ride itinstead of trading swings. Catching swings calls for tight stops, but alonger-term position demands more breathing room. The ChandelierExit is designed to protect such positions.\nWhen buyers place stops, they usually count back from the lows and\nput stops below recent important bottoms. When traders go short, theyusually count back from the highs and place stops above the recent peaks.The Chandelier Exit takes a different approach. When traders are long,it hangs their stops from the highest peak reached by that trend, like achandelier hangs from the tallest point in the room. As prices move up,the Chandelier Exit, suspended from the highest point of that trend, alsorises. It tracks volatility as well as prices, as its distance from the peakgrows with the rise in volatility. We will review Chandelier Exits for up-trends, but you may reverse these rules and apply them to downtrends.\nThere is no telling how high a trend may go, and a Chandelier will\nrise until prices peel off from the ceiling and hit that stop. This method,along with several others, was presented by Chuck LeBeau in ourTraders’ Camp in January 2000 in the Caribbean and again in March2001 in the Pacific.\nThe Chandelier Exit draws on the concept of Average True Range,\ndescribed by Welles Wilder in 1966. The True Range is the greatestof the three figures—the distance between today’s high and low, ortoday’s high and yesterday’s close, or today’s low and yesterday’sclose. The True Range reflects overnight volatility by comparing today’sand yesterday’s prices.\nThe True Range is included in many software packages. The Average\nTrue Range (ATR) is obtained by averaging True Range over a periodof time. How long a period? You can begin by looking back a month,but a modern computerized trader can easily test different lookbackperiods for Average True Range.180 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThe Chandelier Exit subtracts the Average True Range, multiplied by\na coefficient, from the highest point reached by the trend. Its formula is:\nChandelier =HP−coef •ATR\nwhere\nChandelier =the Chandelier Exit\nHP =the highest point for a selected number of days\ncoef =the coefficient, selected by the trader\nATR =Average True Range for a selected number of days\nIf an uptrend is boiling and daily ranges are wide, then stops fall a\nlittle farther away. If the uptrend is quiet and calm with more narrowranges, the stops inch a little closer.\nIn Windows on Wallstreet software, the formula for the Chandelier\nExit is:\nHhv(hi, 22) −3\n•ATR(22)\nHhv(hi, 22) is the highest high reached in the past 22 days and\nATR(22) is the Average True Range for the past 22 days. Try to test otherparameters in the markets you like to trade.\nThis formula multiplies the Average True Range by three before sub-\ntracting it from the high of the past 22 trading days. A serious trader ispassionate about his research. Such a person will immediately noticethat this formula contains three variables—the length of the lookbackperiod for the highest high, the length of the lookback period for theTrue Range, and the coefficient for multiplying Average True Range. Itprobably doesn’t pay to fiddle with the first variable, as the highesthigh in a runaway uptrend is likely to be close to the right edge andmost lookback periods catch it. The Average True Range is only slightlymore sensitive to the length of its lookback period. A more fertileground for experimenting is the ATR coefficient. If everyone has theirstops at 3 ATRs below the peak, wouldn’t you like to see what hap-pens if you set your stop at 3.5 or 2.5?\nThe Chandelier Exit can be used to trail profits on short positions in\nrunaway downtrends. There the formula becomes:\nLlv(lo, 22) +3\n•ATR(22)\nLlv(lo, 22) is the lowest low reached in the past 22 days and ATR(22)\nis the True Range for the past 22 days.TRADING 181\nExperienced traders sometimes joke that bear markets have no sup-\nport and bull markets no resistance. A runaway trend can overshoot allrational expectations. The Chandelier deals with that by tying its stopsto the price extreme as well as volatility.\nThe negative side of Chandelier Exits is that they give up a great deal\nof profit. Three Average True Ranges can amount to a lot of money ina volatile market. A beginning trader is better off taking his profits atthe channel wall. A more advanced trader whose market is hitting itschannel wall while showing great strength is more likely to switch toa Chandelier Exit. If he holds a large position, he may take partial prof-its at the channel wall and carry the rest using the Chandelier. TheChandelier Exit may act a backup exit strategy for experienced traders.\nGamblers lose fortunes trying to nail tops and bottoms. A good trader\nis a realist who wants to grab a chunk from the body of a trend, leaving182 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nABC\nFigure 6.10 The Chandelier Exit\nIn an uptrend, the Chandelier Exit hangs from its uppermost point, 3\nAverage True Ranges below the extreme. It does a good job of helpingcatch the bulk of the uptrend, stopping traders out and protecting profitsat points A, B, and C. Notice that as volatility increases the Chandeliergives a stock a little wider stop, receding from prices.\nAt the right edge of the chart, the Chandelier Exit has taken profits just\nas the decline got under way. Wait until your system gives you a new buysignal, and when it does, hang a new Chandelier on that trend.\ntop- and bottom-fishing to people on an ego trip. The Chandelier Exit\nhelps take care of that chunk.\nCHOOSING WHAT TO TRADE\nOpen a newspaper, and thousands of listings leap at you from thepages—stocks, mutual funds, futures, options, bonds, currencies. Yourdata provider may offer a menu of 20,000 items or more. Were you todownload and review all of them, spending just two seconds on each,that process would take 11 hours.\nBeginners worry about missing opportunities and try to look at as\nmany markets as possible. They often ask for advice on scanning soft-ware. They want to sift through thousands of stocks for somethinglike a bullish divergence in MACD-Histogram. First of all, divergences,so visible to the naked eye, are notoriously hard to program. The bestprogrammer I know tells me he’s done it—it is the pinnacle of hissuccess—using the most expensive software. Even if a beginner couldget hold of his program, that expense would be wasted because hewouldn’t know what to do with the stocks he found in that search.He wouldn’t know how to trade them correctly. A beginner is betteroff focusing on a handful of markets, learning all about them, and trad-ing them with care and attention.\nYou are better off limiting yourself to as many markets as you can\nrealistically follow each day. Professionals study their markets daily todetect transitions from sleepy trading ranges to new trends. The besttime to profit from a trend is before it becomes overpriced and volatile.\nMarkets that make headlines tend to be overpriced and volatile. If\nyou read an article on the front page of a financial newspaper abouta bull market in biotech stocks or see a report on the evening newsabout the high price of coffee, those trends are probably nearer theend than the beginning, and buying biotech stocks or coffee futures isprobably very dangerous.\nTo understand a person or a group, it pays to know what they want\nand what they fear. Journalists and editors most fear making a mistakethat will make them look foolish. They report trends only after anyonecan see them because that way there is no mistake. Even if they knewhow to catch trends early, which they don’t, they wouldn’t dare printtheir findings for fear of being wrong and appearing ignorant. Tradersaren’t afraid of mistakes as long as they use money management, butjournalists cannot afford such risks. By the time they write up a trend,TRADING 183\nit has been going on for a while, volatility is high, risk management is\ndifficult, and a major reversal is probably in the cards.\nShould you trade stocks or futures, currencies or options? Options\nare rough for beginners, who should learn to trade the underlying secu-rities first, whether stocks or futures. People outside the United Statesare often drawn to currencies, forgetting that those are truly globalmarkets, and when you trade them, you go against banks that havetraders in all time zones. The choice between stocks or futures is sel-dom made on a rational basis. Trading stocks seems more respectable,while futures have more of a swashbuckling reputation. Futures gettheir wild image from their enormous leverage. If you scrupulouslyobserve money management rules, they become much safer and lessnerve-racking.\nStocks\nStocks tend to move more slowly than futures, thus reducing risks forbeginners, especially those who avoid margin. It is one of the mysteriesof markets that cash traders are more likely to win, and margin tradersto lose. Why? Interest rates on margin loans are a serious expense, rais-ing a barrier to winning, but there’s more. People who buy stocks forcash tend to feel more relaxed, buying as much or as little as theywant. Margin traders are more likely to feel stressed. An anxious traderis a troubled trader. It is better to buy only what you can afford, pol-ish your skills, and the money will follow.\nThe sheer number of stocks drives people to distraction. Beginners\nthrow their arms in the air and beg for a list of stocks to follow. A dis-ciplined trader makes several choices that help him concentrate. Hebegins by selecting an industry group or groups and then zeros in onindividual stocks.\nA beginner should start with one or two groups, an intermediate\ntrader can go up to four or five, and an expert knows how many hecan handle. Chances are, he sticks to the few groups he knows well.Begin by choosing a group that you think has a great future or one inwhich you have a personal interest. For example, you may decide toconcentrate on biotechnology because of its promise or the hospitalityindustry because that’s where you work.\nSelect a broad rather than a narrow group. For example, if you\ndecide to track autos, look not just at car manufacturers, but also atcompanies that make auto parts, tires, etc. The disadvantage of focusing184 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\non a single group is that you miss spectacular moves in others, but\nthere are several advantages. You learn which stocks tend to lead orfollow. When leaders start to move, they give you an advance signalto trade the laggards. You can use relative strength, that is, buy thestrongest stocks when the group moves up and short the weakest onthe way down. You can create an index that includes all the stocks youfollow in your industry group, and then analyze that index. This ana-lytic tool is not available to any other trader. If you use fundamentalanalysis, then having your finger on the pulse of a single industry, suchas software, puts you miles ahead of competitors who trade Microsofttoday and McDonald’s tomorrow.\nA broadly defined industry group may include over a hundred stocks,\nbut an intelligent beginner should not follow more than a dozen. Wecan divide all stocks into blue chips and speculative “cats and dogs.”Blue chips are the stocks of large, well-established companies, held bymany institutions and followed by many researchers. They have a fairlywell-established consensus of value around which they more or less\ngently oscillate. If you design a system for catching their sw ings\nseveral times each year, the potential gains can be very attractive. Don’tignore the big Dow-type stocks. Their orderly swings from the movingaverage to the channel wall create good trading opportunities.\nThe so-called cats and dogs may spend months, if not years, flat at the\nbottom, in a speculative doghouse, until a fundamental change, or evena rumor of change, propels them to a breakout and a new uptrend.Other cats and dogs may go nowhere or expire. Those stocks offer muchhigher percentage gains than blue chips, but the risks are greater andyou must spend a great deal of time waiting for them to move. It makessense to trade a large portion of your account in blue chips, while keep-ing a smaller portion in longer-term speculative positions.\nWhat if you’ve paid your dues, learned to trade a few stocks in a\nfew groups, and now want to forage in wider pastures? After all, tech-nical patterns and signals are not all that different in various markets.What if you want to scan a larger number of stocks for MACD diver-gences, Impulse breakouts, or other patterns that you learned to recog-nize, trust, and trade?\nGo on the Internet and find a website that gives you the 100 most\nactive stocks on the NASDAQ (and if you do not know how to findsuch a website, you haven’t got what it takes to trade them). Keepan eye on any stock that floats by you. A newspaper article mentionsseveral companies—look up their stocks. People at a party talk aboutTRADING 185\nstocks—jot them down, drop them into your system, and see how\nthey look on your screen. Many tips call for an exercise of contrarythinking. In summer 2001, Lucent (LU) was in the news with anotherearnings disappointment, having slid from 80 to 6. The journalistswere aghast, but that stock has completed its bear market, traced anattractive bullish divergence, and was poised for a rally. A rise from 6to 9 is a 50% increase. Stocks that people tout at parties are often goodcandidates for shorting. By the time outsiders become interested, therise tends to be over. The idea is to maintain your curiosity and usetips not on their face value but only as invitations to look at this orthat stock. I find that my yield, the percentage of tips that I end uptrading in either direction, is about 5%—I end up trading one out of 20.I have a friend, a brilliant trader, who often calls me asking to take alook at this or that stock. My yield on her tips is 10%—she is the best.\nThe Turnover Ratio The Turnover Ratio (TRO) predicts expected\nvolatility of any stock by comparing its average daily volume with theavailable float. This formula was brought to my attention by Roger PerryofThe RightLine Report (www.rightline.net):\nTRO =monthly volume divided by the available float\nVolume for the past month is easy to calculate. The available float refers\nto the total float, or number of shares issued, minus the holdings of insti-tutions and insiders. Those groups tend to hold positions more tightlythan private traders, who are more likely to sell if the price is right. Allof the above figures are widely available from financial databases.\nYou can calculate the average monthly volume by multiplying the\ndaily volume by 22, the number of trading days in a month. Usingthe daily volume makes the TRO more responsive to changes in volumeas a stock rolls into or out of favor with traders.\nTRO shows how many times the float trades in a month. For exam-\nple, if a stock’s monthly volume is 200 million shares and its availablefloat 100 million, its TRO is 2%. If monthly volume of another stock isalso 200 million, but its available float is 50 million, its TRO is 4.\nIf the average volume is much lower than the float, that stock has a\nlow turnover rate and an onrush of buyers is unlikely to move theprice much. However, if the volume is high relative to the float, thena lot of people compete for few available shares, and a sudden rush ofbuyers can move the price dramatically. 186 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nHigh-TRO stocks tend to be more volatile. Whoever wants to buy\nthem has to pay a premium to pry them out of the hands of relativelyfew holders. When a selling wave hits the markets, the stocks with highTROs tend to go down harder because they do not have a large poolof institutional holders looking to pick up extra shares at a discount.All other factors being equal, the stock with a higher TRO will make abigger percentage move.\nFor example, at the time of this writing, the monthly volume in GE\nwas 355.9 million, with the available float of 9,809 million, resulting ina turnover ratio of 4%. The figures for JNPR were 387.2 million, 155.6million, and 249%. No wonder; GE is a slow-moving blue chip, whereasJNPR is a high-flyer. Check these numbers once a month, as they keepchanging. Stock splits reduce TROs by increasing the float. One splittoo many in DELL has oversaturated the market to the point where thestock has become unattractive for day-traders.\nBlue chips, such as General Electric and IBM, are widely held by\ninstitutions and individuals. Their daily volume, no matter how high, isbut a tiny percentage of their float. New unseasoned stocks often havevery small floats, but when they catch the public’s eye, their daily vol-umes go sky-high, lifting the TRO.\nYou can keep close tabs on the TROs of stocks you track. Whenever\nthe market is active and running, switch into high-TRO stocks. When-ever the market goes into a choppy stage, switch to low-TRO stocksand trade their swings. TRO can help you switch between aggressiveand defensive positions.\nTrading Swings or Trends Whenever you glance at a chart, your eye\nis immediately drawn to major rallies and declines. Big moves attractus with their promise of a killing. Exactly who gets killed is a questionthat seldom crosses beginners’ minds. The trouble with major ralliesand declines is that they are clearly visible in the middle of the chart,but the closer you get to the right edge, the murkier they become.\nBig uptrends are punctuated by drops, while downtrends are inter-\nrupted by rallies. Emotionally, it is extremely hard to hold a positionthrough a countertrend move. As profits melt away, we begin to won-der whether this is a temporary interruption or a full-blown reversal.There is a strong temptation to grab what little money is left and run.Shorter swings are easier to catch because price targets are closer andstops are tighter.TRADING 187\nShould you trade long-term trends or short-term swings? Be sure to\ndecide before you put on a trade; it is easier to be objective when nomoney is at risk. Different stocks have different personalities, which iswhy trend traders and swing traders tend to follow different stocks.\nTraders have three choices. Trend traders identify major trends\nwhich run for months. Swing traders catch short-term swings betweenoptimism and pessimism, which last from a few days to a few weeks.Day-traders enter and exit during the same trading session, with tradeslasting only minutes or hours.\nSuccessful trend trades that catch large moves bring in more money\nper trade. Other advantages include having more time to decide whento enter or exit, not being tied to the screen, and having the emotionalsatisfaction of calling major moves. Trend trading does, however, haveits drawbacks. The stops are farther from the market—when they gethit, you lose more. Also, you have to sit through long periods of inac-tivity, which many people find hard to tolerate, and you miss manyshort-term trading opportunities.\nSwing traders have more opportunities than trend traders, gaining\nmore experience from frequent trades. The dollar risk is lower thanksto closer stops, and quick rewards provide emotional satisfaction.Swing trading also has its drawbacks. Expenses for commissions andslippage are higher, due to more frequent trading. You must workevery day, actively managing trades. Also, you are likely to miss majormoves—you can’t catch big fish on a small hook.\nTrend trading—buying and holding in a major bull market—works\nbest with the type of stocks that Peter Lynch calls 10-baggers, thosethat go up by a factor of 10. They are usually newer, cheaper, less sea-soned issues. An Internet or a biotech company with a hot new inven-tion, a new patent, or a new idea is more likely to go up by a hugepercentage than the stock of an old established firm. A small companymay bet its future on a single idea or product, and its stock will soarif the public buys that bet or stay in the doghouse if it doesn’t. Hada large multinational company come up with the same invention, itsstock would have barely budged because one more product makeslittle difference for a huge firm.\nThe lure of big trends makes stocks of small companies in promis-\ning new industries attractive to trend traders. Swing traders shouldselect their candidates from among the most actively traded stocks onmajor exchanges. Look for large-cap stocks which swing within broad,well-defined channels.188 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nOnce you choose a stock, don’t assume it will continue to behave\nthe same way forever. Companies change, and you must stay on topof your picks. For example, DELL, started by Michael Dell in his col-lege dorm room, used to be a tiny public company, but grew into oneof the largest computer firms in the world. A friend of mine bought$50,000 worth of Dell in the early 1990s and cashed out three yearslater at $2.3 million, but DELL’s days of spiking through the roof anddoubling twice a year are gone. Instead, this widely held stock hasbecome a vehicle for swing traders, and not a very active one at that.\nA beginning trader is better off learning to catch swings, because\nprofit targets and stops are clearer, feedback comes faster, and moneymanagement is easier. The choice between trend trading and swingtrading is partly objective and partly subjective. Should you trade trendsor swings? My impression, after meeting thousands of traders andinvestors, is that the elite tend to trade the big moves and ride majortrends, but people who can do it successfully are few and far between.There are many more traders who make money—sometimes very seri-ous money—by trading swings. The principles of Triple Screen workfor both, even though the entries and especially the exits are different.\nTREND TRADING Trend trading means holding your positions for a long\ntime, sometimes for months. It requires holding while your stocks reactagainst the main trend. Bull and bear markets are driven by shifts inthe fundamentals, such as new technologies and discoveries in the caseof stocks, weather patterns in the case of agricultural markets, politicalshifts in the case of currencies, and so on. Fundamental factors arebehind bull and bear markets, but prices move only in response toactions by traders and investors. When your fundamental informationforecasts a major move, you need to analyze the charts to see whetherthe technicals confirm the fundamentals.\nA market doesn’t send you an invitation before it takes off. When a\ntrend first climbs out of the cellar, few people pay attention. Amateursare fast asleep, while professionals monitor their markets and scan forbreakouts and divergences. Active markets get into the news becausethe lows and especially the highs attract journalists. One of the key dif-ferences between the pros and the outsiders is that the pros alwaystrack their markets, while amateurs wake up and look at charts onlyafter a market hits the news. By that time the train has already left thestation. The ABC Rating System, described on page 255, can help youhandle the challenge of tracking stocks through inactive periods.TRADING 189\nA new breakout is easy to recognize but hard to trade and even\nharder to hold. As a trend speeds up, more and more people pray fora pullback. The stronger the trend, the less likely it is to accommodatebargain hunters. It takes a lot of patience and confidence to hold aposition in a trend. Traders tend to be active men with the attitude of“don’t just sit there, do something.” Learning to be passive comes hardto them. One reason women tend to trade better is that they are morelikely to be patient.\nHow can you teach yourself to trade trends? You may begin by\nstudying historical charts, but remember, there is no substitute forexperience. The idea is to learn by doing. Start by putting on positionsso small that you can be relaxed and not tie your mind into a knot.Trade only a few hundred shares or a single futures contract whileyou’re learning.\nTo apply Triple Screen to trend trading, monitor long-term charts for\nbreakouts or look for well-established moves, identified by a weekly EMA.When the weeklies tell you to be bullish or bearish, return to the dailiesand use oscillators to find entry points. Put on long positions in up-trends when prices touch their rising daily EMA and keep adding onpullbacks. You can also add when daily oscillators, such as MACD-Histogram or Force Index, give buy signals, especially when they coincidewith pullbacks. Reverse the procedure in downtrends. When theweekly trend is down and daily oscillators rally and reach overboughtlevels, they signal to sell short, especially when they coincide with ral-lies to the EMA.\nThe idea is to position yourself in the direction of the market tide\nand use the waves that go against that tide to build up your initial posi-tion. As a beginner, learn to trade a single small position, but once youstart making money, the size of your positions and the number of addi-tions become a function of money management.\nOnce you recognize a new trend, get in! New trends, springing\nout of trading ranges, are notoriously fast, with few or no pullbacks.If you think you have identified a new trend, hop aboard. You canreduce your risk by trading a smaller size, but do not wait for adeep pullback. Those may come later, and you will be able to add toyour position. Jumping aboard a new trend feels counterintuitive, butbeing in the market makes you more alert to its behavior. The greatGeorge Soros was only half-joking when he said, “Buy first, investi-gate later.”190 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nPlace your initial stop at the breakout level, where the new trend\nerupted from the range. A rocket that takes off from its launching padhas no business sinking back to the ground. Do not hurry to moveyour initial stop. Wait for a reaction and then a new move before mov-ing your stop to the bottom of that reaction. The SafeZone stops, whichwork so well for swings, are much too tight for big trends. While rid-ing a tide, you must expect the waves to swing against you and stillhold your position.\nTrend trading means retaining your initial position through thick and\nthin. You are fishing for very big fish, and you need plenty of room. Oneof the reasons so few people make big money from big trends is thatthey become anxious and hyperactive and forget to hang on. Trendsare unlike swings, where you must take profits and run fast. Stay withthe trend unless weekly trend-following indicators go flat or reverse.\nAmateurs often outsmart themselves by trying to pick the end of a\ntrend—a notoriously hard task. As Peter Lynch aptly put it, trying tocatch a bottom is like trying to catch a falling knife—you invariablygrab it in the wrong spot. Trends tend to overshoot rational expecta-tions. News, daily chart patterns, and other distractions try to throwyou off the saddle. Hang on! Consider trading a core position and sup-plementary positions. You may put on a core position with a wide stopand no definite profit target, while swinging in and out of additionalpositions—buying on declines to the EMA or selling on rallies to theupper channel line. Consider using two different accounts for easierrecord keeping.\nSWING TRADING Markets spend most of their time going nowhere.\nThey rally a few days, pause, decline a few days, and rally again. Smallswings—weekly, daily, or hourly—are more common than big trends.By the end of the month the market may be higher or lower, but it hastraveled up and down several times. Newcomers get shaken out, whileprofessionals enjoy the short rides.\nMarkets’ tendency to swing above and below value has been statis-\ntically confirmed by several researchers. Swing trading means buyingnormalcy and selling mania (buy near the rising moving average, sellnear the upper channel line) or shorting normalcy and coveringdepression (sell short near the falling moving average and cover at thelower channel line). The best swing-trading candidates are amongthe m ost active stocks and blue chips that tend to rock, more or lessTRADING 191\nregularly, within their channels. Cats and dogs are best left for trend\ntrading. To draw a list of candidates, start with the 20 most activestocks and a handful of famous blue chips, and choose the ones withthe widest channels and the most regular swings.\nBe sure to select only those candidates whose daily channels are\nwide enough for a C-level trader to take at least a point out of a trade.A C trader is someone who normally takes 10% or more out of a chan-nel. The only way you can prove you are a B or even an A trader isby trading at that level for at least six months. Even A traders are bet-ter off with broad channels because profits are fatter. Beginners haveno choice but to use the “1 point for a C trader” rule. This translatesinto 10-point channels. Technical signals may look delicious, but if achannel is narrower than 10 points, click on to the next stock.\nSome stocks give better technical signals than others. Look for a\nhandful of regular performers; you need six or seven, certainly no morethan 10. Tracking just a handful of issues allows you to keep up yourdaily homework without running ragged or falling behind. Learn thepersonalities of your stocks, rate yourself on every trade, and once youbecome a steady B trader, increase your trading size.\nWhen the weekly trend is up, wait for daily oscillators to become\noversold while prices decline toward the EMA. When the weekly trendis down, look for sell signals from daily oscillators while prices rallytoward the EMA. If an oscillator falls to a new multi-month low whileprices are moving toward the EMA, it shows that bears are extra strongand it is better to put off buying until the following bottom. The reverseapplies to shorting.\nIn a weekly uptrend, the bottoms of daily charts tend to be very\nsharp affairs. The best time to buy is when the market stabs below itsdaily EMA. The best time to short is when the market stabs above it.To place an order near the EMA, estimate its level for tomorrow. Themath is simple. You know where the EMA was yesterday and where itclosed today. If it has risen, say, by half a point, expect tomorrow’s risealso to be half a point and add that to today’s EMA.\nTake a look at how your stock has behaved since the latest trend\nbegan. If the trend is up, look at the previous declines. If the stock hasreturned to the EMA three times and penetrated it by an average of apoint and a half, place a buy order approximately a point below themoving average, a little more shallow than the previous declines. Esti-mate the EMA for tomorrow and adjust your buy orders daily. Electronicbrokers do not become irritated when you change orders each day!192 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nSwing trading, like fishing, demands a great deal of attention and\npatience. You need to do your homework daily, calculate the estimatedEMA for tomorrow, and place orders. You also must calculate yourprofit targets and stops.\nAfter entering a swing trade, place a protective stop, using the\nSafeZone method. Swing trading is a high-wire act, requiring a safetynet. Stops and money management are essential for your survival andsuccess.\nTake profits near the channel line. The exact level depends on the\nstrength of the swing. If MACD-Histogram and Force Index are makingnew highs, the market is strong, and you can wait for the channel lineto be hit. If they act weak, grab your first profit while it’s still there.What if a strong swing overshoots the channel line? An experiencedtrader may shift his tactics and hold a little longer, perhaps until theday when the market fails to reach a new extreme. A beginner musttrain himself to take profits near the channel wall because he does nothave the skills to switch on the fly. Being able to take a limited profitwithout kicking yourself for missing a big part of a move is a sign ofemotional maturity. It is liberating to accept what you asked for andnot worry about the rest. Profit targets help you create a structure inan unstructured environment. Measure your performance as the per-centage of the channel width. You must grade yourself to know whereyou stand.\nEarly in your trading career, it is safer to concentrate on swings. As\nyour level of expertise rises, allocate a portion of your capital to trad-ing trends. Major trends offer spectacular profit opportunities—the bigmoney is in big moves. You owe it to yourself to learn to trade them.Concentrate on quality, and money will follow.\nOptions\nThe number of shares in any company is fixed, but options are createdout of thin air by writers responding to buyers’ demand. An optionbuyer hopes that the price will get to his target fast enough, and thewriter sells him that hope. Most hopes never get fulfilled, but peoplekeep hoping and buying options. Fund managers, floor traders, andexchange members sell hope by the truckload to amateurs who buycalls in bull markets and puts in bear markets.\nA call gives its holder a right, but not an obligation, to buy a certain\nquantity of a specified security at a specified price at a specified time.TRADING 193\nIt is a bet on a price increase. A put is a right, but not an obligation,\nto sell a certain quantity of a specified security at a specified price at aspecified time. It is a bet on a price drop.\nEach option has an exercise price (also called strike price ). If a\nstock fails to reach that price before the exercise date, the optionexpires worthless and the buyer loses what he paid; meanwhile, thewriter keeps his loot, the polite name of which is option premium . To\nprofit from buying or shorting stocks, you must pick the right stockand the right direction. An option buyer’s job is much harder be-cause in addition to that he must bet on how fast the stock will getto his level.\nAn option is at-the-money when the current price of the underlying secu-\nrity equals the exercise price.\nA call is out-of-the-money when the current price of the underlying secu-\nrity is below the exercise price. A put is out-of-the-money when the cur-rent price of the underlying is above the exercise price. The fartherout-of-the-money, the cheaper the option.\nA call is in-the-money when the current price of the underlying security is\nabove the exercise price. A put is in-the-money when the current priceof the underlying is below the exercise price.\nAn option can be at-the-money, out-of-the-money, or in-the-money at\ndifferent times in its life, as the price of the underlying security changes.The price of every option has two components: intrinsic value andtime value.\nAn option’s intrinsic value is above zero only when it’s in-the-money.\nIf the exercise price of a call is $80, and the underlying security risesto $83, the intrinsic value is $3. If the security is at or below $80, theintrinsic value of that call is zero.\nThe other component of each option’s price is time value. If the stock\ntrades at $74 and people pay $2 for an $80 call, the entire $2 representstime value. If the stock rises to $83, and the price of the call jumps to$4, $3 of that is intrinsic value ($83 − $80), while $1 is time value (the\nhope that this stock will rise even higher during the life of that option).\nOption price depends on several factors:\nThe farther out-of-the-money, the cheaper the option—the underlying\nsecurity must travel a longer distance to make it worth anything beforeit expires.194 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nThe closer the expiration day, the cheaper the option—it has less time to\nfulfill the hope. The speed with which an option loses value is calledtime decay , which becomes steeper as the expiration nears.\nThe less volatile the underlying security, the cheaper the option, because\nthe chance of that security making a large move is lower.\nOther factors influencing the price of an option include the current level\nof interest rates and the dividend rate of the underlying stock.\nWhen a stock trades at 100, a 110 call is worth more that a 120 call\nbecause that stock is more likely to rise to 110 than to 120. A stock ismore likely to rise to 110 in five months than in two, making a longercall more valuable. Finally, if two stocks are selling for 100, but onehas moved 50 so far this year while the other has moved only 30, thena 110 call for the more volatile stock is likely to be priced higher.\nDifferent factors of option pricing may clash and partially cancel\neach other out. For example, if a market drops sharply, reducing thevalue of calls, the increase in volatility will lift option values, and thecalls may lose less value than expected. There are several mathemati-cal models, such as Black-Scholes, widely described in options litera-ture, to determine what is called a fair value of an option.\nThe simplest option strategy is to buy them. That’s what beginners\ndo, especially buying calls when they cannot afford to buy stocks.They miss the fact that options are more complex than stocks andsomeone who can’t make money in stocks is doomed in options. A moresophisticated strategy involves writing, or selling, options. A writer maybe either covered or naked.\nCovered writers own the underlying securities. For example, a fund\nmay hold IBM stock and sell calls against them, figuring that if thestock does not reach its exercise price and the options expire worth-less, they’ll pocket the extra income. If IBM rises to the exercise priceand their option is called, they’ll sell their stock at a profit, use themoney to buy another, and sell calls against it. Covered writing wasvery profitable in the early years of exchange-traded options. By nowthe field is very crowded, and the returns have shrunk. Naked writing,to be reviewed later involves selling options without owning theunderlying securities, with writers backing up what they sell only withcash in their accounts.\nThe above was a brief summary of option terms. To learn more, please\nturn to the literature on options, listed at the end of this chapter. JustTRADING 195\nwatch out for the books that promise a “simple strategy for tripling\nyour money in a year, working 15 minutes a day, with no math.”People who make money in options tend to be mathematically savvyand highly capitalized, the exact opposite of an average wide-eyedgambler who hopes to make a quick buck from his $5,000 stake. Letus now review options strategies for buying and writing.\nBuying Options—The Major Reversal Tactic It is harder to make\nmoney buying options than stocks. You face all the usual problems, suchas choosing the right stock, identifying its trend, and selecting entry andexit points. In addition, you must worry how fast your stock will getwhere you expect it to go. If you buy a rising stock and it takes fivemonths instead of three to reach its target, you still have a winning trade.Do the same with options, and they’ll expire worthless. If you decide tobuy more time by getting longer-term options, you’ll lose money in a dif-ferent way, because those options are more expensive and move moreslowly. All options keep losing time value. Poor beginners who buythem as a substitute for stocks rush in where the pros fear to tread!\nProfessionals tend to buy options only on special occasions, when\nthey expect a major reversal, especially to the downside. If you expectnot a little downtrend in a stock but a massive crash, buying a put maybe a good idea. When a long-term trend begins to turn, especially nearthe top, it creates massive turbulence, like an ocean liner changing itscourse. A stock may collapse today and soar tomorrow, only to collapseagain. When volatility goes through the roof, even well-heeled tradershave trouble placing stops. A stop belongs outside the zone of marketnoise, but where do you put it when the noise level rises to a roar?Options allow you to sidestep this problem, at a price which can onlybe covered by a major move.\nPrices tend to fall twice as fast as they rise. Greed, the dominant emo-\ntion of uptrends, is a happy and lasting feeling. Fear, the dominant emo-tion of downtrends, is sharper and more violent. Professionals are morelikely to buy puts because of shorter exposure to time decay. When youexpect a major downside reversal, buying a put can be a sensible trade.The same principles apply to calls, but uptrends are better traded withstocks.\nA trader who expects a downswing must decide which put to buy. The\nbest choice is counterintuitive and different from what most people get.\nEstimate how low you expect a stock to collapse. A put is worth buy-\ning only if you expect a waterfall decline. 196 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAvoid puts with more than two months of life. Buying puts makes\nsense only when you expect a sharp decline. If you anticipate a drawn-out downtrend, it is better to sell short the underlying security.\nLook for cheap puts whose price reflects no hope. Move your finger\ndown the column of put strikes. The lower you go, the cheaper theputs. At first, each time you drop to the next strike price, a put is 25%or even 35% cheaper than the previous level. Eventually you come tothe strike level at which you would only save a tiny fraction of price.This shows that all hope has been squeezed out of that put, and it ispriced like a cheap lottery ticket. That is the one you want!\nBuying a very cheap, far-out-of-the-money put is counterintuitive. It\nis so far-out-of-the-money and has so little life left in it that it seemslikely to expire worthless. You can’t place a stop on it, so if you’rewrong, the entire premium will go up in smoke. Why not buy a putcloser to the money?\nThe only time to buy a put is when you’re shooting for an excep-\ntional gain from a major reversal. In an ordinary downtrend it’s betterto short stocks. Cheap far-out-of-the-money puts provide the most bangfor the buck. Aim for a 10-fold gain or better, rather than the usual 2:1or 3:1 ratio. Returns like these allow you to be wrong on a string oftrades, yet come out ahead in the end. Catching one major reversal willmake up for a string of losses and leave you very profitable.\nThe best options trade I ever made was during the October 1989\nminicrash in the stock market. On Thursday the market closed weak,with new lows exceeding the new highs for the first time in over ayear, which gave me a long-awaited sell signal. On Friday morning,while at a trade show in Chicago, I bought OEX puts at \n3⁄8. On Friday\nafternoon the bottom fell out of the market. On Monday the marketopened sharply lower and my puts, purchased just a few trading hoursago at less than half a point, were bid at 17.\nWhy don’t more people use this tactic? First, it requires a great deal\nof patience, as opportunities are very infrequent. It offers very littleentertainment value. Most people cannot stomach the idea of beingwrong three, four, or five times in a row, even if they are likely to makemoney in the end. This is why so few traders play one of the greatestgames in the options market.\nWriting Options Beginners, gamblers, and undercapitalized traders\nmake up the majority of option buyers. Just think of all the money lostby those hapless folks in their eagerness to get rich quick. Have youTRADING 197\nsent a few dollars down the options hole? Who got all that money?\nBrokers, of course, but mostly options writers. Well-capitalized profes-sionals tend to write options rather than buy them. Covered writers selloptions against securities they own. Naked writers sell options withoutowning the underlying securities.\nA stock or a future can do one of three things: rise, fall, or stay flat.\nWhen you buy a call, you can profit only if the market rises, but loseif it goes down or stays flat, and sometimes even if it rises but notfastenough. When you buy a put, you win only if the market falls fast\nenough. An options buyer makes money only if the market goes hisway, but loses if it goes against him or stays flat. A buyer has one chanceto win out of three, but the odds are two out of three for an optionwriter. No wonder the pros prefer writing options.\nLarge funds tend to use computerized models to buy stocks and\nwrite covered calls against them. If a stock stays below the strike price,they pocket the premium and write a new call with a new expirationdate. If a stock rises high enough to be called, they deliver it, collectthe money, invest in another stock, and write calls against it. Coveredwriting is a mathematically demanding, capital-intensive business. Mostserious players spread their costs, including staff and equipment,across a large capital base. A small trader doesn’t have much of anedge in this expensive enterprise.\nNaked writers sell options without owning the underlying securities,\nsimilar to shorting. A naked writer collects his premium at the outsetof the trade but his risk is unlimited if the position goes against himand he fails to get out. If you own a stock, sell a call, and that stockgets called, you have something to deliver. If you sell a naked calland the stock rises to its exercise price, the option buyer can demanddelivery, whether you own that stock or not. Imagine selling calls ona stock that becomes a takeover play and opens $50 higher the nextmorning—you still have to deliver. It can hurt.\nLimited reward with unlimited risk scares most traders away from\nnaked writing, but the reality and perception are usually quite differ-ent in the markets. Writing naked options seems very dangerous, butmost of the time a far-out-of-the-money option with a short time to theexpiration is very likely to expire worthless, to the benefit of the writer.Its chance of reaching the exercise price and causing a loss to a writeris very low. The risk/reward ratio in naked writing is a lot better thanit looks, and there are techniques for reducing the impact of a rareadverse move.198 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nSavvy naked writers tend to sell out-of-the-money calls and puts at\nlevels that a stock or a commodity is unlikely to reach during theoption’s life. They sell distant hopes. Good writers track market volatil-ity to find how far a stock is likely to move, based on its recent con-duct, and sell options outside that range. If a stock took a year to risefrom 60 to 130, the pros are going to fall all over themselves trying toserve some greenhorn who wants to buy 170 calls that will expire in afew weeks. The chance of that stock rising 40 points before the optionexpiration is exceedingly low. A gullible amateur wants to buy hope,and the pros are delighted to sell it to him. This game goes into highgear during the week or two prior to option expiration, when the floormints money out of thin air, selling naked puts and calls that havealmost no chance of reaching their exercise price.\nCautious writers may close their positions without waiting for the\nexpiration date. If you write a call at 90 cents and it goes down to 10,it may make sense to buy it back and unwind your position. You’vealready earned the bulk of profit, so why expose yourself to continuedrisk? It is cheaper to pay another commission, book your profits, andlook for another writing opportunity.\nBecoming a naked writer requires absolute iron discipline. The size\nof your writes and the number of positions must be strictly determinedby money management rules. If you sell a naked call and the stock ral-lies above its exercise price, it exposes you to the risk of ruin. Youmust decide in advance at what level you will cut and run, taking a rel-atively small loss. A naked seller cannot afford to sit when a stockmoves against him. Amateurs hang on and wait for the underlyingsecurity to turn around. They wait for the wasting time value to getthem off the hook. The longer you wait for a miracle, the deeper thesteel hook of the market lodges in your intestines. Stay away fromnaked writing if you have the slightest problem with discipline!\nWRITER ’SCHOICE All options buyers know this sad sequence: you’re\nright on the direction of the market, right on the stock, but still losemoney on the option. Time is the enemy of options buyers. Buyerslose when the underlying security takes longer than expected to get tothe level at which they can collect on their bet. As the expiration datenears, an option becomes worth less, and less, and less.\nWhat if we reverse this process and write rather than buy options?\nNow time will work in our favor because each passing day will reducethe likelihood of that option having any value before it expires.TRADING 199\nThe first time you write an option, and do it right, you’ll experience\nthe delicious sensation of time working in your favor. The option losessome of its time value each day, making the premium you’ve collectedsafer and safer. When the market goes nowhere, you still make money,as time value evaporates with each passing day.\nIf living well is the best revenge, then taking a factor that kills most\noptions buyers—time—and making it work for you is a gratifyingexperience.\nWe must not forget that an option is a hope, and it is better to sell\nempty hopes which are unlikely to be fulfilled. Take three steps beforewriting a call or a put. First, analyze the underlying security, decidewhich way it’s moving, and estimate its price target. Second, decidewhether to write a put or a call. Third, choose the strike price and theexpiration date for the option you’ll write. If any one of these stepsseems unclear, stand aside, do not force a decision, and look foranother opportunity.\nOne of the key factors in pricing options is the volatility of the\nunderlying security. A tool included in most trading software, calledBollinger bands, can help you rate volatility. Those standard deviationbands are centered around a moving average but unlike envelopes,whose walls are parallel, they expand and contract as volatility changes.Bollinger bands become narrow when markets are sleepy and widewhen they grow wild. Flat, narrow bands indicate a sleepy marketwhere options are cheap and it is better to buy them rather than sell.When Bollinger bands go to a wide spread, they mark an overheatedmarket where options tend to be overpriced, creating an opportunityfor writers. Here are the steps to follow:\nAnalyze a security against which you want to write options. Use\nTriple Screen to decide whether a stock, future, or an index is trend-ing or nontrending. Use weekly and daily charts, trend-followingindicators, and oscillators to identify trends, detect reversals, and set upprice targets.\nSelect the type of option to write. If your analysis is bearish, consider\nwriting calls. If bullish, consider writing puts. When the trend is up, sellthe hope that it will turn down, and when it’s down, sell the hope it’llturn up. Do not write options when markets are flat and Bollingerbands are tight because premiums are low, and a breakout from a trad-ing range can hurt you.\nEstimate how far, with a generous safety margin, the market would\nhave to move in order to change its trend, and write an option beyond200 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nthat zone. Write an option with a strike price the market is unlikely to\nreach before the expiration. Suppose a stock is at 80, having risen from50 in the past year and is now rising half a point per week, with 8weeks left to option expiration. The trend is up, and selling a 70 putunder those circumstances means selling an option that is likely toexpire worthless.\nThe temptation to sell naked options close to the money and get\nfatter premiums is dangerous, because a slight countertrend move canpush your position underwater. Look at the number of weeks remain-ing to the expiration, calculate the distance the market is likely to travelbased on its recent behavior, and write an option outside that range.\nWrite options with no more than two months to the expiration. The\nshorter the time, the fewer surprises. The erosion of time value accel-erates in the last few weeks of option life. When you write optionsclose to the expiration, you benefit from faster time decay. You can getmore money for options with longer life, but do not get greedy. Thegoal of a writer is not to make a killing on any single trade but to grindout a steady income.\nLIMITING RISKA trader can keep writing naked calls or puts, but do it\nlong enough, and some day he will get caught on the wrong side of apowerful move. Profits of several years can be wiped out in a single day.\nFor example, whenever there is a great bull market, the pros look\nat selling puts like a license to print money. The contrarians, thealarmists, and “the end is nigh” crowd keep buying puts for years andlosing money, but suddenly there is a crash and buyers have their dayin the sun. The pros who have been feeding off them for years facetheir day of reckoning—the quick ones survive, while the slow onesare carried out feet first.\nA trader can grow fat and greedy writing naked options, selling\nuseless contracts created out of thin air and pocketing profits. Asmug feeling of self-satisfaction blinds people to reality. Naked posi-tions in options need to be protected by stops and money manage-ment rules.\nUse a mental stop-loss on the underlying security. Set a stop on the\nunderlying stock, future, or index and not on the price of your option.Buy back that option if the underlying security reaches your stop level.For example, if you sell a naked 80 call on a stock trading at 70, placeyour stop at 77. Get out of your naked option position before it getsinto the money by crossing its exercise price.TRADING 201\nYour stop is like an ejection seat on an aircraft. If you write an out-\nof-the-money option and the market starts moving into the money,there is no point in sticking around, waiting to see what happens next.You are wrong, and you’re losing—push the eject button before thedamage turns deadly. If you sold an option for 1.50, by the time it hitsyour at-the-money stop level it may double in price to 3. If you usestops, you’ll be nowhere near the “unlimited loss” that makes peopleafraid to write options.\nSet your profit-taking zone—consider buying back your naked\noption. When you write a call or a put, you sell a wasting asset. When\nthe underlying security moves far from the exercise price but there isstill time left to the expiration, the price of that option may reach itsrock bottom. It loses value only in tiny dribs and drabs. The loser whobought that option still has a bit of a chance that the market mayreverse in his favor. He continues to hold that call or put like a lotteryticket, and once in a rare while his ticket may win.\nWhy hold an open position in an option that has already given you\nmost of its value? You have little to gain, while remaining exposed tothe risk of an adverse move. Consider buying back that option to closeout your profitable trade.\nOpen an insurance account. A naked seller needs insurance against\na catastrophic reversal. You may write a put and the market crashesthe next day, or you write a call and suddenly there is a takeover. Youhope this never happens, but trade long enough and eventually every-thing will happen! That’s why you need insurance. Nobody will writeit for you, so you’ll have to self-insure.\nOpen a money market account, and every time you close out a\nnaked writing position, throw a percentage of your profit, 10 percentor more, into that account. Do not use it for trading. Have it sit there,in a money market fund, for as long as you write options. Your insur-ance account grows with each new profit, ready to cover a catastrophicloss or to be taken out in cash when you stop writing options!\nOption writers get hurt in one of three ways. Beginners overtrade and\nwrite too many options, breaking money management rules. Intermediate-level traders get hurt when they fail to run fast enough when theiroptions move against them. Experienced traders can get blown out ifthey do not have a reserve against a major adverse move. The longeryou trade, the greater your risk of a catastrophic event. Having an insur-ance account confirms your position as a professional option writer.202 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?Every options trader should own Lawrence\nMcMillan’s Options as a Strategic Investment and use it as a handbook.\nMost professional traders read Sheldon Natenberg’s Option Volatility\nand Pricing Strategies. Harvey Friedentag’s Options: Investing without\nFearhas a nice angle on covered writing.\nFutures\nFutures used to have such a bad reputation that several states tried to\noutlaw them a century ago. They used to have Sunday sermons againstfutures in parts of the agricultural belt. None of that prevented futuresfrom evolving into a potent economic force.\nFutures markets have prospered because they serve two groups that\nhave a great deal of money. On the one hand, futures permit majorcommercial producers and consumers to hedge price risks, giving thema fantastic competitive advantage. On the other hand, futures offer spec-ulators a gambling palace with more choices than all the casinos inNevada. Between the hedgers and the speculators, on a ground richlysoaked with blood and money, are professional futures traders. Theyhelp move the wheels of commerce and take a fee for their services. A signof their profitability is the fact that many of those public servants passtheir craft to their sons and now occasionally even to their daughters.\nHedging means opening a futures position that is the opposite of\none’s position in the actual commodity. It removes the price risk fromholding a cash commodity or planning to buy such a commodity in thefuture. Hedgers transfer price risks to commodity speculators. Thisallows them to concentrate on their core businesses, offer better con-sumer pricing, and obtain a long-term competitive advantage over theirunhedged competitors.\nFor example, I have two friends, brokers in Moscow, who teach\nsugar importers how to hedge (Russia has become the world’s biggestimporter of sugar since the breakup of the Soviet Union). Their clientsare big players in the food industry, who know up to a year in advancehow much sugar they’re going to need. Now they can buy sugar futuresin London or New York when prices are low enough. They are goingto need their trainloads of sugar many months from now, but mean-while they hold sugar futures, which they plan to sell when they buytheir cash position. In effect, they are short cash, long futures. If sugarprices go up and they have to pay more than expected, they will offsetTRADING 203\nthat loss by making roughly the same profit on their futures positions.\nTheir unhedged competitors are in effect flipping a coin. If sugar pricesfall, they’ll buy on the cheap and reap a windfall, but if they rise, they’llbe hung out to dry. The importers who are hedged can concentrate onrunning their core business instead of watching the price ticker.\nProducers of commodities also benefit from hedging. An agribusi-\nness can presell its wheat, coffee, or cotton when prices are highenough to guarantee profits. They sell short as many futures contractsas it takes to cover their prospective crop. From that point on, theyhave no price risk. If prices go down, they’ll make up their losses oncash commodities by profits on futures. If prices go up, they’ll losemoney on their short positions in futures but make it back sellingthe actual commodities. Producers give up a chance of a windfall butinsulate themselves from the risk of lower prices. Survivors thrive onstability. That why the Exxons, the Coca-Colas, and the Nabiscos areamong the major players in the commodity markets. Hedgers are theultimate insiders, and a good hedging department not only buys priceinsurance, but serves as a profit center.\nSpeculators step in to assume market risks, lured by the glitter of\nprofits. Hedgers, with their inside information, are not fully confidentabout future prices, while crowds of cheerful outsiders plunk downmoney to bet on price direction. It reminds me how, years ago, Iwalked into a liquor store with a scientist friend to buy some wine fordinner. This was soon after the state of New Jersey introduced a lot-tery to pay for education. There was a huge line at the counter, as lot-tery tickets in those days were sold only in liquor stores. When myfriend, who owned a house in New Jersey, saw what was happening,he doubled up laughing, “You mean these people are lining up tokeep my taxes down?!” That’s pretty much what most speculators doin futures.\nThe two largest groups of speculators are farmers and engineers.\nFarmers produce commodities, while engineers love to apply scientificmethods to the market game. Many small farmers enter futures marketsas hedgers but catch the bug and start speculating. There’s nothingwrong with that, as long as they know what they are doing. It neverceases to amaze me how many farmers end up trading stock indexfutures. As long as they trade corn, cattle, or soybeans, their feel forthe fundamentals gives them an edge over city slickers. But what’s theiredge in the S&P 500? Faster reflexes than the rest of us? Gimme a break!204 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nThere is one profound difference between futures and stocks, mak-\ning the futures game extremely fast, furious, exciting, and deadly. Thefutures markets are turbocharged by a simple but potent device of lowmargin requirements.\nUnited States securities law demands that in the stock market you pay\nat least half the cash value of your position. Your broker can give youa margin loan for the other half. If you have $30,000 in your account,you may buy $60,000 worth of stocks, and no more. The law waspassed after the Crash of 1929 when people realized that low marginsled to excessive speculation, which contributed to the viciousness ofdeclines. Prior to 1929, speculators could buy stocks on a 10% margin,which worked great in bull markets but wiped them out in bear markets.\nMargins of only three to five percent are common in the futures mar-\nkets. Here you can bet big with little money. If you have $30,000, youcan control $1,000,000 worth of merchandise, be it pork bellies or gold.If you catch a 1% move in your market, you’ll make $10,000, or over30% profit on your account. A few trades like that, and you’ve madeit. A small trader looks at these numbers and thinks he’s found thesecret to getting rich quick. There is only one problem. Before thatmarket rises 1% it may dip 2%. It may be a meaningless blip, but at thebottom the amate ur’s equity will be nearly wiped out, and his broker will\nsell him out on a mar gin call. He’ll go bust even though his price fore-\ncast was correct.\nThe mortality rate among futures traders is over 90 percent, even\nthough brokerage houses try to hide statistics. Easy margins attractgamblers and adrenaline addicts who quickly go up in smoke. Thereis nothing wrong with trading futures that money management won’tcure. Futures are very tradable, as long as you observe money man-agement rules and do not go crazy with an easy margin. You have tobe more than disciplined—to trade commodities you must be colderthan a freezer. If you cannot follow money management rules, better goto Las Vegas. The entertainment value is just as high and the outcomeis the same, but the drinks are free and the floor show more glitzy.\nPrecisely because they require a high degree of discipline and excel-\nlent money management skills, futures markets are hard for beginners.A new trader is better off learning to trade slower-moving stocks, butlater on, futures definitely deserve a look.\nIf you know how to trade and want to make a quick fortune, futures\nare the place to be. You may put on small initial positions, fenced inTRADING 205\nby strict money management rules, but then you can pyramid them to\nthe hilt as a trade moves in your favor and you keep moving stopsbeyond breakeven and adding new contracts.\nThere are only a few dozen futures, making the choice of which to\ntrade much easier than among the thousands of stocks. Be sure tofocus on markets in your own time zone. It is shocking how manybeginners, especially outside the United States, want to trade curren-cies. Few of them stop to think that this is a 24-hour market, operatingaround the clock, in which an individual trader has many disadvan-tages. You may brilliantly analyze a currency and forecast a move, butthat move is just as likely to take place in another time zone while youare sleeping. Try to select markets that trade in your time zone that areopen when you are awake and closed when you’re asleep.\nIt is a good idea to make your first steps in those markets where you\nknow something about the fundamentals. If you are a cattle rancher, ahouse builder, or a loan officer, then cattle, lumber, or interest ratefutures are logical starting points, if you can afford to trade them. If youhave no particular interests, your choice is limited only by youraccount size. It is important to make your first steps in relatively inex-pensive markets. All markets have a certain amount of random noise,or quick countertrend moves. The high dollar value of random movesin expensive markets can be deadly.\nTake yourself through a simple exercise. Create a spreadsheet on\nyour computer and write down the names of several futures marketsthat interest you in column A. Write the value of their price units in col-umn B. Corn trades in cents, and the value of a cent is $50; S&P tradesin points, and the value of a point is $250, so those values go into col-umn B. Write the latest closing price in column C. Now complete theexercise by creating column D which multiplies B by C and shows howmuch each contract is worth. How much more expensive is the richestcontract compared to the cheapest contract? Five times? Ten? Twenty?Thirty? Do the exercise and find out.\nBeginners are drawn to the S&P 500 futures, but few have accounts\nlarge enough for proper money management in this expensive mar-ket. In North America, corn, sugar, and, in a slow year, copper aregood markets for beginners, allowing you to learn in your own timezone. They are liquid, reasonably volatile, and not too expensive.\nSome very good books, listed on page 213, have been written about\nfutures. Most technical analysis tools were originally developed for206 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nfutures and only later migrated to the stock market. Let us review a few\naspects of futures that make them different from stocks.\nCONTANGO AND INVERSION All futures markets offer contracts for several\ndelivery months at the same time. For example, you can buy or sellwheat for delivery in September or December of this year, March ofnext year, and so on. Normally, the nearby months are less expensivethan the faraway months, and that relationship is called a contango\nmarket .\nHigher prices for longer-term contracts reflect the so-called cost of\ncarry, that is, the cost of financing, storing, and insuring a commodity.\nA futures buyer plunks down his 3% margin and controls a contractwithout having to bring the rest of the money until the settlement date.Meanwhile the seller has to store, finance, and insure the merchandise.\nThe differences between delivery months are called premiums.\nHedgers and floor traders closely watch premiums because they reflectthe degree of tightness in the market. When the supply shrinks or thedemand rises, people start paying up for the nearby months. The pre-mium for the faraway months begins to shrink. As the demand grows,the front months become pricier than faraway months—the marketbecomes inverted! This is one of the strongest fundamental signs of abull market. There is a real shortage out there, and people are payingextra to get their stuff sooner rather than later.\nWhenever you look at the commodity page of a financial newspa-\nper, move your finger down the column of closing prices and look forinversions. They signal bull markets, and that’s when you want to usetechnical analysis to look for buying opportunities. \nSerious hedgers do not wait for inversions. They monitor premiums\nand get their signals from their narrowing or widening. A good specu-lator can rattle off the latest prices, but a good hedger will quote youthe latest premiums of faraway contracts over the nearby ones.\nAs you scan futures markets for inversions, keep in mind that there\nis one area in which inversion is the norm. Interest rate futures arealways inverted because those who hold cash positions keep collect-ing interest instead of paying finance and storage charges.\nSPREADS Hedgers tend to dominate the short side of the markets and\nmost speculators are perpetual bulls, but floor traders love to tradespreads. Spreading means buying one delivery month and sellingTRADING 207\nanother in the same market, or going long one market and short a\nrelated one.\nFutures are the basic building blocks of the economy, essential for\nsociety’s daily functioning. Economic necessities tightly link commoditymarkets and delivery months. If the price of corn, a major animal feed,starts to rise faster than the price of wheat, at some point ranchers willstart using wheat rather than corn. They’ll reduce their purchases ofcorn while buying more wheat, pushing their spread back towards thenorm. A savvy commodity trader knows his normal spreads by heart.Spread traders bet against deviations and for a return to normalcy. Inthis situation, a spreader will short corn and buy wheat, instead of tak-ing a directional trade in either market.\nSpread trades are much safer than directional trades, with even\nlower margin requirements. Amateurs do not understand spreads andhave little interest in these reliable but slow-moving trades. There areseveral books on spreads but not a single good one at the time of thiswriting, a sign of how well professionals have sewn up this area ofknowledge and kept the amateurs out. There is a handful of niches inthe markets where professionals are making fortunes without the ben-efit of a single good how-to book. It looks almost as if the insiders haveposted a sign for the outsiders to keep out.\nCOMMITMENTS OF TRADERS The Commodity Futures Trading Commission\ncollects reports from brokers on the positions of traders and releasestheir summaries to the public. Those COT (commitments of traders)reports are among the best sources of information on what the smartmoney is doing in the futures markets. COT reports reveal positions ofthree groups: hedgers, big traders, and small traders. How do theyknow who is who? Hedgers identify themselves to brokers becausethat entitles them to several advantages, such as lower margin rates.Big traders are identified by holding the number of contracts above“reporting requirements,” set by the government. Whoever is not ahedger or a big trader is a small trader.\nIn the old days, big traders used to be the smart money. Today, the\nmarkets are bigger, the reporting requirements much higher, and bigtraders are likely to be commodity funds, most of them not muchsmarter than the run-of-the-mill trader. Hedgers are today’s smartmoney but understanding their positions isn’t as easy as it seems.\nFor example, a COT report may show that in a certain market,\nhedgers hold 70% of shorts. A beginner who thinks this is bearish may208 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nbe completely off the mark without knowing that normally hedgers\nhold 90% of shorts in that market, making the 70% stance wildly bull-ish. Savvy COT analysts compare current positions to historical normsand look for situations where hedgers, or the smart money, and smalltraders, many of whom are gamblers and losers, are dead set againsteach other. If one group is heavily short while the other is just as heav-ily long, which one would you like to join? If you find that in a certainmarket the smart money is overwhelmingly on one side, while thesmall specs are mobbing the other, it is time to use technical analysisto look for entries on the side of hedgers.\nSUPPLY AND DEMAND MARKETS In futures, there are two types of bull\nand bear markets: supply-driven and demand-driven. Supply-drivenmarkets tend to be fast and furious, whereas demand-driven marketstend to be quiet and slow. Why? Think of any commodity, say coffee,which grows in Africa and South America.\nChanges in demand come slowly, thanks to the conservatism of\nhuman nature. The demand for coffee can go up only if drinkingbecomes more popular, with a second espresso machine in every littlebar. The demand can fall only if coffee drinking becomes less popular,which may happen in a deteriorating economy or in response to ahealth fad. Demand-driven markets move at a leisurely pace.\nNow imagine that a major coffee growing area is hit by a hurricane\nor a freeze. Suddenly the world supply of coffee is rumored to bereduced by 10% and prices shoot through the roof, cutting off marginalconsumers and rising to the point where supply and demand are inbalance. Supply-driven markets are very volatile. Imagine torrentialrains in the cocoa-producing areas of Africa, or a new OPEC policysharply curtailing oil supply, or a general strike in a leading copper-mining country. When the supply of a commodity is reduced andrumors of further damage swirl, the trend shoots up, reallocating tightsupplies to those best able to afford them.\nEvery futures trader must be aware of key supply factors in his mar-\nket and keep an eye on them, such as the weather during the criticalgrowing and harvesting months in agricultural commodities. Trendtraders in the futures markets tend to look for supply-driven markets,while swing traders do better in demand-driven markets. \nThe United States grain markets often have price spikes during the\nspring and summer planting and growing seasons as dry spells, floods,and pests threaten supplies. Traders say that a farmer loses his crop threeTRADING 209\ntimes before harvesting it. Once the harvest is in and the supply is known,\ndemand drives the markets. Demand-driven markets have narrower\nchannels, making profit targets smaller. Channels have to be r edrawn\nand trading tactics adjusted as seasons change. A lazy trader wonderswhy his tools stopped working. A smart trader gets out a new set of toolsfor the season and puts old ones in storage until the next year.\nFLOOR AND CEILING The fundamental analysis of futures is more straight-\nforward than that of stocks. Most analysts monitor supplies since\ndemand changes very slowly. What is the planted acreage? What are\nthe warehouse stocks? What is the weather forecast for the growing areas?Fundamentals put a floor underneath most, though not all, commodi-ties. They also have a natural ceiling above which they almost never rise.\nThe floor depends on the cost of production. When the market price\nof a commodity, be it gold or sugar, falls below that level, miners stopdigging and farmers stop planting. Some third-world governments, des-perate for dollars and trying to avoid social unrest, may subsidize pro-duction, paying locals in worthless currency and dumping the producton the world market. Still, if enough producers go broke and quit, thesupply will shrink and prices will rise to draw in new suppliers. If youtake 20-year charts of most commodities, you’ll see that the same priceareas have served as a floor year after year. Curiously enough, thoselevels have held without being adjusted for inflation.\nThe ceiling depends on the cost of substitution. If the price of a com-\nmodity rises, major industrial consumers will start switching away fromit. If soybean meal, a major animal feed, becomes too expensive, thedemand will switch to fishmeal; if sugar becomes too costly, the demandwill switch to other sweeteners.\nWhy don’t more people trade against those levels? Why don’t they\nbuy near the floor and short near the ceiling, profiting from what issimilar to shooting fish in a barrel? First of all, the floor and the ceilingare not set in stone, and markets may briefly violate them. Even moreimportantly, human psychology works against those trades. Most spec-ulators find it impossible to sell short a market that is boiling near thehigh or go long a market after it has crashed.\nSEASONALS Most commodities fluctuate through the seasons. For\nexample, grains tend to be cheapest soon after the harvest, when thesupply is plentiful and the demand pretty well known. The spring210 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nplanting season, when the coming weather is uncertain, is the most\nlikely time for price spikes. Freezing spells in the northern parts of theUnited States are bullish for heating oil futures. Orange juice futuresused to have wild runups during the frosts in Florida, but have becomemuch more sedate with the growth of orange production in Brazil inthe Southern Hemisphere.\nFor some, seasonal trading degenerates into calendar trading.\nSpinning past data to find that a certain market should be bought dur-ing the first week of March and sold on the last week of August is amisuse of technology. It is easy to find what worked in the past, butany pattern that has no justification in the fundamentals or mass psy-chology probably is due to market noise. Seasonal trades take advan-tage of annual swings, but you have to be careful. They shift fromyear to year, and seasonal trades must be put through the filter of tech-nical analysis. \nOPENINTEREST All exchanges report trading volumes, but futures\nexchanges also report open interest, that is, the number of contracts out-standing on any given day, reported a day later. In the stock marketthe number of outstanding shares doesn’t change, unless a companyissues more or repurchases existing ones. In the futures markets, anew contract is created whenever a new buyer and a new seller cometogether. If both of them get out of their positions, a contract dis-appears. Open interest goes up and down each day, and its changesprovide important clues to the commitments of bulls and bears.\nEvery futures contract has a buyer and a seller, a winner and a loser.\nRising open interest shows more winners are coming into that market.Just as important, it shows more losers are coming in, because withouttheir money there would be nothing for winners to win. An uptrend inopen interest reflects a rising level of commitment on all sides and indi-cates that a trend is likely to continue. A downtrend in the open inter-est shows that winners are taking away their chips, while losers areaccepting losses and quitting the game. Falling open interest showsthat the trend is becoming weaker, which is a valuable piece of infor-mation when you need to decide whether to stay or take profits.\nSHORTING Few traders active today were in stocks in 1929, but the after-\nshocks of that year’s crash still impact us. The government respondedto the hue and cry of the hurt and angry public. Among its many actsTRADING 211\nwas an attempt to root out evil short sellers, accused of driving stocks\ndown. It promulgated the uptick rule, which allows shorting a stock\nonly after it has ticked up. The bad bears can no longer hammer downinnocent stocks with their sell orders. They may only sell short stocksthat are rising. How about a parallel law to outlaw buying stocks thathave ticked up and permitting people to buy only after a downtick, toprevent excessive bullishness?\nThe uptick rule is an example of a bad law passed in response to\nmass hysteria. It is short-sighted because during bear moves it is theshort sellers who break declines with their profit taking. There is nouptick rule in the futures markets. A futures trader is much more likelyto be comfortable shorting than a stock trader.\nIn stocks, most people are long and very few are short. Exchanges\nreport short interest each month, which almost never rises into doubledigits. In futures, short interest is always 100%—there is a short con-tract for every long because if someone is buying a contract for futuredelivery, someone else has to sell them a contract for future delivery,that is, go short. You have to feel comfortable shorting if you want totrade futures.\nLIMITMOVES Now that the stock market has its own “circuit breakers,”\nfewer newcomers to futures are shocked to discover that most havedaily limits beyond which prices are not allowed to go. Limits aredesigned to prevent hysterical moves and give people time to rethinktheir positions, but they have a downside. Just like a pedestrian can getcrushed against a traffic barricade put up to protect him, a trader canget crushed in a limit move. A string of limit days is especially terrify-ing, as a loser is stuck, unable to get out, while his account is beingdestroyed.\nFears of limit moves are greatly overdone. Their heyday was during\nthe inflationary 1970s, and the markets have become much morepeaceful since then. If you trade with the trend, a limit move is muchmore likely to go in your favor, not against. With the globalization ofthe futures markets, many more emergency exits appeared, allowingyou to unwind a trade elsewhere. A good trader learns to find thoseexits before he needs them. Last but not least, a futures trader mayconsider opening an “insurance account,” as recommended above fornaked options writers, albeit on a much smaller scale.212 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nMINICONTRACTS Futures traders with tiny accounts sometimes ask\nwhether they should trade regular contracts or minicontracts. Forexample, a regular contract of S&P represents $250 times the index,but a minicontract is only one-fifth its size, representing $50 timesthe index. In British pounds a regular contract represents £62,500, buta minicontract only one-fifth its size represents only £12,500. Mini-contracts trade during the same hours as regular contracts and closelytrack them in price.\nThe only advantage of minis is the reduction of risk, but their com-\nmissions take a bigger percentage from each trade. Beginners may usethem for practice, but full-size contracts are much better trading vehicles.\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?The Futures Game by Teweles and Jones\nhas educated several generations of futures traders.

Don’t tell me, just\nshow your trading records. Don’t have good records? Well, that’s\nan answer in itself. If you keep records, then the slope of your equitycurve will show how serious you are about trading.\nMost people enter the markets for the money, but soon loose track\nof that goal and start chasing some private version of fun. The tradinggame is a lot more interesting than solitaire and feeds dreams of wealthand power. People trade to escape boredom or show off their smarts.There are as many neurotic reasons to trade as there are traders, butonly one realistic one—to make more money than from riskless invest-ments, such as Treasury bills.\nSuccessful trading is based on 3 M’s: Mind, Method, and Money.\nMind is trading psychology, Method is market analysis, and Moneyrefers to risk management. This last M is your ultimate key to success.The slope of your equity curve, which you must draw as a part of yourmoney management process, reflects the state of your mind as well asthe quality of your method.\nAnyone can make money on a single trade or even several trades.\nEven in the casinos of Las Vegas you continuously hear the music ofthe jackpots. Coins pour from the slot machines, making a happynoise, but how many players go back to their rooms with more moneythan they came with? In the markets, almost anyone can make a goodtrade, but few can grow equity.\nMoney management is the craft of managing your trading capital.\nSome call it an art, others a science, but really it is a combination ofboth, with science predominating. The goal of money management isto accumulate equity by reducing losses on losing trades and maxi-\n215\nmizing gains on winning trades. When you cross the street after the\n“Walk” sign lights up, you still glance right and left because some crazeddriver may be barreling toward the crosswalk, sign or no sign. When-ever your trading system gives you a signal, money managementbecomes the equivalent of glancing right and left. Even the mostbeautiful trading system requires money management to make consis-\ntent profits.\nI once met a father and son team of successful money managers.\nThe father began grooming his son for the business while the boy wasstill a teenager. On weekends he used to take him to the track and givehis son $10 for the day. That was his lunch money and betting money.The father spent the day with his cronies, while the kid could come upand ask questions but never got another dollar. He had to make hismoney betting horses and manage his resources if he wanted to eatlunch that day. Learning to handicap horses (technical analysis), man-age his stake (money management), and wait for the best odds (psy-chology) paid off a million-fold after the son joined his father inmanaging a hedge fund.\nA good trading system gives you an edge in the market. To use a\ntechnical term, it provides a positive expectation over a long series oftrials. A good system ensures that winning is more likely than losingover a long series of trades. If your system can do that, you needmoney management, but if you have no positive expectation, noamount of money management will save you from losing.\nFor example, a roulette player has a negative expectation. A roulette\nwheel has 38 slots in the United States and 37 in Europe, but only 36are in play, as the house “owns” the remaining one or two. Since a slotrepresents roughly 2.7% of a wheel, over a period of time the houseskims that much from each game, slowly bleeding players dry. Thereis a primitive money management system called a martingale that has\nplayers start with a minimum bet, usually $1, and double up after eachloss, so that in theory, when they eventually win, they get back all theylost plus $1, and start with $1 again. Martingale does not work in reallife because casinos limit maximum bets. Once your loss runs up tothat limit, a martingale just hits its head on the ceiling and dies. Inblackjack, on the other hand, a very disciplined trader who follows atested strategy and counts cards has a slight edge over the casino, onthe order of 1 or 2 percent, sometimes higher. Here a good card counterneeds money management to keep bets small on iffy hands and dou-ble up on strong hands.216 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nOnce you have a trading system with a positive expectation, you\nmust establish money management rules. Follow them as if your lifedepended on them, because it does. When we lose money, we die astraders.\nWhatever percentage of capital you lose, you must make a greater per-\ncentage to come back. I used to carry a receipt from a car rental agencyto illustrate this point. The receipt showed a charge of $70, followed bya 10% discount, and 10% tax. What was the bottom line? If you said $70,go back to the books! $70 −10% =$63. $63 +10% =$69.30. If 10% is\ntaken away and 10% added, you end up below the starting point. Losingequity is like falling into an ice cave—it’s easy to slide in but hard to clawyour way out because the edges are slippery. What happens when atrader knocks his $10,000 account down to $6,600? He’s down 34% andmust make 50% just to come back to even. How likely is it that a traderwho just dropped a third of his equity will earn 50%? He’s at the bottomof an ice hole. He’ll either die or get a new lease on life from an outsidesource. The key question is whether he learns from his experience.\nMarkets are about as soft as a gladiator fight. Life on the battle-\nfield is m easured in money. Everybody’s fighting to take it away from\nyou—competitors, vendors, and brokers. Losing money is easy; makingit is hard.\nMoney management has two goals: survival and prosperity. The first\npriority is to survive, then to grind out steady gains, and finally, to makespectacular gains. Beginners tend to have those priorities reversed. Theyshoot for spectacular gains but never think about long-term survival.Putting survival first makes you focus on money management. Serioustraders are always focused on minimizing losses and growing equity.\nThe most successful money manager I know keeps saying he’s afraid\nof ending up as a taxi driver. His engineering degree is out of date, hehas no work experience outside the markets, and if he fails as a trader,all he can do is drive a cab. He’s made millions, but still does every-thing in his power to avoid losing money. He is one of the most dis-ciplined people I know. \nNOMATHILLITERATES\nModern society makes it easy to live without counting. Most of usrarely count, having grown accustomed to calculators and digitalscreens on appliances. If you can add up the number of guests at adinner party or figure out how many beers are left in a six-pack afterMONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 217\nyou have drunk two, you’re in good shape. It’s easy to go through life\nwith hardly any arithmetic. Not so in the markets.\nTrading is a numbers game. If you cannot count, you cannot trade.\nYou do not need calculus or algebra, but you must be on easy termswith basic math—adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. In addi-\ntion, you need to calculate percentages and fractions and round offnumbers in order to count fast. Also, you must be at ease with the con-cept of probability. This may sound simple, but it never ceases toamaze me how poorly and slowly most beginners count. All goodtraders are on easy terms with math. They are practical and sharp peo-ple who quickly calculate risks, results, and odds.\nWhat if you’re a product of modern education and need a calcula-\ntor to subtract 26.75 from 183.5 or figure out 15% of 320? You need toeducate yourself. You have to drill yourself in arithmetic. One of theeasiest ways to do so is by counting change when you go shopping.Estimate the total price. Once you give money to a cashier, calculatehow much change you’ll need. Figure out sales tax in your head. Keeppracticing, keep stepping out of the comfortable shell of modern con-sumer society where counting isn’t necessary. Read a couple of popu-lar books on the theory of probability.\nTroublesome? Yes. Time consuming? For sure. Learning to count on\nyour feet is not entertaining, but it’ll help you succeed in trading.\nHow wide is the channel? What is the ratio of the distances to your\nstop-loss and the profit target? If you want to risk no more than 1% ofyour account and the stop is 1.25 points away, how many shares mayyou buy? These and similar questions go to the heart of successful trad-ing. Being able to answer them on the fly gives you a real advantageover the crowd of innumerate amateurs.\nBUSINESSMAN ’SRISK VS . LOSS\nRemember our example of a small businessman who ran a fruit andvegetable stand, selling several crates each day? What if his wholesaleroffered him a crate of some new exotic fruit? He could make moneyon it, but if locals did not like the fruit and it rotted, a single cratewould not hurt his business. It is a normal businessman’s risk.\nNow imagine he bought a tractor-trailer of that fruit at a super low\nprice. If it sold, he could make a quick killing, but if that load rottedon him, it would hurt his business and could endanger his survival. Acrate presented an acceptable risk, but a truckload was a rotten risk.218 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThe difference between a businessman’s risk and a loss is its size rel-\native to the size of your account.\nA businessman’s risk exposes you to normal equity fluctuation, but\na loss threatens your prosperity and survival. You must draw a linebetween them and never cross it. Drawing that line is a key task ofmoney management.\nWhenever you buy a stock and place a stop under it, you limit your\ndollar risk per share. Money management rules limit your total risk onany trade as a whole, allowing you to risk only a small percentage ofyour account. If you know your maximum permitted risk per trade aswell as your risk per share or contract, it is a matter of simple arith-metic to calculate how many shares or contracts you may trade.\nMoney management rules are essential for your survival and success.\nFew traders have the discipline to follow them. Promises are easy tomake while reading a book, but wait until you are in front of thescreen. “This time is different, it’s free money, I’ll give this trade a littleextra room.” The market seduces traders into breaking their rules. Willyou follow yours?\nI was recently invited to chair a panel on market psychology at a\ngathering of money managers. One of my panelists had nearly a billiondollars under management. A middle aged man, he started in businessin his 20s, while working for a naval consulting firm after graduateschool. Bored with his job, he designed a trading system but did nothave enough money to trade it because it required a minimum of$200,000. “I had to go to other people,” he said, “and ask them formoney. Once I explained to them what I was going to do and theygave me money, I had to stick to my system. It would have beenunconscionable to deviate from it. My poverty worked for me.” Povertyand integrity.\nIf you want to trade, you have to accept risks. A nitpicker, obsess-\ning over dimes, is too stiff to place orders. While you accept risks, youmay not accept losses. What is the definition of a loss?\nA loss is a violation of the percentage rules—the 2% and the 6% Rules.\nMarkets kill traders in one of two ways. If your equity is your life, amarket can snap it with a single shark bite, a disastrous loss that effec-tively takes you out of the game. It can also kill like a pack of pira-nhas, with a series of bites, none of which is lethal alone but whichtogether strip an account to the bone. These two money managementrules are designed to protect you from the sharks and the piranhas.MONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 219\nTHE2% S OLUTION —P ROTECTION FROM SHARKS\nUgly losses stick like sore thumbs out of most accounts. Traders who\nreview their records usually find that a single terrible loss or a shortstring of bad losses did most of the damage. Had they cut their lossessooner, their bottom line would have been much higher. Traders dreamof profits but often freeze like deer in the headlights when a losingtrade hits them. They need rules that tell them when to jump out ofharm’s way instead of waiting and praying for the market to turn.\nGood market analysis alone will not make you a winner. The ability\nto find good trades will not guarantee success. No amount of researchwill do you any good unless you protect yourself from the sharks. I’veseen traders make 20, 30, and once even 50 profitable trades in a row,and still end up losing money. When you’re on a winning streak, it’seasy to feel you’ve figured out the game. Then a disastrous loss wipesout all profits and tears into your equity. You need the shark repellentof good money management.\nA good system gives you an edge in the long run, but there is a great\ndeal of randomness in the markets, and any single trade is close to atoss-up. A good trader expects to be profitable by the end of the year,but ask him whether he’ll make money on his next trade and he’ll hon-estly say he doesn’t know. He uses stops to prevent losing trades fromhurting his account.\nTechnical analysis helps you decide where to place a stop, limiting\nyour loss per share. Money management rules help you protect youraccount as a whole. The single most important rule is to limit your losson any trade to a small fraction of your account.\nLimit your loss on any trade to 2% of equity in your trading account.\nThe 2% Rule refers only to your trading account. It doesn’t include yoursavings, equity in your house, retirement account, or money in theChristmas club. Your trading capital is the money you have dedicated totrading. This is your true risk capital, your equity in the trading enter-prise. It includes cash and cash equivalents in the account, plus today’smarket value of all open positions. Your system should make youmoney, while the 2% Rule lets you survive the inevitable drawdowns.\nSuppose you’re trading a $50,000 account. You want to buy XYZ\nstock, currently trading at $20. Your profit target is $26, with a stop at$18. How many shares of XYZ you are allowed to buy? Two percent220 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nof $50,000 is $1,000, the maximum risk you may accept. Buying at\n$20 and putting a stop at $18 means you’ll risk $2 per share. Dividethe maximum acceptable risk by the risk per share to find how manyshares you may buy. Dividing $1,000 by $2 gives you 500 shares. Thisis the maximum number, in theory. In practice, it has to be lowerbecause you must pay commissions and be prepared to be hit by slip-page, all of which must fit under the 2% limit. So, 400 rather than 500shares is the upper limit for this trade.\nI’ve noticed a curious difference in how people react to the 2% Rule.\nPoor beginners think this number is too low. Someone asked me at arecent conference whether the 2% Rule could be increased for smallaccounts. I answered that when he goes bungee jumping, it doesn’tpay to extend the cord.\nProfessionals, on the other hand, often say 2% is too high and they\ntry to risk less. A very successful hedge fund manager recently told methat his project for the next six months was to increase his trading size.He never risked more than 0.5% of equity on a trade—and was goingto teach himself to risk 1%! Good traders tend to stay well below the2% limit. Whenever amateurs and professionals are on the oppositesides of an argument, you know which side to choose. Try to risk lessthan 2%—it is simply the maximum level. \nWhenever you look at a potential trade, check whether a logical\nstop on a round lot or a single contract would keep you on theright side of the 2% Rule. If it would put more money at risk, pass\nthat trade.\nMeasure your account equity on the first of each month. If you start\nthe month with $100,000 in your account, the 2% Rule allows you torisk a maximum of $2,000 per trade. If you have a good month andyour equity rises to $105,000, then your 2% limit for the next monthis—how much? Quick! Remember, a good trader can count! If you have$105,000 in your account, the 2% Rule allows you to risk $2,100 andtrade a slightly bigger size. If, on the other hand, you have a badmonth and your equity falls to $95,000, the 2% Rule sets your maxi-mum permitted risk at $1,900 per trade for the following month. The2% Rule lets you expand when you are ahead and forces you to pullin your horns when you do poorly; it links your trading size to yourperformance. What if you have several trading accounts, for example,one for stocks and another for futures? In that case, apply the 2% Ruleto each account separately.MONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 221\nFutures—OK to Trade Spreadsheet\nImagine two traders, Mr. Hare and Mr. Turtle, both with $50,000\naccounts, who are looking at two futures markets—S&P 500 and corn.The agile Mr. Hare notices that the average daily range in the S&P isabout 5 points, worth $250 each. The daily range in corn is about 5cents, worth $50 each. He quickly figures that if he catches just a halfof a day’s range, he’ll make over $500 per contract in the S&P, whereasthe same level of skill will bring him just a little over $100 in corn. Mr.Hare calls his broker and buys two contracts of the S&P.\nThe cautious Mr. Turtle has a different arithmetic. He begins by set-\nting the maximum risk in his account at 2% or $1,000. Trading the S&P,moving over $1,000 a day with such a small account, is like grabbing avery large tiger by a very short tail. If, on the other hand, he trades corn,he’ll have a lot more staying power. That tiger is smaller and has a longertail, which he can wrap around his wrist. Mr. Turtle buys a contract ofcorn. Who is more likely to win in the long run, Mr. Hare or Mr. Turtle?\nTo find out which futures markets you may or may not trade, meas-\nure your equity against the recent level of market noise. Begin by cal-culating 2% of your account. Measure the level of noise with theSafeZone indicator, calculate its 22-day EMA, and translate that into dol-lars. Do not trade any market whose average noise level is more than1% of your equity. If you follow this rule, you’ll trade relatively sedatemarkets where you can safely place your stops. Why 1% and not 2%?Because your 2% stop will have to be more than the average noiselevel away from the market.\nThe first column in the spreadsheet in Table 7.1 lists the market, the\nsecond the value of one contract, the third the current SafeZone indi-cator, and the fourth multiplies SafeZone by two. The fifth column lists2% of the account value, in this case $30,000. The last column com-pares the value of SafeZone multiplied by two to 2% of the account. Ifthe latter is greater than the former, that market is OK to trade.\nThe values in Table 7.1 are current as this is being written, but have\nto be updated monthly because volatility changes and SafeZone with it.The exchanges occasionally modify contracts and change unit values.Use this table only as an example and a starting point. Do your home-work, plug in the current numbers, and find out which contracts youmay or may not trade.\nIf you cannot afford to trade a certain market, you can still download\nit, do your homework, and paper trade it as if you were doing it with222 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTable 7.1 OK to Trade Spreadsheet\nUnit 2% of OK to \nFuture value SafeZone SafeZone •2 $30,000 trade?\nBonds $1,000 0.33 $660 $600 No\nEuro$ $2,500 0.09 $450 $600 YesS&P $250 10.00 $5,000 $600 No\nSF $1,250 0.40 $1,000 $600 No\nJY $1,250 0.38 $950 $600 NoDM $1,250 0.26 $650 $600 NoC$ $1,000 0.21 $420 $600 Yes\nSugar $1,120 0.11 $246 $600 Yes\nCotton $500 0.63 $630 $600 NoCoffee $375 1.70 $1,275 $600 NoCocoa $10 24.00 $480 $600 Yes\nUnleaded $420 1.84 $1,546 $600 No\nHeating $420 2.11 $1,772 $600 NoCrude Oil $420 0.76 $638 $600 No\nSilver $5,000 0.09 $900 $600 No\nGold $100 1.80 $360 $600 YesCopper $250 1.05 $525 $600 Yes\nWheat $50 2.60 $260 $600 Yes\nCorn $50 2.50 $250 $600 YesBeans $50 6.50 $650 $600 NoBeanoil $600 0.30 $360 $600 Yes\nBeanmeal $100 2.60 $520 $600 Yes\nreal money. This will prepare you for the day when your account grows\nbig enough or the market grows quiet enough for you to jump in.\nTHE6% R ULE—P ROTECTION FROM PIRANHAS\nIt used to puzzle me why institutional traders as a group performedso much better than private traders. An average private trader is a 50-year-old married, college-educated man, often a business owner or aprofessional. You would think this thoughtful, computer-literate, book-reading individual would run circles around some loud 25-year-oldwith minimal training who used to play ball in college and hasn’t reada book since his junior year. In fact, the lifetime of most private tradersMONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 223\nis measured in months, while institutional traders continue to make\nmoney for their firms year after year. Is it because of their fast reflexes?Not really, because young private traders wash out just as fast as olderones. Nor do institutional traders win because of training, which isskimpy in most firms.\nInstitutional traders who make a lot of money sometimes decide to\ngo out on their own. They quit the firm, lease the same gear, tradethe same system, stay in touch with their contacts—and fail. A fewmonths later, most cowboys are back in head-hunters’ offices, lookingfor a trading job. How come they make money for the firms but not forthemselves?\nWhen an institutional trader quits his firm, he leaves behind his man-\nager, the person in charge of discipline and risk control. That managersets the maximum risk per trade for each trader. That is similar to whata private trader can do with the 2% Rule. Firms operate from huge cap-ital bases, and the risk limit is much higher in dollar terms but tiny inpercentage terms. A trader who violates that limit is fired. A privatetrader can break the 2% Rule and hide it, but a manager watches histraders like a hawk. A private trader can throw confirmation slips in ashoebox, but a trading manager quickly gets rid of impulsive people.He saves institutional traders from disastrous losses, which destroymany private accounts.\nIn addition, a trading manager sets the maximum allowed monthly\ndrawdown for each trader. When an employee sinks to that level, histrading privileges are suspended for the rest of the month. We all gothrough cycles. Sometimes we’re in gear with the markets, and every-thing we touch turns to gold. At other times we are out of sync, andeverything we touch turns into a completely different substance. Youmay think you’re hot, but when you keep losing, it is the market’s wayof saying you’re cold.\nMost private traders on a losing streak keep trying to trade their\nway out of a hole. A loser thinks a successful trade is just aroundthe corner, and that his luck is about to turn. He keeps putting on more\ntrades and increases his size, all the while digging himself a deeperhole in the ice. The sensible thing to do would be to reduce your trad-ing size and then stop and review your system. A trading managerbreaks his traders’ losing streaks by forcing them to stop after theyreach their monthly loss limit. Imagine being in a room with co-workerswho are actively trading, while you sharpen pencils and run out for224 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nsandwiches. Traders do all in their power to avoid being in that spot.\nThis social pressure creates a serious incentive not to lose.\nA friend who used to manage a trading department in London had a\nwoman on his team who was a very good trader. Once, she hit a losingstreak and by the middle of the month was nearing her loss limit. Myfriend knew he would have to suspend her trading privileges, but shewas very high-strung and he did not want to hurt her feelings. He founda course on treasury management in Washington, DC, and sent her therefor the rest of the month. Most managers are not so gentle. Gentle orrough, the monthly loss limit saves traders from death by piranha bites—a nasty series of small losses that can add up to a disaster.\nThe piranha is a tropical river fish, not much bigger than a man’s hand,\nbut with a mean set of teeth. It doesn’t look very dangerous, but if adog, a person, or a donkey stumbles into a tropical stream, a pack ofpiranhas can attack him with such a mass of bites that the victim col-lapses. A bull can walk into a river, get attacked by piranhas, and a fewminutes later only its skeleton will be bobbing in the water. A traderkeeps sharks at bay with the 2% Rule, but he still needs pro tection from\nthe piranhas. The 6% Rule will save you from being nibbled to death.\nWhenever the value of your account dips 6% below its closing value\nat the end of last month, stop trading for the rest of this month.Calculate your equity each day, including cash, cash equivalents, andcurrent market value of all open positions in your account. Stop trad-ing as soon as your equity dips 6% below where it stood on the lastday of the previous month. Close all positions that may still be openand spend the rest of that month on the sidelines. Continue to moni-tor the markets, keep track of your favorite stocks and indicators, andpaper trade if you wish. Review your trading system. Was this losingstreak just a fluke or did it expose a flaw in your system?\nPeople who leave institutions know how to trade, but their disci-\npline is external, not internal. They quickly lose money without theirmanagers. Private traders have no managers. This is why you needyour own system of discipline. The 2% Rule will save you from a dis-astrous loss, while the 6% Rule will save you from a series of losses.The 6% Rule forces you to do something most people cannot do ontheir own—stop losing streaks.\nUsing the 6% Rule, along with the 2% Rule, is like having your own\ntrading manager. Let us review an example of trading using these rules.MONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 225\nFor simplicity’s sake, let us assume we’ll risk 2% of equity on any given\ntrade, even though in reality we try to risk less.\nAt the end of the month, a trader calculates his equity and finds that he\nhas $100,000 and no open positions. He writes down his maximumrisk levels for the month ahead: 2% or $2,000 per trade and 6% or$6,000 for the account as a whole.\nSeveral days later the trader sees a very attractive stock, A, figures out\nwhere to put his stop, and buys a position that puts $2,000, or 2% ofhis equity, at risk.\nA few days later he sees stock B and puts on a similar trade, risking\nanother $2,000.\nBy the end of the week he sees stock C and buys it, risking another $2,000.The next week he sees stock D, which is more attractive than any of the\nthree above. Should he buy it? No, because his account is alreadyexposed to 6% risk. He has three open trades, risking 2% on each, andhe may lose 6% if the market goes against him. The 6% Rule prohibitshim from risking any more at this time.\nA few days later, stock A rallies and the trader moves his stop above\nbreakeven. Stock D, which he was not allowed to trade just a few daysago, still looks very attractive. May he buy it now? Yes, he may, becausehis current risk is only 4% of his account. He is risking 2% in stock B andanother 2% in stock C, but nothing in stock A, because its stop is abovebreakeven. The trader buys stock D, risking another $2,000, or 2%.\nLater in the week, the trader sees stock E, and it looks very bullish. May\nhe buy it? Not according to the 6% Rule, because his account is alreadyexposed to a 6% risk in stocks B, C, and D (he is no longer risking anyequity in stock A). He must pass up stock E.\nA few days later stock B falls and hits its stop. Stock E still looks attrac-\ntive. May he buy it? No, since he already lost 2% on stock B and has a4% exposure to risk in stocks C and D. Adding another position at thistime would expose him to more than 6% risk per month.\nThe 6% Rule protects you from the piranhas. When they start biting\nyou, get out of the water, and do not let the nasty fish nibble you todeath. You may have more than three positions at once if you risk lessthan 2% per trade. If you risk only 1% of your account equity, you mayopen six positions before maxing out at the 6% limit. The 6% Rule pro-tects your equity, based on last month’s closing value and not takinginto account any additional profits you may have made this month.226 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nIf you come into a new month with a big open profit, you have to re-\ncalibrate your stops and sizes so that no more than 2% of your new totalequity level is exposed to risk on any given trade and no more than 6%on all open trades combined. Whenever you do well and the value ofyour account rises by the end of the month, the 6% Rule will allow youto trade a bigger size the following month. If you do poorly and the sizeof your account shrinks, it will reduce your trading size the next month.\nThe 6% Rule encourages you to increase your size when you’re on\na winning streak and stop trading early in a losing streak. If the mar-kets move in your favor, you will move your stops beyond breakevenand put on more positions. If your stocks or futures start going againstyou and hitting stops, you will lose your maximum permitted amountfor the month and stop, saving the bulk of your account to trade thenext month.\nThe 2% Rule and the 6% Rule provide guidelines for pyramiding—\nadding to winning positions. If you buy a stock, it rises, and you movethe stop above breakeven, then you may buy more of the same stock,as long as the risk on the new position is no more than 2% of youraccount equity and your total account risk is less than 6%. Handle eachaddition as a separate trade.\nMost traders go through emotional swings, feeling elated at the highs\nand gloomy at the lows. If you want to be a disciplined trader, the 2%and the 6% Rules will convert your good intentions into the reality ofsafer trading.\nPOSITION SIZING\nA few years ago the owner of a local stock trading firm asked me to runa psychological training group for his traders. They were shocked tohear a psychiatrist was coming and loudly insisted they “weren’t crazy.”The group got off the ground only after the manager told his worst per-formers that they had to join—or else. Once we began to meet andfocus on psychology and money management, the results were suchthat six weeks later we had a waiting list for the second group.\nThe firm used a proprietary day-trading system. It worked so well that\nits two top traders took in more than a million dollars each month. Otherswho used the same system made less, and quite a few lost money.\nIn one of our first meetings a trader complained that he had lost\nmoney each day for the past 13 days. His manager, who sat in on theMONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 227\nmeeting, confirmed that the fellow was following the firm’s system but\ncould not make any money. I began by saying that I would take myhat off for anyone who could lose for 13 days in a row and have theintestinal fortitude to come in and trade the next morning. I then askedhow many shares he traded, since the firm set a maximum for eachtrader. He was permitted to buy or sell 700 shares at a clip, but volun-tarily reduced it to 500 while on his losing streak.\nI told him to drop down to 100 shares until he had two weeks dur-\ning which he had more winning days than losing and was profitableoverall. Once he cleared that hurdle, he could go up to 200 shares.Then, after another two-week profitable period, he could go up to 300shares, and so on. He was allowed a 100-share increment after twoweeks of profitable trading. If he had a single losing week, he’d have todrop back to the previous level until he had a new profitable two-weekperiod. In other words, he had to start small, go up in size slowly, anddrop down fast in case of trouble.\nThe trader loudly objected that 100 shares weren’t enough, and he\nwouldn’t be able to make any money. I told him to stop kidding him-self since trading a bigger size made him no money either, and hereluctantly agreed to my plan. When we met a week later he reportedthat he had four profitable days out of five and was profitable overall.He made very little money because his trading size was so small, buthe was ahead of the game. He continued to make money during thenext week and then stepped up to 200 shares. In our next meeting heasked, “Do you think it could be psychological?” The group roared.Why would a man lose while trading 500 shares, but make money trad-ing 100 or 200?\nI took a $10 bill out of my pocket and asked whether anyone in that\ngroup would like to earn it by climbing on top of our long narrow con-ference table and walking from one end to the other. Several handswent up. Wait, I said, I have a better offer. I’ll give $1,000 cash to any-one who comes up with me up to the roof of our 10-story office build-ing and uses a board as wide as the table to walk to the roof of another10-story building across the boulevard. No volunteers.\nI started egging on the group. “The board will be as wide and sturdy\nas our conference table, we’ll do it on a windless day, and I’ll pay$1,000 cash on the spot. The technical challenge is no harder thanwalking on the conference table, but the reward is much greater.” Stillno takers. Why? Because if you lose your balance on the conference228 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\ntable, you jump down a couple of feet and land on the carpet. If you\nlose your balance between two rooftops, you would be splattered onthe asphalt.\nWhen the level of risk goes up, our ability to perform goes down.Beginners often make money on small trades. They gain a little\nexperience and confidence, increase their trading size—and start los-ing. Their system hasn’t changed, but bigger size makes them a littlestiffer and less nimble. Most beginners are in a hurry to make a killing,and guess who gets killed.\nOvertrading means, among other things, trading a size that is too\nlarge for you. Poor futures traders look for brokers with the lowestmargin requirements. If the minimum margin in gold is $2,000, aneager beaver with $10,000 may buy five contracts. Each includes 100 oz.of gold, making his account swing $500 for every $1 move in gold. Ifgold goes against him, he is cooked. If it goes his way, that beginnerwill be convinced he has discovered a great new way of makingmoney, continue to trade recklessly, and bust out on the next trade.\nUnscrupulous brokers promote overtrading because it generates big\ncommissions. Some stockbrokers outside the United States offer a “shoul-der” of 10:1, allowing you to buy $10 worth of stock for every $1 youdeposit with the firm. Some currency houses offer a shoulder of 100:1.\nWhen a scuba diver jumps off a boat, he has a device called an\noctopus attached to his air tank. It consists of several tubes, one lead-\ning to his mouthpiece, another to his flotation vest, and yet another toan instrument that shows how much air he has left in his tank. If it fallstoo low, he may not have enough to get back to the surface, which iswhy scuba is such a deadly sport for illiterates and hotheads.\nPutting on a trade is like diving for treasure. There is gold below the\nrocks on the ocean floor. As you scoop it up, remember to glance atyour air gauge. How much gold can you take without endangeringyour survival? The ocean floor is littered with the remains of diverswho saw great opportunities.\nA professional diver thinks about his air supply first. If he doesn’t\nget any gold today, he’ll go for it tomorrow. All he needs to do is sur-vive and dive again. Beginners kill themselves by running out of air.The lure of free gold is too strong. Free gold! It reminds me of aRussian saying—the only free thing is the cheese in a mousetrap.\nThere are tribes in Africa that catch monkeys by putting tidbits\nof food into jars with narrow necks, tied to stakes in the ground.MONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 229\nA monkey wiggles its hand into a jar, grabs a tidbit, but cannot pull\nit out because only an open hand can go through the narrow neck.The monkey still tugs at the bait when the hunters come to pickit up. Monkeys lose because of greed, grabbing and refusing to letgo. Think of this when you feel tempted to put on a large trade withno stop.\nA professional trader needs strong money management skills. All\nsuccessful traders survive and prosper thanks to their discipline. The2% Rule will keep you safe from the sharks, the 6% Rule from the pira-nhas. Then, if you have a half-way decent trading system, you’ll be farahead of the game.\nMONEY MANAGEMENT STEPS\nOvertrading—putting on trades that are too large for your account—isa deadly mistake. Beginners are in a hurry to make money, whereasserious traders begin by measuring risks. If you start small and con-centrate on quality, you’ll become a better trader. Once you’ve learnedto trade—find trades, enter, set stops and profit targets, and exit—youcan start increasing your trading size to the point where your accountstarts generating a meaningful income.\nA new trader came to see me recently, a 42-year-old businessman\ntired of the rat race. His wife continued to run their business, while heput all his time and energy into the market. He kept bobbing aroundbreakeven, trading anywhere from 100 to 1,000 shares at a clip. Often,he’d make money on several trades in a row trading small lots andthen give back everything on a single large trade.\nI told him he was ahead of the game because, unlike most begin-\nners, he hadn’t lost money. I then gave him the standard prescription—begin by trading 100 shares, the smallest round lot, until you have aprofitable period during which you have more winners than losers andare profitable overall. That period should be two weeks for a day-trader or two months for a longer-term swing trader. Once you havehad a profitable period, bump up your size by 100 shares and starttrading 200. After another profitable period, go up another 100 sharesand start trading 300. If you have a losing half-period (a week for aday-trader, a month for a swing trader), go back down to your previ-ous trade size and start counting again. If you trade futures, substituteone contract for 100 shares. Advance slowly, retreat fast.230 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nIn his ground-breaking book Portfolio Management Formulas , Ralph\nVince introduced the concept of the optimal f—the optimal fraction of\nyour account to risk in any given trade for maximum long-term gains.His book is mathematically demanding, but it boils down to a few keyconcepts: there is an optimal ffor every trade; if you bet less, your risk\ndecreases arithmetically while profit decreases geometrically; if youkeep betting more than the optimal f, you are guaranteed to go broke.\nThe optimal fkeeps shifting with every trade and is hard to calcu-\nlate. It provides the highest returns in the long run, but it also leads tovicious drawdowns that may exceed 90% of the account. Who has thefortitude to continue trading a system that has brought his accountdown from $100,000 to $9,000? The main value of the optimal fis sim-\nply to remind us that if we trade a size that’s too large, we’ll destroyour account. The optimal fmarks the zone beyond which you walk\ninto a minefield. Stay away from it, trade less than the optimal f.\nBeginners who count profits put their cart before the horse. Reverse\nthat approach and begin by counting risks. Ask yourself what yourmaximum permitted risk is if you follow the 2% and 6% Rules.\nThese are the steps of proper money management:\n1.Measure your account value on the first of the month—the total\nof cash, cash equivalents, and open positions.\n2.Calculate 2% of your equity. This is the maximum you may risk\non any given trade.\n3.Calculate 6% of your equity. This is the maximum you are per-\nmitted to lose in any given month, after which you must close outall trades and stop trading for the rest of that month.\n4.For every trade, decide on your entry point and a stop; express\nyour risk per share or per contract in dollars.\n5.Divide 2% of your equity by your risk per share to find how\nmany shares or contracts you may trade. To get a round number,round it down.\n6.Calculate your risk on all open positions by multiplying the dis-\ntance from the entry point to the current stop by the number ofshares or contracts. If the total risk is 4% of your account or less,you may add another position, since you’ll be adding 2% withyour current trade, bringing the total to 6%. Remember, you donot have to risk 2% per trade; you may risk less if you like.\n7.Put on a trade only after meeting all of the above conditions.MONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 231\nEstablish the size of your trades on the basis of how much money you\ncan afford to risk, not how much you want to make. Follow the 2%and the 6% Rules. If you are having a good month, with most tradesgoing your way, you will move your stops beyond breakeven andwill be allowed to put on more positions. You may even go on mar-gin. The beauty of this money management system is that it clips yourlosses when you are cold and lets you go forward at full throttle whenyou’re hot.\nOn the first of the month, if you have no open positions, the 2% and\n6% levels are easy to calculate. If you approach the first of the monthwith some open positions, calculate your account equity—the value ofall open trades at the latest market price plus all cash or money mar-ket funds. Calculate the 2% and 6% levels on the basis of that number.If you have moved stops beyond breakeven in open trades, you haveno capital at risk and may look for new trades. If your stops are notyet at breakeven, find the percentage of your equity you have exposedto risk and count it against the 6%. Once you deduct that number from6%, the result will let you know whether you may put on new trades.\nHow should you apply the 2% and 6% Rules if you trade futures,\nstocks, and options all at the same time? First of all, a beginner shouldconcentrate on a single market. Diversify only after you succeed. If youare trading more than one market, open separate accounts and treat eachas a separate trading enterprise. For example, if you have $60,000 instocks and $40,000 in futures, calculate the 2% and 6% Rules for the$60,000 and apply them to stocks, and then calculate the 2% and 6%Rules for the $40,000 and apply them to futures. If you have more thanone account, allocate trading-related expenses in proportion to their sizes.\nRemember, both your trading system and your money management\nmust be good in order to win in the markets.232 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nPART\nTHREE\nCOME INTO \nMY TRADINGROOM\nTraders go through several stages of development. Many beginners view\ntrading as a mechanical pursuit. They think that if only they could findthe right parameters for the Stochastic or the proper length for a mov-ing average, success would be theirs. They become easy prey for gurusselling mechanical systems.\nSurvivors realize that psychological factors, such as optimism or\ndoubt, greed or the fear of pulling the trigger are much more impor-tant than any technical indicator. They start developing a feel for theimportance of risk control. I keep running into folks at conferenceswho have a good grip on technical analysis and some understandingof psychology, but who know that something is missing because theycannot win consistently and must keep their day jobs. What shouldthey do next?\nOnce you have a decent understanding of technical analysis, follow\nmoney management rules, and know the value of trading psychology,you need to develop new organizational skills. You already possess thebuilding blocks of success—now is the time to erect the structure ofsuccessful trading.\nThere is no magic trick for converting a serious amateur into a pro-\nfessional trader. What I offer you here is a recipe for intense andfocused work which will enable you to move up to the ultimate stageof professional trading.\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nCHAPTER\nEIGHT\nTHE ORGANIZED TRADER\nWhat is the single most important trait of a successful trader? High\nintelligence? Not really, even though some basic level of per-\nformance is required. Good education? Not quite, since many of thebest traders haven’t gone past high school. The trait that all winnershave in common is a very high level of discipline. How can you meas-ure your level and then increase it? You do it by maintaining and learn-ing from several sets of trading records.\nKeeping good records is the single most important contribution to\nyour success. If you maintain scrupulous records, review them, andlearn from them, your performance will improve. If your money man-agement is in place to ensure survival during the learning process,you’re sure to become a success.\nThese are strong words, but my experience confirms them. In the\nyears of teaching Traders’ Camps, whenever I saw a person with goodrecords, he was either a successful trader or soon became one. I havefound that women tend to keep better records than men, which is oneof the reasons the percentage of winners among them is higher.\nRecords are more important to your success than any indicator,\nsystem, or technical tool. Even the best system is bound to have someholes, but good records will allow you to find them and plug them up.A person who keeps detailed records makes a huge leap in his devel-opment as a trader.\nShow me a trader with good records, and I’ll show you a good\ntrader.\nBad traders keep bad records. People who do not learn from the\npast are doomed to repeat it. “I’ve been hit, insulted, spat upon, andabused—the only reason I stick around is to see what happens next.”\n235\nGood records let you learn from the past instead of struggling from day\nto day. When the market hits you, good records show from where thatblow came. The next time, you’ll take a different path and avoid trou-ble. You may run into a different sort of trouble the next time around,but keep at it long enough and you’ll run out of mistakes. Just be sureyour money management is in place, so that your money doesn’t runout while you are learning. When you start making profits, yourrecords will show how they came about, helping you repeat that expe-rience. Good records reduce guesswork and make trading a muchmore professional exercise.\nRemember the extensive notes you kept in college? Educators agree\nthat keeping notes is an essential part of the learning process. If youare struggling, you must start keeping notes. Once you become a win-ner, you’ll continue to keep them, because they will have become akey part of your trading process. Keeping records is time-consuming.If you get tired or bored and give them up, take that as a sure sign thatyou are gambling rather than trading. Your records are a litmus test ofyour seriousness as a trader.\nA trader needs four types of records. Three of them look back, and\none forward. The trader’s spreadsheet, his equity curve, and his trad-ing diary help review past performance. The spreadsheet rates eachindividual trade, the equity curve tracks your account as a whole, andthe diary reflects your decision-making process. The fourth record is atrading plan for the day ahead. Maintaining these four records puts youon the road toward responsible, professional, successful trading.\nTRADER ’SSPREADSHEET\nThe first step of proper record keeping is setting up a spreadsheet thatlists all your trades. Each horizontal line describes a new trade. Eachvertical column contains a certain detail of each trade or rates an aspectof your performance. These columns belong in any workable trader’sspreadsheet:\n1.Trade number (list all trades in the order of entry)\n2.Entry date\n3.Long or short\n4.Ticker (stock symbol)236 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\n5.Size (how many shares)\n6.Entry price\n7.Commission\n8.Fee\n9.Total (Entry price ×size +commission +fee)\n10.Channel (record the height of the channel on the daily chart or\nwhatever chart you use for your intermediate timeframe; you’lluse it to rate your trade after exiting)\n11Exit date\n12.Exit price\n13.Commission\n14.Fee\n15.Total (Exit price ×size −commission −fee)\n16.P/L (profit or loss—column 15 minus column 9 for longs or the\nopposite for shorts)\n17.Entry grade (see below)\n18.Exit grade (see below)\n19.Trade grade (see below)\nYou may include several additional columns. For example, you may\nwant to record the name of the system that prompted that trade, theinitial stop, and slippage, if any. You can make your spreadsheet reflectmultiple exits as well as record the reasons for exits, such as hittingprice targets or stops, or impatience. You can make your spreadsheetgive you quick summaries of profit and loss or the number of winningand losing trades per market and per system. You can make it showthe average, the smallest, and the greatest profit or loss per trade ineach market and each system.\nThe entry grade (17) rates the quality of your entry by expressing it\nas a percentage of that day’s range. For example, if the high of the daywas 80, the low 76, and you bought at 77, then your entry grade is 25,meaning you bought within the lower 25% of the day’s range. Had youbought at 78, your grade would have been 50. The lower the percent-age while buying, the better. Consistently buying at high numbers canbe ruinous. Try to keep your entry rating below 50. This may not seemlike much, but can be surprisingly difficult to accomplish.\nThe exit grade (18) rates the quality of your exit by expressing it as\na percentage of that day’s range. For example, if the high of the dayTHE ORGANIZED TRADER 237\nwas 88, the low 84, and you sold at 87, your exit grade is 75. It means\nyou captured 75% of that day’s range. Had you sold at 86, your gradewould have been 50. The higher the percentage, the better for theseller. Selling at high numbers is good, while selling at low numbersamounts to charity. Work to get your exit rating above 50.\nThese ratings are important for position traders but even more so for\nday-traders. Just keep in mind that when shorting, you open a trade byselling and close it by buying. Similar ratings apply, as long as youkeep in mind that the sequence of buying and selling is reversed.\nThe trade grade (19) expresses your profit as a percentage of the\nchannel you’ve captured. It is the single most important rating of acompleted trade, much more important than the amount of profit.Subtract column 6 (entry price) from column 12 (exit price) and dividethe result by column 10 (channel width), displaying the result in per-centage format. Reverse the formula when you go short—column 6minus column 12 divided by column 10.\nRating your profit as a percentage of the channel provides an objec-\ntive yardstick of your performance. You can make a lot of money in abig sloppy trade or just a little money in a finely executed trade in adifficult market. Rating each trade on the basis of its channel reflectsyour skill as a trader. If you can capture between 10% and 20% of thechannel, your grade is a C. If your profit exceeds 20% of the channelwidth, you earn a B. And when you take 30% or more out of a chan-nel, you make an A trade!\nAdd an extra column following each rating to calculate your average\ngrades for entries, exits, and completed trades. Graph those numbersand keep doing everything you can to make them trend higher. Ascrupulously maintained trader’s spreadsheet is an active learning tool.It puts you in touch with your successes and failures, creating an islandof stability and responsibility in the ocean of market chaos.\nTHEEQUITY CURVE\nAre you disciplined enough to succeed in trading? Few people can def-initely answer yes or no. Many traders are somewhere in the middle ofthe scale. There is a gauge, a meter that shows whether you’re movingup or down as a trader. That gauge is your account equity. Wheneveryou act responsibly, it turns up, but ticks down with almost every lapseof judgment.238 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nMost traders look at charts, but very few look at themselves. That is\nan oversight, since personality is a hugely important part of trading. Anequity curve holds up a mirror to your performance. Professionals keepequity charts for themselves and their clients. When you start trackingyour equity curve, you make a big step toward joining the pros.\nUse a spreadsheet to track your equity curve. Each horizontal line\nreflects one unit of time, in this case a month. These columns belongin the spreadsheet:\n1.Date\n2.Account equity\n3.2%\n4.6%\nFind your account equity on the last day of each month and type in\nthat figure. Account equity equals all cash and cash equivalents in theaccount, plus the value of all open positions. Mark your account tomarket; your account equity is the liquidation value of your account.Repeat this procedure every month. After accumulating this data forseveral months, begin plotting your equity on a chart. The goal of everyprofessional trader is a smoothly rising equity curve, flowing from thelower left to the upper right with only occasional shallow drawdowns.\nOnce you have accumulated a year’s worth of equity data, add a\nmoving average to your curve. A six-month simple MA will identify thetrend of your equity. It will also answer an important question—whento add money to your account.\nMost people add capital either after damaging losses or when they\nfeel very confident after a string of successes. Adding money after yourequity reaches a new high is emotionally understandable, but it hap-pens to be a bad time to add money. We all go through cycles, and atrader who has just reached a new equity high is due for a pause or apullback. If the moving average of your equity is rising, the best timeto add money is on a pullback to the rising MA. The uptrend of themoving average of your equity confirms that you are a good trader, anda pullback shows a return to value. You buy stocks and futures on pull-backs to their EMAs, so why not use the same tactic when you wantto give yourself more money to trade?\nProgram your spreadsheet to return two important numbers after\nyou type in that month’s equity—the 2% and 6% values. They set twosafety nets for your account for the month ahead. The 2% Rule limitsTHE ORGANIZED TRADER 239\nyour risk on any single trade. Once you find a trade and decide where\nto put a stop, the 2% Rule will give you the maximum number ofshares or contracts you may trade (try to risk less if you can). The 6%Rule takes away your trading privileges for the balance of the month ifyour account value drops to 94% of its previous month-end level.\nYou may enhance this spreadsheet, depending on what you want to\nknow and how good you are at programming. You can use it to cal-culate the monthly curve with and without interest. You can calculateyour curve both before and after trading expenses. You need to recal-culate your curve whenever you add or subtract trading capital with-out mixing up past percentages. The key message—start plotting yourequity curve now!\nYour equity curve is the yardstick of your performance. An orderly\nuptrend is better than a steep uptrend with deep drawdowns. Yourequity curve should keep rising, and if it turns down, you have tobecome much more defensive in your trading.\nTRADING DIARY\nA civilized person is in touch with his past. Understanding what hasgone before helps you deal with the present and face the future. Atrader who keeps a diary can learn from the past instead of mindlesslyrepeating mistakes. A trading diary provides a private mirror, a valu-able feedback loop. It is probably the single best learning tool avail-able to traders.\nA trading diary is both a visual and written record of your trades.\nYou can keep it on paper or in electronic form. I started keeping minesuch a long time ago that I still do it on paper, using scissors anddouble-stick tape to paste up charts. You can follow these instructionsor adjust them and convert your diary into electronic format.\nA trading diary is an album, 11 × 14 inches or bigger. Assign each two-\npage spread to a single trade. Whenever you enter a trade, print out thecharts that led to that trade, and paste them on the left page. Each chartis about 3 × 5 inches, with the weekly on top, followed by one or two\ndailies and sometimes an intraday chart. Write down the name of thestock, the date, and the number of shares bought or shorted. Add a noteon the fundamentals if they had anything to do with that trade. Commenton how you first became aware of that stock—a scan of the database, a240 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\ntip from a friend, or an article in a magazine or a newsletter. This allows\nyou to track the sources of your information. Use a pen to mark indica-tor signals and chart patterns that led you into that trade. Write a fewwords about your feelings entering that trade (anxious, happy, confi-dent, unsure) and note any unusual factors and circumstances.\nI keep my diary at home, and if I trade at the office, I bring my\nprintouts with me and paste them up in the evening. It takes time toclip the charts, tape them into my album, mark them up, and write thecommentary. This discipline reminds me that trading is what I do, andtrading takes priority over almost all other activities.\nRepeat this process after exiting a trade—print out the charts and\npaste them up on the right page of the album. There are usually fewercharts on the right, as the weekly chart does not always figure in theexit. Mark up trading signals and write down your comments on the cir-cumstances of the exit, including your feelings about it.\nAs your diary grows thicker, this visual record of your trades be-\ncomes more and more valuable. Keep going back, leafing through yourdiary. How do those signals look now? What are you happy with, whatwould you have done differently, what lessons have you learned? Mosttraders never ask themselves these questions. When they make money,they swell with pride, and when they lose, they feel angry or ashamed.Wallowing in feelings will not make you a better trader. Our losses canteach us more than our gains. A trading diary helps you put aside self-kicking or self-congratulation and pay attention to the facts. It helpsyou learn and succeed, helps you become free.\nNobody can give you a trading diary. You have to create it yourself,\nand your ability to maintain it will provide a running check of yourdiscipline. Whenever you make some money, leaf through your diaryand ask whether you could have done any past trades differently inlight of what you have just learned. When you lose, do not kick your-self but write a good note on that trade, go back to review past trades,and think how to avoid such losses in the future. Learn from your prof-its and losses.\nTo learn even more, go back to each completed trade approximately\nthree months after an exit and print out the current charts. Tape themto a sheet of paper, mark them up, and attach that flyleaf to your exitpage. Now you can revisit your trades with the benefit of hindsight foran extra dose of trading education.THE ORGANIZED TRADER 241\nWhat if you are a very active trader or day-trader, making so many\ntrades that a diary entry for each is simply impractical? In that case,have a diary entry for every fifth or every tenth trade listed in yourTrader’s Spreadsheet. You can add other trades to your diary if they areespecially important, but be sure to maintain the discipline of everyfifth or every tenth trade.\nKeeping a diary and learning from your trades is as close as you can\ncome to a guarantee of trading success. Be sure to strictly observemoney management rules so that a string of freak losses doesn’t tossyou out of the game while you’re still learning. Follow the rules, keepa spreadsheet, equity chart, and a trading diary, review them, learn fromthem, and you’ll have everything it takes to become a successful trader.\nACTION PLAN\nIt is important to face each day knowing what and how you will trade.This is especially true for position traders, as day-traders must instantlyreact to quotes on their screens.\nA pro does not squint at his charts. Good trades jump at you from\nthe chart and scream—here I am, take me. If you have to squint, thereis no trade and you should move on to the next stock. A good posi-tion trader, or any mature trader for that matter, looks not for the chal-lenges but for the money.\nThe best time to search is in the evenings when markets are closed.\nYou can review your markets in peace, think, check out other stocksand indicators, and then make your decision—to go long, short, orstand aside. Write down your decision and review it in the morningbefore the markets open.\nWhenever you place an order, especially when you give it to the bro-\nker on the phone, it pays to read from a page instead of speaking frommemory. Why? Because almost every trader I know has had the embar-rassing experience, usually more than once, of accidentally reversing anorder. You may want to sell short, but make a slip of the tongue, tellingyour broker to buy, and seconds later find yourself an owner of a col-lapsing stock. Even worse, there is a temptation to change your orderat the last moment—buy more or less than you planned, or switch alimit to a market order. Putting a sheet of paper between yourself andyour broker provides a useful layer of protection.242 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nIt is a good idea to write down some background for each order.\nMy preferred format includes three lines: Weekly, Daily, and To Do.For example:\nWeekly: EMA rising, MACD-H ticked down, deteriorating\nDaily: MACD-H bearish divergence, pullback to the EMA in progressTo Do: Sell short at 71.30 with a stop at 73, target mid-60s\norWeekly: EMA turning flat, MACD-H ticked up from a bullish divergence\nDaily: EMA up, MACD-H rising, all in gear to the upsideTo Do: Buy on a pullback to the EMA at 23.25, stop 22, target high 20s\nI keep these notes in an Excel spreadsheet. It has a line for every\nstock that I track, with dates in vertical columns. Whenever I see atrade, I click on the cell for that date and stock, go to the Insert menu,and select Comment. Once I’ve written my three-line note, a tiny redtriangle appears in the right upper corner of the cell. Whenever youmove your cursor over it, the comment pops up on the screen. Thisrecord-keeping system makes it easy to sweep horizontally and reviewyour entire analytic history of a stock or sweep vertically and reviewall your comments for that day. I keep my records for the ABC ratingsystem, described below, in the same spreadsheet.\nRemember to keep your notes descriptive. If you write something\nlike “weekly charts give a buy signal,” that does not tell you anythingspecific about a stock and will be useless when you look at it a fewdays later. Begin by describing what you see on the weekly charts,move on to the dailies, and only after that write down your tradingideas on the action line.\nKeeping an action plan increases your load of paperwork, but it\nmakes trading more businesslike and less like a swing through acasino. This reminds me of the time I took a group of mostly Americantraders for a mock trading session on the floor of the Russian Exchangein Moscow. Each person was assigned an interpreter and given a paperbankroll. Everybody had a grand time, trading and taking pictures, exceptfor a lone Dutchman in our group. That market maker from Amsterdamkept furiously scribbling on the back of an envelope as he watchedprices on the display panel above the floor. When the session endedand we moved on to the executive dining room, they brought usTHE ORGANIZED TRADER 243\nprintouts with our results. It turned out that the group as a whole lost\na million rubles. The Dutchman made a little over 900,000 rubles, whilethe rest went up in slippage and commissions—a pretty commonoutcome. Good records help create good traders, which is why Iencourage you to invest time and energy in keeping and followingyour action plan.244 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nCHAPTER\nNINE\nTRADING FOR A LIVING\nTrading attracts us with its promise of freedom. If you can trade, you\ncan live and work anywhere in the world, be independent from\nthe routine, and not answer to anybody. You can trade from a beachbungalow or a mountaintop chalet, as long as you have a good Inter-net connection. You have no boss, no customers, no alarm clock. Youare your own person.\nPeople pay lip service to their dreams of freedom, but many feel\nfrightened by it. If I stop making money for any reason whatsoever, nocorporate parent will take care of me. This a frightening thought formost people. No wonder so many of us have grown used to the secu-rity of our corporate cages.\nCaged animals develop all sorts of neurotic behaviors. A common\nneurosis is an addiction to the earn-and-spend cycle. We are taughtsince childhood that our place in society is defined by what we con-sume. If you drive a $50,000 car, you are a better, more successful per-son than someone who drives a $15,000 auto, whereas a neighbor whodrives a $120,000 car is a very special winner altogether. The man whodresses at an Armani boutique is a more refined individual than some-one who buys his pants and shirts at the corner store. Society wavescountless carrots in our faces. The ads sell not food, shelter, or trans-portation, but a boost of self-esteem. An addict feels revived by a fixfor only a short time. People spend their entire lives straining to keepup with the Joneses. Those dastardly Joneses do not have the decencyto stay in place, and as they climb the ladder, we must climb also.\nFreedom begins in our minds, not in our bank accounts. To liberate\nyourself, start becoming conscious of your spending. You are likely to\n245\nsee that you need much less than you thought, making freedom that\nmuch closer.\nThere was a Wall Street analyst by the name of Joe Dominguez who\nsaved enough money to retire at 31. He spent the rest of his life enjoy-ing himself, doing volunteer work, and writing a book called Your\nMoney or Your Life.\nWe aren’t making a living, we are making a dying. Consider the\naverage American worker. The alarm rings at 6:45 and our workingman or woman is up and running. Shower. Dress in the professionaluniform—suits or dresses for some, overalls for others, whites for themedical professionals, jeans and flannel shirts for construction workers.Breakfast, if there’s time. Grab commuter mug and briefcase (or lunchbox) and hop in the car for the daily punishment called rush hour. Onthe job from nine to five. Deal with the boss. Deal with the coworkersent by the devil to rub you the wrong way. Deal with suppliers. Dealwith clients/customers/patients. Act busy. Hide mistakes. Smile whenhanded impossible deadlines. Give a sigh of relief when the ax knownas ‘restructuring’ or ‘downsizing’—or just plain getting laid off—falls onother heads. Shoulder the added workload. Watch the clock. Argue withyour conscience but agree with the boss. Smile again. Five o’clock.Back in the car and onto the freeway for the evening commute. Home.Act human with mates, kids or roommates. Eat. Watch TV. Bed. Eighthours of blessed oblivion.\nAnd they call this making a living? Think about it. How many\npeople have you seen who are more alive at the end of the work daythan they were at the beginning? . . . Aren’t we killing ourselves—ourhealth, our relationships, our sense of joy and wonder—for our jobs?We are sacrificing our lives for money—but it’s happening so slowlythat we barely notice.\nPull out your old tax returns or cash income books and add up all\nearnings since your first job. You’re likely to find that even a moder-ately successful person has earned a million dollars or more. And spentit! Have you ever seen hamsters racing on a treadmill? Wouldn’t it benice to hop off, go for a walk, stop by some flowers and inhale? Mostpeople cannot relax because they are hooked on spending. When theybegin to trade, they set impossible goals. Fifty percent in the first yearis not enough when you crave a downpayment on a Ferrari.\nThere is nothing wrong with owning a Ferrari or any other luxury,\nprovided you have given it a lot of thought and are buying it for a true246 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\npersonal need rather than responding to advertising propaganda.\nPeople keep buying things to shut out their feelings of emptiness anddissatisfaction. A person who uses money to stuff up his sense ofemptiness can hardly focus on finding the best quality trades.\nFind the minimal level of spending which feels comfortable to you.\nTo quote Dominguez again, \nYou have enough for your survival, enough for your comforts, \nand even some special luxuries, with no excess to burden you un-necessarily. Enough is a powerful and free place. A confident andflexible place.\nBecome conscious of your expenditures. Use cash instead of plastic\nwhenever possible. Stop trying to impress people with your posses-sions. They are not paying attention because they are too busy tryingto impress you. Pay off all your debts, including your mortgage. That’snot too hard once you reduce your expenses. Set aside enough moneyto live for 6 to 12 months and loosen the link between work andincome. Trading should be a high-paying, high-integrity self-employ-ment. Once your living expenses are covered, start putting extra prof-its into tax-free bonds so that eventually you’ll have enough income totake care of your normal needs in perpetuity. If tax-free municipalsyield 5%, then $1 million worth of them will bring you $50,000 a year,free and clear. Will that be enough? Will you need twice that much?Three times? Five? The sooner you lower your expenses, the sooneryou’ll reach the moment of liberation. Rationally managing your per-sonal finances prepares you to rationally manage your trading account.\nYou probably did not expect a discussion of personal spending in a\nbook on trading. If it has caught your attention, follow up by readingthe Dominguez book. The key idea for traders is to approach the mar-ket in a sober and rational manner, maximizing gains, minimizinglosses, and being accountable for every step that they take.\nDISCIPLINE AND HUMILITY\nA friend started out as a floor clerk and struggled for eight years beforehis trading took off. Now he is a world-famous money manager, andmany of those who knew him when he was a beginner like to remi-nisce about how he clerked on one of the smaller exchanges in NewYork, taught classes, and struggled to make ends meet. An old traderTRADING FOR A LIVING 247\nsaid to me, “I knew him then, and I thought he would succeed. He had\nthe right combination of being very careful and having this optimismyou need to get up in the morning and believe you’re going to makemoney trading the markets.”\nTo succeed in trading, you need both confidence and caution.\nHaving only one is dangerous. If you’re confident but not cautious,you’ll be arrogant, and that’s a deadly trait for traders. If, on the otherhand, you are cautious but have no confidence, you will not be ableto pull the trigger.\nYou need confidence to say, “This stock is going up, my indicators say\nit will continue to rise, I am going to get long and ride this trend.” At thesame time, you need to be humble enough to put on trades whose sizewill not endanger your account. You have to accept the uncertainty ofthe markets and be ready to take a small loss without quibbling.\nWhen you feel a surge of confidence in a new trade, it is hard to\nthink of the downside risk, but if you don’t do it, you cannot protectyourself. When the market goes against you and hits your predefinedexit level, you have to humbly exit, no matter how confident you feelabout that trade. You need both confidence and humility. The abilityto be aware of two conflicting feelings at the same time is one of thehallmarks of emotional maturity.\nI have a client in New York who came to several seminars and\nbought books and videos from my firm but kept struggling for years asa trader. He’d get ahead, fall behind, get ahead again, then lose moneyand get a job to make ends meet. He often seemed on the verge ofsuccess, but kept bouncing around breakeven. Then one day, I raninto him at a conference and saw a changed man. He was doingsupremely well, managing about $80 million, with terrific grades fromthe rating agencies. A few weeks later I stopped by his office.\nHe had continued using the same trading system, developed years\nago and derived from Triple Screen. He had made only one change.Instead of second-guessing the system, he came to see himself as aclerk. He imagined he had a boss who went to Tahiti and left him totrade the system. The boss will return and give him a bonus, depend-ing not on profits, but on how faithfully he followed the system. Myclient stopped trying to be a hot-shot trader and moved into a positionof humility and discipline. That’s when he rose to sweeping success.\nSecond-guessing a system is a terrible error that creates a huge level\nof uncertainty. Tom Basso, a prominent money manager, says that it is248 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nhard enough to figure out what the market is going to do; if you do\nnot know what you’re going to do, the game is lost.\nChoose your system, set up your money management rules, test\neverything. Run the system each night, write down its signals, and readthose messages to your broker in the morning. Do not improvise whenquotes flash in front of your face because they hypnotize you andprompt you to put on impulsive trades.\nWhat if the markets change and your system starts missing good\nmoves or chewing up equity? Well, you should have tested it over along enough stretch of data to feel confident about its long-term per-formance. Your money management rules will help you ride out a roughstretch. Be very conservative with an existing system. If you’re f eeling\nrestless, design a new system and trade it in a different account—leavewhat works alone.\nTrading demands discipline, but, paradoxically, attracts impulsive\npeople. Trading requires practice, humility, and perseverance. Success-ful traders are strong but humble people, open to new ideas. Beginnerslike to brag, experts like to listen.\nTen Points\nWhen a beginner puts on a trade too big for his account, and it startsto swing, it floods him with adrenaline. An upswing gives him enoughmoney to dream about moving to easy street. Feeling elated, he missesthe signals of a top and gets caught in a downside reversal. A down-swing puts him into such a state of fear that he misses the signals of abottom and sells out right near the lows. Beginners pay more attentionto their emotions than to the reality of the markets. \nOnce you begin to develop discipline, you start seeing much more\nclearly what happens outside of your little account and in the great bigmarket out there. When you see the market freeze in a flat tradingrange or explode in a vertical rally, you know what the masses oftraders feel, because you have been there. When a market goes flat,and amateurs lose interest, you know that a breakout is coming. Youwere once that amateur, you overlooked breakouts because you gotbored and stopped watching the markets. Now, when the market goesflat, you recognize the way you used to be, and are ready to act.\nThe market surges to a new high, pauses for a day, and goes verti-\ncal. The newspapers, radio, and TV are screaming about the new bullTRADING FOR A LIVING 249\nmarket. If you are a disciplined trader, you remember how, years ago,\nyou bought within a few ticks of the top. This time is different. Youreach for the phone and start taking profits on positions acquiredwhen the market looked boring and flat. Understanding yourself andthe path you have traveled allows you to read the market and beatyour competitors.\nHow do you know that you are becoming a disciplined trader?You keep accurate records. You maintain the minimum of four\nrecords—a trader’s spreadsheet, an equity curve, a trader’s diary, andan action plan. You scrupulously keep your records up to date andstudy them to learn from your experiences.\nYour equity curve shows a steady uptrend with shallow drawdowns.\nThe performance standard for professional money managers is 25%annual gain on the account, with no drawdowns of more than 10%from peak equity. If you can match or exceed that, you are far aheadof the game.\nYou make your own trading plans. Even when you get a terrific-\nsounding tip from a friend, you do not get swept up in the excitement.You either ignore it or put it through your own decision-making screens.\nYou do not chat about your trading. You may discuss a technical\npoint or a closed trade with a trusted friend, but you never ask for ad-vice on an open trade. You do not disclose your positions so as not toexpose yourself to unwanted advice or tie up your ego in the process.\nYou learn all you can about the market you’re trading. You have a\ngood grasp of the main technical, fundamental, intermarket, and polit-ical factors that may impact your stock or a future.\nYou grade yourself on the adherence to your written plan. Imagine\nyou are an employee, and the boss has left on an extended vacation,leaving you to manage his money by following his plan. When he re-turns he will reward or punish you based on how faithfully you fol-lowed his plan.\nYou allot a certain amount of time to the markets each day. You\ndownload data each day, put it through your battery of tests andscreens, and write down the results and plans for tomorrow. You allo-cate time in your daily schedule to make trading a regular activity andnot something you do catch as catch can.\nYou monitor selected markets daily, regardless of their activity. You\navoid the typical beginners’ error of monitoring markets only when250 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nthey are active and “interesting.” You know that strong moves spring\nfrom periods of relative inactivity.\nYou learn and are open to new ideas, but are skeptical of claims. You\nread market books and magazines, attend conferences, participate inonline forums, but you do not accept any ideas without testing them onyour own data.\nYou follow your money management rules as if your life depended\non them—because your financial life does. If you have good money\nmanagement, most decent trading systems will make you money in thelong run.\nHAVEYOUGOT THE TIME?\nAll traders pay attention to money but few are aware of the importanceof time. Time is just as crucial as money—the more you have, the morelikely you are to win.\nMost people start out with too little money, and most traders do not\ngive themselves enough time to learn. Trading is very different fromphysics or mathematics, where genius reveals itself early. In science, ifyou’re not a star by the time you’re 25, you’ll never be one. Trading,on the contrary, is an old man’s game, and now increasingly a woman’s.Patience is a virtue and memory a great asset. If you slightly improve\neachyear, you can grow into a brilliant trader.\nMy friend Lou Taylor, to whom Trading for a Living was dedicated,\nused to say, “if I become half a percent smarter each year, I’ll be agenius by the time I die.” As always with him, there was a great deal ofwisdom in his joke.\nRaise your eyes from the keyboard and think about two goals—to\nlearn to trade and to make money. Which comes first and which comessecond? Stop killing yourself trying to make a lot of money in a hurry.Learn to trade, and the money will follow. An intelligent horse trainerdoes not overload a young horse. Training comes first, pulling heavyloads comes later.\nYou learn best by making many small trades and analyzing your per-\nformance. The more you trade, the more you learn. Play for small stakesto reduce the pressure and concentrate on quality. You can always in-crease your size later. The goal is to acquire enough experience so thatmost actions become nearly automatic. A trader whose experience hasTRADING FOR A LIVING 251\ntaught him a lot of practical skills can focus on strategy—what he\nwants to do—instead of worrying about his next step.\nIf you are serious about trading, you have got to put time into it.\nMarkets have to be studied, trading methods dissected and rated, sys-tems designed and applied, decisions made and recorded. All of thisadds up to a fair bit of work. What is a fair bit? Two examples cometo mind, at opposite ends of the spectrum.\nAt the hard-working end, I think of a top-rated American futures\nmoney manager in whose apartment I once stayed. We lived under thesame roof, but I hardly ever saw him. He would leave for the officebefore 7 \nA.M., return after 10 P.M., and fall asleep in his clothes in the\nliving room. He worked like that six days a week, but on a Sunday hetook it easy. In the morning he would go for a game of squash at aclub before running back to the office to prepare for the opening onMonday. No wife, no girlfriend, no pastimes, and no friends—but man,was he raking in millions!\nAt the relaxed, but still very disciplined end, I think of a middle-\naged Chinese trader whom I visited in his mansion when the stockmarkets were reeling throughout Asia. He had made a fortune in thetwo bull markets of the previous 10 years and told me that he neededjust one more Asian bull market to make all the money he wanted. Hewas prepared to wait for several years for the next one, but mean-while looked after his family, collected art, and played a lot of golf.He spent a few hours a week downloading the data and watching hisindicators.\nHow much time should you spend analyzing markets and doing\nyour homework? A beginner must spend every minute of his wakinghours learning the basics. How much time will you need at the nextstage, once you’ve become a competent semiprofessional trader? Weare talking about position trading and not day-trading, which forcesone to stay in front of the screen all day. The answer depends on howfast you work and how many markets you trade.\nYou must dedicate a certain amount of time to the markets each day.\nAmateurs and gamblers make a typical mistake. When markets areinactive, they stop watching and lose touch. They wake up after hear-ing the news of a runaway move. By that time, the markets are run-ning—the amateurs have missed yet another train and now they chaseit, hoping to hop aboard a runaway trend.252 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nAn organized trader tracks his markets, whether he trades them at\nthe moment or not. He notices when a listless range starts rubbingagainst a resistance, buys early, and when amateurs start piling into therally, he takes profits, selling to lazy latecomers. A serious trader isahead of the game because he does his homework day in and day out.\nHow much time will you need? For every stock you must get a handle\non its key fundamentals, including its industry group. For futures, thereare the additional factors of supply and demand, seasonals, and spreadsbetween delivery months. You need to make a calendar of events thatmay impact your market, such as Federal Reserve announcements orearnings reports. You need to study weekly charts for the past severalyears and daily charts for at least a year. You need to apply indicators,learn which work best with that market, and test their parameters.\nUnless you are a genius or a speed demon, it is hard to accomplish\nthis in less than two hours. And that is just an entry fee into any trad-ing vehicle. Afterward the daily grind begins. A serious trader reviewsweekly and daily charts each day. You have to compare your marketwith other related ones. You have to make daily notes and write downyour plans for the day ahead. To do this properly, you’ll need at least15 minutes per stock or future.\nAnd this is in a fairly routine day. What about the day when your\nmarket hits support or resistance, or breaks out of its trading range, anda trade seems imminent? Then you might spend closer to an hour ana-lyzing it, measuring risk and reward, and deciding on your entry pointsand profit targets.\nSo let us turn the question around: If you have an hour a day for\nanalysis, how many markets should you follow? Three, maybe four. Ifyou have two hours, you may be able to follow six, eight, or even ten.The ABC system for organizing homework may allow you to doublethe number of markets. Whatever you do, remember, quality is moreimportant than quantity.\nBefore you add a stock to your list, decide whether you have enough\ntime to track it, day in and day out. You may skip a day once in a while,but even then you should at least glance at your markets. Daily home-work is essential, and the number of markets you may follow dependson how much time you have each day. When we get out of touch, wegrow cold. Even professionals take a few days to get back in touch withtheir markets after a vacation. These are the stages of development:TRADING FOR A LIVING 253\nBeginner: At the start, track approximately six, but no more than 10\ntrading vehicles. You can always add more later. It is better to start withfewer markets and follow them well than to start with a lot and fallbehind.\nDaily homework is essential for developing a feel for the markets.\nAllocate time to study your markets each day. Even if you come homelate at night from your job or a party, you can still find 10 minutes todownload the data and glance at your five or six stocks. You canupdate your mental picture of them even if you don’t plan to tradethem tomorrow. A beginner who follows too many stocks bites offmore than he can chew, falls behind, and becomes demoralized. Betterto follow a small number, get to know them well, and add more later.\nIntermediate: You may track several dozen stocks or futures at this\nstage. Analyzing each will take just as much time as it did when youwere a beginner, but you’ll analyze them more deeply. A serious ama-teur or a semiprofessional trader can use his time more efficiently withthe help of the ABC Rating System (see next page).\nSome good traders choose not to expand the number of stocks or\nfutures they trade. A person might concentrate only on soybeans andtheir products, or only currencies, or only five or six technology stocks.In addition to analyzing your markets, expect to spend a minimum offive to six hours a week reading books and articles and interacting withother traders on the Internet.\nAfter about a year or longer at this stage you will face an important\nchoice: to treat trading as a mildly profitable hobby or to try to rise tothe professional level. In that case, you will need to dedicate more timeto trading. You will have to make sacrifices in other areas of your lifeand spend at least four to six hours a day working in the markets.\nProfessional: people who trade for a living tend to drop other profes-\nsional interests. The markets demand time and attention, and moneymanagement is more challenging because the account is much bigger.\nA professional trader almost always uses some version of the ABC\nRating System, unless he chooses to trade just a handful of markets.He spends more time researching the markets. At the same time, hereviews them faster, thanks to his greater level of expertise. He spendsseveral hours each week reading, deepening his analysis and improv-ing his money management, and also keeping track of new develop-ments on the Internet.254 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nThe rewards are very good at this stage, but a professional who has\nput years into getting there does not become intoxicated with theresults. He lives very well, but continues to work harder than mostbeginners. Traders at this level love the markets and derive a great dealof satisfaction from them, like skiers enjoy tall mountains.\nManaging Time with the ABC Rating System\nMarkets generate colossal volumes of information. No human canprocess all the available data. No one can have in mind all the funda-mental values, the economic trends, the technical indicators, the intra-day action, and the buying and selling by insiders and market makerswhile making a trading decision. We want to be thorough in ourresearch, but it can never be complete. We need to select a relativelysmall number of markets and design a trading plan in order to chan-nel the incoming information into a more manageable stream.\nTrading is not about being brilliant, not about making forecasts, and\nnot about scanning a huge universe of trading vehicles. Trading isabout managing—our capital, our time, our analysis, and ourselves. Ifwe manage right, we’ll grind out profits.\nManaging time is an important aspect of success. Find out how\nmuch time you need, depending on your personal style, to research anew market and track it daily. The ABC Rating System is designed todeliver major time savings, allowing you to track and trade more mar-kets in the same time. This system is not for beginners, but an inter-mediate or expert trader can definitely benefit from it.\nThe ABC Rating System, shown to me by D. Guppy, is a system for\nmanaging time. It helps us concentrate on the markets in which a tradeseems imminent and spend less time in less promising markets. TheABC system calls for a quick weekly review of all stocks or futures thatyou track and sorting them into three groups: A for those you think youmight trade tomorrow, B for those you think you may trade later in theweek, and C for those you do not expect to trade in the coming week.\nThe best time to run the ABC system is on weekends, after you have\ndownloaded all your data. Prepare a spreadsheet with a horizontal linefor every stock or future you follow. Put their names in the left column.Use vertical columns to record your A, B, and C ratings, one columnper day. Prepare the weekly and daily templates in your trading soft-ware. Drop the first market into the weekly template. Does it look likeTRADING FOR A LIVING 255\nyou might want to trade this stock tomorrow? For instance, if you only\ntrade from the long side and the weekly chart is in a solid downtrend,you will not trade it next week. In that case, mark it with a C and moveon. Drop the next market into your weekly template. If it looks like apossible trade, then drop it into your daily template. Does it look likeyou might want to trade it on Monday? If so, put an A into your spread-sheet. If it looks like an unlikely trade on Monday but possibly laterthat week, put a B in your spreadsheet. Now move to the next marketand drop it into the weekly template. Repeat this process until you gothrough your entire list.\nKeep a good pace, do not slow down. You should be done with\neach market in well under one minute. Remember, good trades shouldleap at you from the screen and grab you by the face—it’s me, trademe! If you have to squint at a chart, there’s probably no trade.\nThe real work begins after you have filled in your ABC spreadsheet.\nNow you must study each stock or future you have marked with an A.Apply your trading system, set up entry levels, stops, and profit targets,and write down your orders for the day ahead. Do this for every mar-ket you have rated an A, leaving aside all others. After the closing onMonday, go through all your A-rated markets. If you have enteredthem, fill in a page in your trading diary and continue to manage thosetrades according to your plan. If your entry orders have not been trig-gered, review those markets again—do you still want to enter onTuesday? Filtering out B and C groups saves time and lets you con-centrate on the most promising trades.\nRepeat the procedure after the closing on Tuesday, but now also\nreview the markets you rated B over the weekend. Now is the time todecide whether you can upgrade them to an A and start monitoringthem daily or downgrade them to a C and leave them alone until theweekend.\nEarlier, we reviewed the action plan, a spreadsheet for recording your\norders for the day ahead. That and the ABC system lend themselves tobeing combined into a single spreadsheet. Each horizontal line holdsa trading vehicle, and each vertical column one trading day. The cellsare filled with the letters A, B, or C, indicating your rating for that stock orfuture for the day ahead. Red triangles in the corners identify those cellsin which you have inserted comments that tell you how to trade them.\nBoredom is the trader’s enemy. It is hard to watch a market day after\nday while it goes nowhere. A professional must track his markets, but256 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nno one enjoys watching paint dry. The ABC system provides an ele-\ngant solution. It lets you monitor all your markets in a quick and effi-cient manner, while dedicating most of your time and attention to themost promising trades. Once you get used to applying the ABC system,you can easily double the number of markets you follow and increaseyour trading opportunities.\nTHEDECISION -MAKING TREE\nA professional trader takes the markets seriously and gives them thetime and attention they deserve. If you have read this far, you are prob-ably more dedicated than the average person. Now is the time to zeroin on your plan of action.\nYou need to allocate a certain time to market work each day; keep-\ning in close touch with the market is essential for success. You have todecide what markets to trade and focus on a select few to be success-ful. You need to design a plan for your education. Last but not least,you need to design your trading plan; a written plan is the hallmark ofa serious trader.\nDesigning a Trading Plan\nTraders go through three stages of development. We all start out asbeginners. Some of us survive long enough to become serious ama-teurs or semipros, and a few rise to the expert level. A trader with agood written plan shows a rising level of development.\nA beginner never writes down a plan because he has nothing to\nwrite. He is having too much fun chasing hot tips and trying to makea quick killing. Even if he wanted to write, he wouldn’t know where tobegin. A serious amateur or a semipro who writes down a plan, includ-ing money management rules, is on his way toward the expert level.\nThe main difference between a trading plan and a mechanical sys-\ntem is the degree of freedom it allows traders. Trading systems arerigid, whereas plans lay down the main rules but leave you free to useyour judgment.\nSome beginners gain a false sense of security from pouring tons of data\ninto mechanical systems and finding sets of rules that would have workedin the past. The markets are live social organisms that develop, grow, andchange. Rigid rules fitted to past data are not likely to perform well in theTRADING FOR A LIVING 257\nfuture. If mechanical systems could work, the best programmers would\nhave owned the markets by now. All mechanical trading systems, leftalone, self-destruct with the passage of time. Promoters keep selling thembecause the public loves marketing gimmicks.\nA trading plan includes a few unbreakable rules along with more\nflexible recommendations that call for an exercise of judgment. Yourjudgment grows with experience. A trading plan includes the princi-ples for selecting markets, defines the types of trades, generates buyand sell signals, and allocates trading capital. When you write a plan,avoid the temptation to make it all-encompassing. Know when to stop.Write down your rules but indicate where you will use your judgmentat the moment of decision.\nYou must know what type of trading appeals to you. A general\nidea—to make money buying and selling—is not specific enough.Winners make money in different ways, while all losers fall into thesame wastebasket of impulsivity. A long-term fundamental investor,like Peter Lynch, searching for his elusive “10-bagger”—a stock thatrises 10-fold—acts differently from a successful short-term trader whogoes short to sell him that stock. Both may succeed in the long run,but the floor trader with a 30-minute time horizon will close his shortson a tiny but profitable dip before the end of the day, just as surely asthe long-term investor will hold on to his longs.\nA trading plan reflects your interests in specific markets and tech-\nniques, your experience, and the size of your account. It reflectsyour personality as well as the behavior of your markets. If twofriends with equal capital and similar experience traded the samemarket and wrote down their plans, they would come up with differ-ent outlines. You may create more than one plan if you like differenttypes of trading.\nIf you do not have a plan, start working on one. Drafting an intelli-\ngent plan requires a huge amount of work. The first time I tried to doit was on a flight from New York to Los Angeles. I thought that fivehours in the air would be enough. A month later I was still at it.\nHere are two fairly basic outlines of trading plans to illustrate their\nbasic structure and provide starting points for developing your own.Reading someone’s trading plan is like reading a guide to lovemaking.That manual may open your eyes to a few new positions, but ulti-mately you’ll have to do what suits your temperament and environ-ment to enjoy the results.258 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nTrading Plan A Trader A has $50,000 in his account and is inter-\nested in the stock mar ket. He has been tracking it for a while and has\nobserved that large-capitalization stocks (Dow-type stocks) tend tomove in steady trends but swing above and below their central ten-dencies several times a year.\nA trading plan takes a concept of market behavior—that prices oscil-\nlate above and below their average value—and translates it into a planof action. It identifies the trend and the deviations, selects the tools forcatching them, and includes money management rules, profit targets,and stops.\nRESEARCH\n1.Download four years’ worth of data for 30 stocks in the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average.\n2.Use weekly charts with a 26-week EMA to identify their long-term\ntrends.\nA serious trader will test other approaches such as a longer or a\nshorter EMA, different EMAs for different stocks, or another trend-\nfollowing tool, such as a least regression trendline. Finding the besttools for tracking the average consensus of value in your marketforces you to do a lot of research before putting on the first trade.\n3.Determine the average deviation from value for each stock you plan\nto trade.\nMeasure how high a stock rises above or falls below its weekly\nEMA before swinging back. Channels can help, or you can put thenumbers into a spreadsheet. Find out how far from the EMA thereversals occur, both in terms of price and percentages, as well asthe average duration of those deviations.\nWEEKLY ACTIONS\nReview the weekly charts of all stocks you follow. Mark those that havedeviated from their central tendencies by more than 75% of their aver-age deviation and place them on your daily monitoring list.\nDAILYACTIONS\nTo streamline our discussion, we will consider only buying even thougha complete trading plan is also likely to spell out steps for shorting.TRADING FOR A LIVING 259\n1.Apply a 22-day EMA to stocks on your daily monitoring list to define\ntheir short-term trends. Research whether a longer or a shorter EMAwould do a better job. When a stock is deviating on the weekly chartbut its daily EMA stops moving and turns flat, it becomes a buycandidate.\nHere is another research idea: Is buying more profitable when the\nbroad market rises? How will you define the trend of the broad mar-ket? The EMA of an index, such as the S&P or NASDAQ, or an indi-cator, such as a new-high–new-low Index*? If your stocks march totheir own drummer, then ignore the broad market; otherwise, you\nmay buy more when the broad market rises and less when it falls.\n2.When the weekly chart shows a downside deviation, buy the first\nuptick of the daily EMA. Research types of entries—below the EMA,in its vicinity, at the market, or on a breakout above the previousday’s high.\n3.Place a stop using the SafeZone indicator on the daily chart and set\na profit target at the weekly EMA. Recalculate your orders daily.\nCalculate your dollar risk per share and decide how many shares to\nbuy while observing the 2% Rule. A trader with $50,000 in his accountmay not risk more than $1,000 per trade, including slippage and com-missions. Do not enter a trade if 6% of your account is already exposedto risk in other trades.\nThis plan includes several inviolate rules: buy only when prices are\nbelow the weekly EMA; buy only when the daily EMA is rising; do yourhomework, recalculate your stops daily, and never risk more than 2%of your account equity; do not expose more than 6% of your accountto risk. This plan also makes you exercise your judgment about exactlywhere to enter, where to set profit targets, and what size to trade (as260 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\n*This simple indicator, which can easily be calculated for any exchange, is the best\ngauge of the power of bulls and bears in the stock market. New highs are the stocksthat are making a new high for the year—the leaders in strength. New lows are the\nstocks that are making a new low for the year—the leaders in weakness. If you com-pare their number each day, you will see whether the upside or the downside leader-\nship is stronger. This indicator shows you what the leaders are doing, and you canusually expect the crowds to follow the leaders. I have described this indicator atlength in Trading for a Living .\nlong as you follow the 2% and the 6% Rules). It goes without saying\nthat you have to back up your written plan by keeping good records.\nYour plan is likely to grow more elaborate with the passage of time.\nThe market will throw several curves at you, which will lead you toadjust your plan and make it longer. The plan above ties Triple Screenanalysis (multiple timeframes and indicators) with money management,entries, and exits.\nTrading Plan B Trader B has $30,000 of risk capital and wants to\ntrade futures. He has noticed that those markets tend to spend a lot oftime in flat trading ranges, punctuated by relatively brief but fast trends.He wants to take advantage of those short-term impulse moves.\nR\nESEARCH\nThis trader has relatively little money, but doesn’t want to trade mini-\ncontracts. Therefore, he should focus on inexpensive markets whosenormal levels of noise will not overwhelm his money managementrules.\nFor example, a 1-point change in the S&P 500 translates into $250\nin the S&P futures. A normal 5-point move on an ordinary day willlead to a $1,250 change in equity, exposing a trader with a $30,000account to a 4% loss. The 2% Rule puts many volatile and expensivemarkets off limits for small accounts. Coffee, soybeans, currencies,and many others have to be left alone until your account grows muchlarger.\n1.Download two years’ history in corn, sugar, and copper. Corn is\nthe least volatile of grains, and sugar is the least volatile tropical. Bothare very liquid, permitting easy entries and exits, unlike other inex-pensive markets, such as orange juice, whose thin volume exposestraders to bad slippage. Copper is liquid and tends to be relativelyquiet, except during economic booms. E-minis, electronically tradedindex futures, are good for futures traders interested in the stockmarket. Download two data series for each contract: at least twoyears of continuous data for weekly charts and six months of thefront month data for daily charts.\n2.Test several EMAs to determine which does the best job of tracking\ntrends on the weekly charts. Do a similar job with the daily charts.Find the best channels for each market, especially for the past threeTRADING FOR A LIVING 261\nmonths on the daily charts. Those channels must contain 90 to 95\npercent of recent market action. The past three months are the mostrelevant, but it is a good idea to go back two years in your channelresearch to prepare yourself for their dramatic expansions and con-tractions. Many traders lose their bearings when markets change. Ifyou know your history, you’ll feel less surprised.\nW\nEEKLY ACTIONS\nReview the weekly charts of your markets and determine their trends.\nWhen the weekly trend is up, proceed to the daily charts and look forbuying opportunities. When the weekly is down, look for shortingopportunities. If the weekly trend is unclear, either leave that marketalone or go directly to the daily charts.\nYou can define weekly trends by using the slope of an EMA, or you\ncan be more inventive, especially if you track just a few markets. Forexample, you can use both the EMA and the MACD-Histogram to iden-tify trends. When both indicators move in the same direction, they sig-nal extra strong moves.\nD\nAILYACTIONS\nAgain, to streamline our discussion, we will only discuss buying, but\nthe same logic applies to shorting. Every futures trader must be com-fortable with shorting. These markets have no uptick rule, and the num-ber of short positions always equals that of longs.\n1.Apply the Impulse System. When both the EMA and MACD-Histogram\nrise, they give a strong buy signal.\n2.Go long the following day, but do not buy above the upper chan-\nnel line.\nThis aggressive entry aims to capture high-speed impulse moves.\nYou will have to research and test this idea in the market you wantto trade at the moment. Avoid the trap of mechanical systems thatpeople trade long after the markets have changed.\nBefore you enter a trade, calculate where to put your stop. See\nwhat percentage of capital you will risk in that trade. Decidewhether your money management rules allow you to take it. Doesthe 6% Rule allow you to trade? For example, if you’ve lost 3.5%of your account this month and have an open trade with 2% of262 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nequity at risk, no new trade may be opened because it would risk\nmore than 6% of your equity.\n3.Set a stop using the SafeZone indicator on the daily chart. \nIf your stop placement allows you to take the trade, place the buy\norder. As soon as you have your confirmation, place your stop. Recal-culate your stop and place a new one each day. Don’t allow a sud-den violent move to blow through a mental stop while you’re notwatching.\nTake your profit before the close of the day during which the\ndaily screen goes off its buy signal. This means you have to calcu-late your formula a few minutes before the close. The upper chan-nel line on the daily chart is too modest a target when you arefishing for an impulse move. Stay with the trade as long as the buysignal stays in force. Be sure to test this approach.\nThis plan combines inviolate rules with recommendations that\nencourage you to use your judgment. Using multiple timeframes, fol-lowing money management rules, using stops, and scrupulously keep-ing records are non-negotiable. Choosing the markets, the entry points,and the profit targets and deciding what size to trade—these all dependon your judgment.\nExpect to modify your plan as you continue to research the markets\nand as your expertise grows. Remember to write down any changes,and record your development as a trader. Be sure to add short sellingto your plan because this is an integral part of trading futures.\nAt some point you may want to design a flowchart of your decision-\nmaking process, along these lines:\nDoes the 6% Rule allow me to trade? \nIf No, stand aside; if Yes:\nIs the weekly chart giving a signal?\nIf No, move to the next market; if Yes:\nIs the daily chart giving me a signal to trade in the same direction?\nIf No, skip that market; if Yes:\nWhere will I put my profit target and stop; is the risk-reward ratio\nworth trading?\nIf No, skip that trade, if Yes:TRADING FOR A LIVING 263\nWhat size does the 2% Rule allow me to trade and how much will \nI trade?\nOne could draw an extensive flowchart for every trade, but the key\npoint is to observe several inviolate rules, mostly having to do withmoney management and multiple timeframes. As long as you observethose rules, you have a wide choice of analytic and trading techniques.Just be sure to keep good records and continue to learn from yourexperience if you want to trade like a pro.\nBEGINNER , SEMIPRO , PRO\nTraders’ questions reveal their stages of development. Beginners alwaysask about trading methods—what indicators to use, what systems tochoose. They want to know the right Stochastic parameters and thebest length of a moving average. Most newbies are so excited aboutprofits and so clueless about risk that no fancy tools can save themfrom disasters.\nThose who survive the stage of original innocence move on, thanks\nto a combination of luck, work, or an inborn sense of caution. Theylearn to select trades and find where to buy and sell. They start askingwhy their profits are so inconsistent, if they know so much. How cometheir account is up 20% one month and down 25% the next? How comethey can make money but not grow equity?\nTraders at the second stage often grab a profit and spend it before\nthat money evaporates. They feel insecure about their ability tomake money. I remember ages ago taking a penny profit from Swissfranc futures and rushing to a jewelry store to buy my then-wife anecklace. Another time, I used a little less than a cent profit to buymy daughter an expensive Abyssinian cat. Those cats have longlives and hers, named Swissie, used to remind me of my old impul-\nsive trading days.\nTraders who get stuck at that level keep bouncing up and down like\na flower in an ice hole. To move to the next stage, a trader must over-come the biggest obstacle to winning—the person he sees in the mirror.He must recognize his role in putting on impulsive trades, undisci-plined trades, trades without stops. No matter how clever his methods,he is not a winner until his mind is in the right place. His personality,with all its quirks, influences results more than any computer. Tradersat that stage ask: “Do I have to put in stops or can I use mental stops?”264 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\n“Why am I afraid to pull the trigger?” “How come the trades I don’t take\nwork out better than those I take?”\nA trader who survives, succeeds, and moves up to the third stage\nfeels relaxed and calm. When he asks questions, he is interested inmoney management. His trading system is in place, his discipline isgood, and he puts a lot of time into thinking how to allocate his trad-ing capital and reduce risk.\nThese three stages form a pyramid, a structure with a broad base\nand a narrow top. The journey has a high attrition rate. I wrote this\nbook to help make your passage a little smoother, faster, less painful,and more profitable.\nWhat are the reasonable profit targets for different stages? The\nnumbers I’ll give you may surprise you as low. You want to makemore money, and you should feel free to reach higher and do betterif you can. These guideposts should help you see whether you’remeeting the minimum requirements. They help you recognize whenyou are in trouble so that you can stop, think, and adjust yourmethods. If you trade for a bank and keep missing profit targets,your manager will pull your trading privileges. A private trader hasno manager and is in charge of his own discipline. If this bookhelps you stop, think, regroup, and move higher, I have not wasted\nmy time writing.\n1. B\nEGINNER\nA.The minimal acceptable performance level for a beginner is a\nloss of 10% of trading capital in a year. Traders are shocked\nwhen I give them this number. They forget that most begin-ners blow themselves out fast. Many lose 10% in a month ifnot in a week. If you can survive for a year, learn about trad-ing, and lose less than 10%, your education is cheap and youare way ahead of the crowd.\nB.The goal of a beginner is to cover trading expenses and gener-\nate annual return on his account equal to one and a halftimes the current rate on T-Bills or a comparable risklessinstrument. You have to charge the cost of software, data,\nclasses, and books, including the one you’re reading, againstyour trading account. Beginners often throw money at guruswho promise the keys to the kingdom. Charging your trading-related expenses against your account introduces a usefulTRADING FOR A LIVING 265\nreality check. If you can cover them and then beat the Treasury\nbills, you’ re no longer a beginner!\n2. I NTERMEDIATE (SERIOUS AMATEUR OR SEMIPROFESSIONAL )\nA.The minimum acceptable performance level for a serious\namateur is return on equity twice the current rate on T-Bills.Your improvement is evolutionary, not revolutionary. Cut someof your losses a little faster, grab some of your profits a littlesooner, learn a few more tricks of the trade. Once you’re cov-ering your trading expenses and making double what youcould get from riskless paper, you’re miles ahead of the effi-cient market theorists.\nB.The goal of a serious amateur or a semiprofessional is to gen-\nerate a 20% annual return on equity. At this stage, the size of\nyour trading capital becomes an important factor. If you aretrading a million dollars, you may be able to start living offyour profits. But what if you trade a relatively small account,say $50,000? You know you can trade, but 20% of $50,000 isnot enough for a living. Most undercapitalized traders destroythemselves by overtrading, trying to squeeze unrealistic returnsfrom their tiny accounts. Take crazy risks, and you’ll have crazyresults—both on the way up and on the way down. Better stickto your trading system and leverage your skills by trading otherpeople’s money (see “Going Pro” on the next page).\n3. E\nXPERT\nA.The minimal performance targets are more flexible for ex-\nperts. Their returns are steadier, but not necessarily higher thanthose of serious amateurs. You have to continue outperform-ing T-Bills—to fall behind them would be ridiculous. An expert\nmay grab a 100% return in a good year, but trading a serious\namount of money year after year, just staying north of 20% isa very good performance. Certified geniuses such as George\nSoros maintain a lifetime average of nearly 30% per year.\nB.The goal of an expert trader is to put enough money into riskless\ninvestments to be able to maintain his current standard of livingforever, even if he stops trading. Trading at this stage becomes a\ngame that you continue to play for your own enjoyment. Soroscertainly doesn’t need any more money for personal expenses266 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nbut trades because he enjoys spending fortunes on political and\ncharitable causes. Curiously enough, when you no longer haveto stretch for the money, it starts flowing in faster than ever.\nGOING PRO\nA beginner is better off starting with a relatively small account. Some-one who has moved up to a solid semiprofessional level needs to startpushing up his account size to increase profits. An expert with a largeaccount has to be cautious not to impact thin markets with his trades.He has to watch out for a fall in performance, a frequent side effect ofgreater size.\nThe minimum size for a trading account is about $20,000 at this\ntime. Once you’ve moved up to the level of a serious amateur or asemiprofessional trader, $80,000 will give you more freedom todiversify. Once you get your account up to $250,000, you may startthinking of moving up to professional trading. These are absoluteminimums, and if you can increase them, your life will be easier.Starting with $50,000, having $120,000 at a semiprofessional level, andmoving up to professional trading at $500,000 will improve yourchances of success.\nWhat if you do not have that much? Trading on a shoestring raises the\npressure to a deadly level. A person with a tiny account cannot applythe essential 2% Rule. If he has only $5,000, his permitted risk is only$100 per trade, which guarantees that he will be stopped out by marketnoise. A desperate beginner swallows hard and puts on a trade withouta stop. Most likely, he’ll lose, but what if he wins, ends up with $7,000,then puts on another trade and goes up to $10,000? If he is smart, he willsharply reduce his trading size and start using the 2% Rule now. He wasvery lucky and should put his winnings into a sensible trading program.Most people become intoxicated by success and cannot stop. A begin-ner who has doubled his $5,000 stake usually feels that the game is easyand he’s a genius. He feels he can walk on water, but soon drowns.\nYou might be able to start by getting a trading job, but corporate\nWall Street will not hire someone over 25 for a paying job as a tradertrainee. A more realistic option is to sharply cut expenses, get a moon-lighting job, and save money as fast as you can, while paper tradingthe markets. This calls for discipline, and some of the best traders have\nstarted this way. The third option is to trade other people’s money.TRADING FOR A LIVING 267\nTrading your own capital reduces the level of stress. Having to\nraise money increases tension and interferes with trading. Taking aloan is not a sensible way to raise funds because the interest raises aninsurmountable barrier to success. Borrowing money from family andfriends has the added kicker of having to justify their trust and trying toshow off.\nScared money is losing money. If you have to worry about paying it\nback, you cannot concentrate on trading. Companies that hire execu-tives usually run credit checks on their candidates. A high level of debtkills a candidacy because a person who is worried about money can-not properly concentrate on his job. I know a chronic loser whoreceived a quarter million from his mom as a wedding gift. She toldhim to buy an exchange seat as an investment, but he resented hisfinancial dependency on the strong-willed lady and decided to showhow good he really was. He took a loan against the seat and went totrade on the floor. His scheme had a predictable ending, and to thisday his family talks of “the missing seat.”\nYou are better off learning to trade with your own money. The time\nto use other people’s money comes when you know what you aredoing and want to leverage your skills. There are huge pools of capi-tal sloshing through the financial system, looking for competent moneymanagers. Show a good track record going back several years, and youwill have all the money you care to manage.\nI have a friend who earned an engineering degree but went to work\nas a floor clerk on a futures exchange. He spent several years learningto trade, saved $50,000, and then quit his job to trade full-time. Hemoonlighted by writing a book and teaching a few classes but contin-ued to struggle despite his steady 50% annual returns. His profit wasabout $25,000 a year, but he had to pay rent, eat, and occasionally buya new tennis racket and a pair of shoes. After a few years of this hehad a bad year and broke even. That’s when he had to eat his seedgrain—dip into his trading capital for living expenses. Then he con-nected with a big money management firm.\nThe firm checked his track record and staked him out with an addi-\ntional $50,000. He was to trade through that firm, at low commissions,and keep 20% of any profits on managed money. He kept delivering,and they kept giving him more money to manage. In a few years hewas up to $11 million but then had another bad year, returning only18% profit. In the old days he would be dipping into his capital, but268 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nnow the math was different. Eighteen percent profit on $11 million\ncame to almost $2 million, and his 20% share was $400,000. That’s howmuch he earned in a bad year. He now has over $100 million undermanagement. His performance as a trader has not changed much, butthe size of his rewards went through the roof.\nYou can start trading other people’s money informally, without a\nlicense, although you will have to register once the funds under man-agement exceed a certain limit. The rules are different for stocks andfutures because they have different regulators.\nYou can begin by asking people to give you the power of attorney\nover their accounts, allowing you to trade but not to withdraw themoney. Once you become registered, it is not a good idea to haveindividual managed accounts because their owners receive confirma-tion slips for each trade and pepper you with questions. It is better tohave all your accounts in a pool whose members receive a single state-ment at the end of the month telling them how much that pool is worthand what their share is.\nFutures money managers are regulated by the National Futures\nAssociation (NFA). To become a Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA),you must pass an exam known as Series 3, unless you are a floortrader. Stock market money managers are regulated by the Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC). Their exam, called Series 7, is muchharder and many people take months to prepare for it.\nThe more free-market NFA allows its members to charge perform-\nance fees, taking a share of profits, much as US lawyers work on con-tingency fees. It is not uncommon for a manager to take 20% of profits,but that is not how most of them make their money. Many charge 1%or 2% of assets as a management fee. If you collect 1% on $50 million,you are taking in half a million dollars a year just for being a nice guy.Any performance fees come on top of that as pure gravy.\nThe more blue-blood SEC does not allow performance fees, forcing\nits registrants to be satisfied with a small percentage of assets. Since theassets in the stock market are much greater than in the futures market,those fees are nothing to sneeze at. For all the mutual fund advertisinghoopla, those fees are a key deciding factor in funds’ long-term perfor-mance. The Vanguard Fund, which has always made low fees its key sell-ing point, keeps outperforming most hot-shot managers in the long run.\nStock market money managers have found a way to run around the\nSEC regulation against performance fees. They set up vehicles knownTRADING FOR A LIVING 269\nas hedge funds. Only so-called qualified investors who pass income\nand assets tests are allowed to invest in them. Hedge fund managerstypically put their own money into the funds and receive performancefees comparable to those in futures markets. A hedge fund manager istrading his own money along with that of his clients, which is proba-bly why hedge funds as a group outperform mutual funds. Trackinghedge fund managers and shifting funds between them offers an alter-native to tracking the markets for wealthy investors. If you go thisroute, make sure you find out what percentage of their own assets theyhave in their funds.\nSuccessful money managers go through three stages of develop-\nment. Many begin by informally managing a few modest accounts.Then they become registered and the funds under management rise tomillions of dollars. Those who accumulate a five-year track record ofsteady gains and low drawdowns can go after the key prize—pensionfunds and endowment money. Those who get to manage these assetsare the true elite of professional money managers.270 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nCHAPTER TEN\nCOME INTO \nMY TRADING ROOM\nGood trades begin and end with money management. The 6% Rule\ntells you whether you may put on a trade in the first place. Then,\nbefore you place an order, the 2% Rule tells you the maximum sizeallowed for that trade, based on the distance from your entry to the stop.Sandwiched between those rules is market analysis. Here, in this chapter,I want to illustrate the analytic process for you.\nShocking but true, most people who write books on trading do not\ntrade. In putting together their books, they rely on the power of well-chosen hypothetical examples. The only people obligated to disclose theirtrack records are money managers. I trade my own money and feel noneed to lay my full accounting open to curiosity seekers. Still, you trustedme enough to buy this book. Since all trust is mutual, I want to recipro-cate by showing you some of my trades.\nHere are a few trades I executed in recent months. It is important that\nall of them have already been closed out. One of the worst things a tradercan do is reveal his open trades, putting his ego on the line and gummingup the decision-making process. Completed trades are history, from whichwe may learn.\nThese charts show how one trader makes his buy and sell decisions. Mine\nare based primarily on Triple Screen trading system—making strategic deci-sions in the longer timeframe and tactical decisions in the shorter timeframe.\nWhenever I put on a trade, I print out its charts and mark key signals\nthat prompted me to act. Whenever I close a trade, I print out its chartsagain and mark up those signals that prompted me to exit. I may write afew lines on how I first became aware of a potential trade, how I feltentering and exiting, and so on. I try not to write a dissertation on everytrade, and record only the key factors, aiming for speed and brevity.\n271\nMy journal, a hard-cover spiral-bound album, sits on a bookshelf in my\ntrading room. I sometimes come into that room in the evening, sprawl inan armchair, and review my trades, one after another. Some pages arepleasant, others painful, but all are educational.\nAs you go looking for trades, please do not feel as if you have to find\nthe same patterns as shown here. This is just a brief excerpt from oneman’s diary—a few of the trades made in recent months. Also, trading isintensely personal, with different people reacting to different aspects ofthe game. There are many ways to make money in the markets and evenmore ways to lose it. My main purpose in showing you a few pages frommy diary is to prompt you to begin documenting your trades in order tolearn from your own experience.272 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nCOME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 273\nEXCERPTS FROM THE DIARY\nCharts in my trading diary are printed in color and marked up by hand.\nComments, written on margins, are telegraphic and abbreviated. In preparingthis manuscript for publication, I had to print those charts in black and whiterather than color, while slightly expanding my comments to make them eas-ier to understand.\nShowing strangers your trading diary feels almost like inviting them\ninto the bedroom during an intimate moment. As we grow older, we careless and less about what others think of us; I do not believe I could haveshown you my diary just a few years ago.\nThe key question is, What are you going to do with it? Will you casu-\nally flip through the pages? Will you go through them slowly, evaluatingeach trading signal? Will you feel overwhelmed? Will you feel critical,especially of trades with less than perfect scores? Before I turn my recordsof six recent trades over to you, I have just one question. Will you bekeeping your own diary? If my example has inspired you, I will haveachieved my goal.\n274 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nTrade 1—Long CSCO\nThe stock market has been falling for a year, accelerating in recent\nmonths. In a Traders’ Camp a month prior to this trade I asked a guestinstructor, a famous expert, what companies will be left standing at the\nbottom of a severe economic, as well as financial, decline, that is, what\nstocks to buy amid the ruins. His answer—BGEN, CSCO, and IBM. Iincluded all three in my weekly scan of the market.\nFigure 10.1 Weekly EntryTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nCOME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 275\nABC\nFigure 10.2 Daily Entry 1\nABC\nFigure 10.3 Daily Entry 2\nENTRY\nW eekly: CSCO has lost over 85% of its value, but this company is not\ngoing to disappear like some silly dot-com. Weekly trading ranges havebecome narrow; the bars near the right edge are only a couple of dol-lars wide, compared with $10 bars a year ago. This is a sign that spec-ulative excesses have been squeezed out. Weekly MACD-Histogramhas been rising for the past six weeks at the right edge—bullish. Weekly\nprice is as far below its EMA as it was above it at the top in 2000; the“rubber band” that connects price to the EMA is overextended, ready tosnap back.\nDaily: Massive bullish divergence between price and MACD-Histogram.\nSee how strong bears were at bottom A, weaker at bottom B, and now,at C, with prices much lower, bears hardly have any power. Moreover,there is a rarely seen bullish divergence B-C between price and MACD-Lines. Triple bullish divergence A-B-C between two-day Force Indexand price shows that each recent attempt to drive prices lower wasweaker than before. This divergence is shouting to buy now because itreveals that bears are out of steam and bulls are about to seize control.\nAction: Long on 4/9/2001 at 13.91, with a stop at 13.18, below the latest\nlow.276 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nCOME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 277\nAB\nFigure 10.4 Exit\nEXIT\nDaily: Prices snapped back slightly above their EMA, working off the over-\nsold condition, and appear to have stalled.

If you figure out what the leaders are doing, you can start lookingfor similar patterns in the laggards. A friend drew my attention to GXwhen she called to ask my opinion on a handful of stocks that she liked.Its patterns looked remarkably similar to CSCO, which was already run-ning in my favor.\nABC\nFigure 10.5 Weekly Entry\nCOME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 279\nAC\nAB\nFigure 10.7 Daily Entry 2\nAB\nFigure 10.6 Daily Entry 1\n280 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nENTRY\nW eekly: GX has lost over 80% of its value. Prices are as deep below their\nweekly EMA as they have ever been, just above the $10 psychologicalsupport level. Both MACD-Histogram and MACD-Lines are tracing mas-sive bullish divergences (A-B-C and B-C, respectively).\nDaily: Bullish divergence between MACD-Histogram and price A-B shows\nthat bears are becoming weaker, prices are falling out of inertia, and nogreat selling pressure exists. Seven trading days ago there was a falsebreakout below 10, and the rightmost bar is declining to retest thatlevel. The bottom of the previous week’s break provides a logical stop-loss point. The two-day Force Index is tracing a triple bullish diver-gence A-B-C, showing that bears have no force—it is a screaming buy.Expect prices to snap above their EMA.\nAction: Long on 4/16/2001 at 10.05, with a stop at 8.76, below the latest\nlow.\nCOME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 281\nA\nB\nFigure 10.8 Exit\nEXIT\nDaily: The rally is stalling, as prices have snapped back slightly above\ntheir EMA.

Once I presented my methods, we spent the bulk of the time apply-ing them to stocks chosen by campers. Out of dozens of stocks we analyzedthat weekend, none looked more appealing than PG. On Monday mor ning\nI went on-line and placed a buy order.\nFigure 10.9\nCOME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 283\nAB\nFigure 10.10\nBCD\nA\nFigure 10.11\nENTRY\nW eekly: Prices declining into support, weekly MACD-Histogram on the\nverge of completing a bullish divergence, while the broad market israllying.\nDaily: Bullish divergence of MACD-Histogram A-B with an extremely shal-\nlow second bottom B shows that bears are completely out of steam.The two-day Force Index shows both a longer-term bullish divergenceA-B-C-D since February and a short-term C-D at the right edge, givingthe final command to pull the trigger.

A deep bottom of the two-day Force Index near the rightedge reflects massive liquidation, which appears to be over, as prices ral-lied above support.

The work was hard, but I enjoyed the journey. Reading musthave been hard work for you, especially if you studied this book and didnot just skim. I wrote on several levels, and it will probably take you morethan one reading to grasp all its ideas and concepts. Expect to return andreview sections of this book in the months and years ahead, as your ex-pertise grows and new questions emerge.\nWe spent a lot of time together, but now our paths diverge.I’ve accomplished what I wanted, summarized my ideas on trading.\nLiberated from the word processor, I am off to pursue my passions, espe-cially trading and travel. I will spend more time in front of the screen,travel to faraway places, and if they have good Internet connections, I’lltrade from there, combining my interests.\nWhat will you do?You had your lessons in psychology, technical analysis, money man-\nagement, and record keeping. If you are serious about success, start apply-ing what you’ve learned. You have your work cut out for you.\nYour first task is to set up a record-keeping system. Keeping records is\nlike looking in a mirror while shaving with a very sharp blade. You’re saferif you look. Hammering on this topic reminds me how I once sent apatient to AA who told me that those meetings ruined him as an alcoholic.Getting drunk could never be fun again. Keeping records will do the samefor you—it will immunize you against impulsive gambling.\nYour next step is to set up a money management plan. Follow that by\nwriting down your trading plan, a decision-making tree. Once you do that,you’ll be moving in the direction opposite to the majority of the tradingpublic. Test everything you read in this or any other book. Only testingcan make any method your own.\nThose who concentrate on the rewards, which are considerable, often\npush themselves too hard. It is better to trade small in order to be morerelaxed and enjoy the learning process. Then you will emerge not onlyricher, but also more alert, aware, free, and at peace with yourself.\nI have traveled this road, made my choices, and battled my demons,\ngrowing from a wide-eyed beginner into someone who knows what he isdoing. The journey had many rough stretches, but both the trip and therewards are worth it.298 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nClosing this book does not mean having to say good-bye. If I continue\nto run my Traders’ Camps, you may come to spend a week during whichwe’ll work on trading together. All new ideas in this book have first beenpresented to my campers, to whom my work is dedicated.\nIn writing this book I gave you my best and did not hold anything back.\nI hope you will give all of yourself to becoming a good trader. I nowreturn to my trading room and wish you success in yours.\nDr. Alexander Elder\nNew YorkFebruary 2002COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 299\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWriting this page is like having a dessert—after working on this\nbook for more than three years, I get a chance to thank those\nwho helped me along the way.\nThanks, first of all, to my campers, the people to whom this book is\ndedicated. For the past several years I have been running Traders’Camps, becoming friends with some of the sharpest, most inquisitivepeople in the markets. Their questions forced me to dig deeper andarticulate my ideas more clearly. To this day, one of the highlights ofeach month is a meeting of campers in my apartment in Manhattan.\nI want to thank my staff, especially my manager, Inna Feldman. I\ntrust her to take good care of my clients while I am traveling or trad-ing overseas.\nFred Schutzman, an old and loyal friend, found time in his busy\nschedule to read the entire manuscript, and his eagle eye caught sev-eral oversights. Fred did a similar review of my previous book, Trading\nfor a Living. At its publication party I introduced him to the woman\nwho was my assistant manager. They started dating, married, and lastyear had their third child. Fred has a beautiful family, an unexpectedbonus for his hard work.\nMy best friend, Lou Taylor, to whom Trading for a Living was ded-\nicated, died more than a year before the current book was completed.His sage advice was priceless and his absence at the next book partywill feel like a huge void.\nMy older daughter Miriam, a journalist in Paris, helped edit this man-\nuscript. It seems like just a few years ago I was correcting her home-work, and now she takes a red pen to my pages. Her English and herstyle are impeccable; it looks like that homework paid off. My second\n301\ndaughter, Nika, an art historian in New York, another person with a\nrazor-sharp sense of taste, developed the design for the jacket of thebook. She also selected the fonts and made other suggestions toimprove the look and feel of the book. Both girls, as well as my young-est child Danny, provided many cheerful distractions from business. Ioften took them on trips, and since they like to sleep late, I had the timeto work on this book in the cafes of Venice, Fiji, New Zealand, andother locales, before a day of skiing or museum hopping.\nMy former manager, Carol Keegan Kayne, who edited all of my pre-\nvious books, reviewed page proofs of this one. She convinced me onceand for all that no book of mine is finished until she signs off on it.\nMy old friend Ted Bonanno insulated me from the most stressful part\nof writing a book—negotiating a publishing contract. Ted is an Olympicrowing coach (not long ago he went to the Sydney Olympics and Idid not go near the gym for three blessed weeks). We work outtogether, and it was fun discussing business with Ted while running orbetween rounds of weight lifting.\nLast but not least, I want to thank many friends around the world\nin whose beach, mountain, or city houses I sometimes stayed whilewriting this book. Since many of them are traders, I hope they bene-fited from the insights I shared with them as much as I enjoyed theirhospitality.\nDr. Alexander Elder\nNew YorkFebruary 2002302 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSOURCES\nAchelis, Steven.

For years I have been \nreading books and exploring web sites that are dedicated to swing trading.  Yet, I \ncould not find any simple de scription of how to enter and exit a trade.  So I \ndeveloped some basic rules that have  been published on my web site \nwww.mrswing.com .  I call these rules The Master Plan .  Over the years, thousands \nof investors have used my Master Plan to swing trade .  It is my firm belief that a \nswing trader  must trade with discipline.  While it is important to keep things \nsimple, the rules of the Master Plan  might seem a little intimidating.  The main \nreason I wrote this book was to make swing trading more accessible to the \nbeginner.  These rational behind swing trading and th e entry and exit rules are \npresented very clearly – both the beginner and the experienced swing trader will now \nhave a simple guide to follow. \nTo quote Albert Einstein:  \"Things should be made as simple as possible, but not \nany simpler\".  This is the principle I followed while writing this book. \n \nq  Why does swing trading work? \nBecause you are trading in the direction of the trend.  You \nwait for a pullback before entering the trade, and you enter \nonly if the stock shows a sign that it’s price will continue in \nthe direction of the trend. \n \nThe main objective of a swing trader  is to profit from swings  in price \nmovement over the course of several days.  While we might trade every day, we are \nnot day traders.  As swing traders , we have the patience to wait until our profit \ngoals have been reached.  Fortunately, the wait is not too long.  A typical trade is only in play from a few days to a few weeks.  When a trade is closed, the funds go \ninto the next trade. \nMoney management is very important in swing trading.  I divide my trading \ncapital by 15.  This is the amount that I put into each trade.  As the total account \ngrows, the amount of each trade grows.  If you can handle a larger number of\nPage 8 trades, you might increase the number of trad es that are active to 20.  Of course \nyou can also start with 2 or 3 trades at a time. \nEach day I identify 20 to 25 candidates for swing trading.  If I have 10 trades \nactive and enough addi tional investment capital for 5 more trades, I pick the best 10 \nfrom my list of 25, and place the orders.  Only some of orders will get filled.  I don’t worry about running out of money – if there is  no cash left in the account, additional \norders will simply not get filled.  (Make sure that your own account works this way, otherwise, your brokerage firm might fill the order and expect additional funds within the next few days.) \nYou must make a personal de cision as to whether you want to trade on margin \nor not.  If you are more conservative, you will only trade with the cash that you have on hand.  As I discuss later in the book, margin is necessary for selling stocks \nshort , so it is important to ha ve your account approved for margin trading, even if \nyou don’t plan to trade on margin. \nThe stocks I identify as good swing trading  opportunities are made available \neach day through my MasterSwings service.  Once a week, my picks are made \navailable on my website – www.mrswing.com\n – or by e-mail, through my free \nMrSwing Lite  service. \nSwing trading should be both profitable and fun.  Through the guidelines \noutlined in this book, you can achiev e both of these simple objectives.\nPage 9 2 About the book \n2.1 Who should read this book \n• If you (like many investors) are disenchanted with buy-and-hold investing, \nswing trading may be right for you.  Even if you invested in great companies, it is likely that the value of your investments has diminished substantially \nover the past few years. \n• If you’re not a stock market expert, yet would still like to make money in the \nstock market. \n• Day trading requires both stock market expertise and the ability to constantly \nwatch the market.  If day trading  is not for you, swing trading  might \nsatisfy your needs. \n• If you are disciplined and patient – the swing trading methodology outlined in \nthis book will teach you how to trade successfully with very little risk.  \nHowever, you must carefully follow the Master Plan,  and you must be \npatient – profits come slowly, but surely.  The total value of your investment \naccount will go up.  This is in sharp contrast to the buy-and-hold strategy, \nwhere losing money is more commo n than we would like to admit. \n \nSwing trading  allows you to accumulate small gains weekly, ultimately making \nmoney through a disciplined, low-risk trading approach.  While swing trading is not for everyone, this book will help you determine if swing trading is right for you.  It \nprovides a treasure map to the pot of gold which is found at the end of the rainbow. \n2.2 How to get started swing trading \n• Read this book \n• Open an account with an online discount broker (recommendations are \nprovided) \n• Select a method for identifying swing trading opportunities \n− subscribe to a service like MasterSwings  and get several swing trading \nsuggestions each day \n− use MrSwing Lite  and get free swing tradin g suggestions each week\nPage 10 − use SwingTracker  and identify swing tradin g opportunities yourself, \nwhenever you’d like \n− Use the Master Plan  to enter and exit your trades \n− Be disciplined and have patience \n2.3 What will this book teach you \n• the rational behind swing trading \n• how to identify stocks to swing trade \n• when to enter a trade \n• when to exit a trade \n• how to maximize profit s and minimize risk \n• what tools are available to help you se lect stocks and monitor your progress \n• what books to read to learn more about swing trading \nThe best part of my swing trading method is that you do not have to watch your \npositions during the day.  Simply enter an order to bu y or sell short, give your \ndiscount broker the buy order and two sell or ders and go back to your daily life. \n2.4 Prefaces \nSuri Duddella, siXer.com  \nTraders and investors study markets throug h price charts.  These powerful visual \ntools offer a common language for all stoc ks, options, and indices.  The theory \nbehind this is called Technical Analysis .  Technical Analysis  begins with a simple \nobservation that all market activity is reflected in the activity of price and volume over time.  These three pieces of informatio n create a profound vi sual representation \nwhen properly presented in a chart. \nPrices rise and fall, with rising prices being stimulated by greed and falling prices by \nthe awakening of fear.  This emotional war between greed and fear generates a \nswinging price movement that pr ovides a perfect opportunity for swing trading .  \nSwing Traders  capitalize on the emotions of others while they carefully control their \nown emotions and systematically enter and exit trades.  Swing Traders recognize the \nlevels of support and resistance.  They understand the concepts of momentum and \nvolatility and can identify a trading range or channel.\nPage 11 Equity trading provides a natural arena for Swing Traders .  As price seeks an \nequilibrium state, Swing Traders seek to exploit direct price thrusts as they enter positions at support and resi stance.  By examining chart pattern characteristics they \nmake money in both trending and range bo und markets.  Swing Trading is a classic \nstrategy that involves holding stocks for a short period of time, typically between a \nfew days to a few weeks.  Unlike day tradin g, Swing Trading is independent of time – \nnevertheless, some Swing Traders will exit a slow-moving position and move onto the next opportunity. \nSwing Trading is very popular among short-te rm and medium-term traders.  It offers \nmany virtues compared to the hyperactivity of  day trading.  With recent changes in  \nSEC regulations that affect the way brokerage firms administer margin to 'Day Trading' accounts, many day traders have  moved away from day trading towards a \nswing trading style. \nLarry Swing has developed a wonderful software program called SwingTracker  that \nallows users to scan all listed stocks using his Swing Trade Identifiers to identify \nswing trading opportunities.  The program allows the user to monitor their trades in \nreal-time.  His technica l analysis concepts of EquiVolume  and Force Index  coupled \nwith his Swing Trading tactics are a marv elous contribution to the swing trading \ncommunity. \nLarry Swing has mastered the art of Swing Trading .  His website – \nwww.mrswing.com\n – not only presents the theoretical underpinnings of swing \ntrading, but provides a detailed road map of how to use them.  This book – A \nPractical Guide to Swing Trading – communica tes the essence of his ideas in a simple \nand straightforward way.  It describes the tools necessary to identify swing trading \nopportunities, and the guidelines n eeded to implement his strategy. \nThis book is filled with innovative, important trading techniques.  This book is a great \nasset to both beginner and experienced swing traders. \nSuri Duddella \nPresident & CEO siXer.com, inc.\nPage 12 Dr. Sergey Perminov, OptionSmart.com \nNowadays, when the number of online trader s is growing very fast, the need for a \ngood book is obvious.  Larry’s new book provides a unique combination of \nprofessionalism and simplicity, presented in an easy-to-read style.  This kind of book \nis currently in short supply. \nLarry writes about real trading situatio ns, explaining how to reduce risks and \nenhance returns.  The book contains practical examples and explanations how to handle the various scenarios that might arise.   I feel comfortable saying that this is \nthe best practical manual for swing trading that I have ever read.  \nHis focus on short-term (swing) trading is  very understandable.  In the current, \nturbulent market environment, many people consider “buy-and-hold” investing to be \nan outdated strategy.  However, they  are not sure what else to do.  Swing Trading  \noffers a real opportunity to produce profits while keeping risk under control. \nThe algorithms that Larry uses in SwingTracker  are great at identifying swing \ntrading opportunities – they are extremely valuable to both beginners and \nexperienced swing traders.  \nLarry covers the whole process of swing tr ading, from soup to nuts.  He even \nrecommends brokerage firms that have feat ures which are particularly useful to \nswing traders. \nNot only does this book introduce a set of helpful tools and tips, it describes way of \nthinking about trading and philosophy that a llows the reader to feel confident about \nswing trading which leads to success and profits. \nDr. Sergey Perminov OptionSmart.com Founder & CEO\nPage 13 \n3 Meet Larry \nLarry Swing graduated from the university with a B.A. in Computer \nScience, specializing in artificial intelligence.  He started his career as an Information Technology Researcher in the field of robotics and expert systems.  He later ch anged direction somewhat, moving \ninto the field of computer-driven multimedia.  This background \nformed a foundation from which he  developed his ‘no non sense’ \napproach to swing trading . \nMrSwing runs a free educational website – www.mrswing.com\n – where he provides \nspecific instructions on how to swing trade .  He provides a free newsletter – \nMrSwing Lite – that identifies many swing tradin g opportunities each week.  Larry \nhas developed charting software – SwingTracker  – that comes with a real-time \ndata feed to assist investors that need an inexpensive method to identify swing \ntrading opportunities and monitor their progress. \nwww.mrswing.com  also has a free SwingLab  that lists the criteria he personally \nuses to identify stocks that are good swing trading candidates. \nMrSwing provides the investment community with a wonderful educational resource.  \nOne can learn about the essentials of technical analysis, with instructions on how to \napply these principles to swing trading .  Over the years, Larry has developed a \nfairly large library of books that discuss the principles behind swing trading specifically, and making money in the stock market in general.  These personally recommended books can be purchased at www.mrswing.com\n. \nHundreds of thousand s of investors visit www.mrswing.com  each year.

We also believe that it is also important to keep things simple.  While our goal is to keep things simple, the trading rules might initially seem a bit complex.  However, once you learn the rules and you trade with discipline, you will make \nmoney in the stock market. \nSwing trading allows you to make money when the market is bullish, or bearish, or \njust going sideways.  That is why it has a distinct advantage over other approaches \nto investing.  The goal is to make money, not to rest one’s hopes on the future of a \nstock, a sector, or the economy. \n4.1  What is Swing Trading \nEveryone is familiar with waves.  A wave alternates from positive to negative, then to positive and nega tive, and so on.  Waves are fo und in nature – you see waves \nwhen you throw a rock into a lake.  Sound is transmitted in waves.  And when stock \nprices change, they follow a wave-like pattern.  The wave is rarely as orderly a sine \nwave, but they are waves nevertheless, an d we use these waves in Swing Trading. \n4.2  Let’s Look at an Up Trends \nThe chart below shows the price movement  of Myriad Genetics (MYGN) in an \nuptrend.  Notice that after the price moves up, it takes a rest, or pulls back.  When \nwe swing trade  an uptrend, we buy on the pull-back. \nAn uptrend can be identified by a series of  higher highs and high er lows (the bottom \nof each pull-back). In other words, an uptrend is a series of successive rallies with each rally going higher than the previous one and each pull-back  stopping above the \nprevious one.  \nThe price movement looks more like the zig- zag of a saw blade than a sinusoid, but \nonce an uptrend is established the pa ttern tends to repeat itself.  In swing trading  \nwe capitalize on the predictability of the pattern.  We buy during the pull-back  to \nincrease our chances of making a profit.\nPage 17 \n \nFigure 1 : up trend  \n4.3  Let’s Look at a Down Trend \nThe chart below shows the price movement of Verisign (VRSN) in a downtrend.  \nNotice that after the price moves down, it  takes a rest, or pulls up.  The price \nmovement follows a zig zag pattern. \nA downtrend  can be identified by a series of lower lows and lower highs (the peak \nof each pull-up). \nWhen we swing trade  a downtrend, we sell short  during a pull-up .  If you are \nunfamiliar with selling short , we discuss it in the next session.\nPage 18 \n \nFigure 2: down trend  \n4.4  The Steps in Swing Trading \nFirst, restrict your selection to the universe of stocks that fulfill certain criteria.  \nChoose stocks that … \n• Have a price of at least $7 \n• Have an average daily volume  of at least 500,000 shares \nThen … \nSTEP 1 – Identify a stock that is in an uptrend or a downtrend. \nSTEP 2 –  For stocks in an uptrend, identify th ose that are experiencing a pull-back.  \nFor stocks in a downtrend, identify those that are experiencing a pull-up. \nSTEP 3 –  Once an appropriate candidate is id entified, place a limit order to buy \n(uptrend) or sell short (downtrend) the stock based on the Master Plan. \nSTEP 4 –  Once a stock has been traded (a posi tion opened), place a stop-loss order \nto limit downside risk and place a limit order to identify the price at which \nyou will take profits.  (Ideally, these two orders are placed together as an\nPage 19 OCO (One Cancels Other) order; this  is sometimes called an OCA (One \nCancels All) order. \nSTEP 5 –  At the end of each day, adjust the stop loss prices based on the Master \nPlan. \n4.5 What Can You Expect? \nFirst –  only a portion of your trades will be executed.  The Master Plan  is designed \nto only trade stocks that initially move in the anticipated direction.  If the \nprice moves in the opposite direction (continues pulling back or pulling \nup), the trade is not placed. \nSecond – you will be holding positions for a limited amount of time.  While swing \ntrading  is not day trading, you are only holding positions until targets are \nmet. \nThird –  some of your trades will result in losses, however losses are minimized by \nthe Master Plan which raises the stops as the stock price rises; this is \nknown as trailing stops .  Being disciplined, and following the Master \nPlan will insure that profits exceed losses which means you will make \nmoney . \n4.6 How Do You Identify Stocks that are Appropriate \nfor Swing Trading? \nAll of the methods that are used to id entify stocks that are appropriate for swing \ntrading  are based on technical analysis .  Technical analysis is a way of using \nhistorical price/volume patterns to predict future behavior.  It is not necessary to \nhave a detailed understanding of technical analysis  in order to swing trade .  \nThere are tools available that can assist in vestors at every level – from novice to \nexpert.  While there are many sources of information and tools that help identify \nswing trading  opportunities, this book will focus on those provided at \nwww.mrswing.com .  Once you understand the principles, you can explore other \nsources of information. \n4.7 What Tools are Available? \nThe tools fall into several categories.\nPage 20 • Subscriptions services that provide daily swing trading recommendations – \nwww.mrswing.com  offers a service called MasterSwings .  Larry Swing uses \ntechnical analysis and pattern recognition software  (SwingTracker)  to \nidentify candidates for swing trading .  Every evening, subscribers receive e-\nmails that identify several different ty pes of patterns that are conducive to \nswing trading .  Aside from showing you the pattern, the email indicates the \ncurrent price, the entry price, the target  (limit) price for taking profit, and the \nstop loss price for limiting downside risk.  This service can be used by \ninvestors at all knowledge levels. \nAn example of a MasterSwings  email alert for Lockheed Martin (LMT) is \nshown on the next page.  A candlestick chart shows the recent price action for \nLMT, and a table indicates the closing pr ice and all three action prices – the \nprice to buy (using a buy stop order), the target price which is 7% above the \npurchase price (using a buy limit order) , and the protective stop price which \nis approximately 4% below the purchase price (using a sell stop order).  The \n20- and 50-day moving averages (MA) ar e also shown so that you can more \neasily visualize the di rection of the trend. \nThe rational behind these prices ar e discussed in the section entitled The \nMaster Plan .\nPage 21  \nLMT  \n(Lockheed Martin)  \nClose  BUY ABOVE  Stop \n68.55 70.03  68.44 \n7% Target  Resistance  Support  \n74.93 71.52 66.26 \n \n \n• Software that scans historical stock prices and identifies swing \ntrading patterns – SwingTracker  is a real time charting program available \nat www.mrswing.com  that is designed to identify swing trading  \nopportunities.  While SwingTracker  has many features (described in the \nAppendix), the scan feature is used to identify stocks whose price action \nshow patterns that make them good candidates for swing trading. \nThe scan feature allows you to identify patterns based on price history, \nvolume history, moving averages, technical indicators, candlestick criteria, and fundamental company characteristics.  Scan  criteria are saved in a scan \nlibrary  so they can be used over and ov er again.  A scan scenarios (also \ncalled a template ) can be used to evaluate pa tterns in over 6000 stocks on \nthe NYSE, the AMEX, and the NASDAQ.  Th is evaluation happens in real time. \nDuring the day, you can use SwingTracker  to watch the price and volume \nbehavior of individual stocks.  You can easily monitor stocks on a favorites  \nlist, and set alerts to tell you when pa rticular prices are reached.  These\nPage 22 features are available from other serv ices, usually at a higher cost than \nSwingTracker. \nSince SwingTracker  was designed by Mr. Swing, it comes with the ability to \nidentify his favorite swing trading patterns, including those used to identify \nstocks for the MasterSwings  service. \nWe will describe some of the criteria used to select swing trading candidates \nin the section entitled Pattern Recognition Criteria .\nPage 23 • MrSwing Lite is a free newsletter that is published once a week – it identifies \nseveral stocks that are good long and short  swing trading opportunities.  You \ncan look at the price pattern and obtain the necessary quote information \n(previous day’s high, low and close) using web sites like \nwww.yahoo.quotes.com  or www.stockchartz.com . \nNot surprisingly, MrSwing recommends using SwingTracker  to examine the \nprice patterns and quote information because it is  specifically designed for swing trading.  Choose the tools that  suit your needs and your budget.\nPage 24 5 Pattern Recognition Criteria \nWhile looking at a chart can often tell you whether a stock is appropriate for swing \ntrading , it is very time consuming to look at charts, particularly if you look for \nopportunities every day.  Another way to iden tify good stocks is to use software that \ncan scan all of the listed stocks based on  a series of algebr aic equations that \nrepresent the characteristics of a good chart pattern.  I use SwingTracker to \naccomplish this task. \nBefore discussing the specifics of pattern recognition criteria , we’ll briefly \nconsider the measures used in the algebrai c equations.  Some of the measures are \nsimple descriptive variables (e .g., the high price for the previous day  or the average \nvolume over the past 20 days).  Other measures are based on technical analysis  \nwhich is discussed in more detail in the Appendix.  Technical analysis  has many \ndifferent indicators from a simple moving average to a complex oscillator.  It is not necessary to have an in-depth understanding  of technical analysis  to be a successful \nswing trader, however, it is helpful to ha ve a rudimentary understanding of how we \napproach swing trading pattern recognition. \n5.1 Technical Analysis Measures used to Recognize \nSwing Trading Patterns \nTo begin with, we typi cally restrict our selections to stocks that are at least $12 in \nprice, having an average (20 day) daily volume of at least 500,000 shares.  Since \nmarket makers can more easily manipulate low price, low volume stocks, we stay away from them. \nFor long swings  we are interested in identifying stocks that are in an uptrend.  One \nof the indicators we use is a simple moving average (SMA).  A moving average is \nsimply the average closing price for a partic ular number of days.  It’s called a moving \naverage because on each new day, the curre nt day’s price is added to the average \nwhile the oldest price is dropped.  We typically focus on three moving averages, \nthose based on 10 days, 20 days and 50 days.  All moving averages smooth the price movement and make it easier to identify  trends.  It is also significant to know \nwhere today’s price is relative to the movi ng averages and whether the shorter time-\nframe moving average is above or below th e longer time-frame moving average.  \nTwo indicators that a stock is in an uptrend are:\nPage 25 • Today’s closing price is above both the 10-day and 20-day moving averages \n• The 10-day moving average is above the 20-day moving average \nWhen looking for a long swing , we would like to identify stocks that are \nexperiencing a brief decline (pullback).  We can identify a 3-day pullback as follows. \n• Today’s high price is lowe r than yesterday’s high \n• Yesterday’s high is lower th an the high the day before \nWe also use a technical indicator deve loped by Dr. Alexander Elder called the Force \nIndex .  This index combines the magnitude of the price change with the direction of \nthe change and the trading volume.  In orde r to confirm the relative force behind an \nuptrend and a pullback, we use a 3-da y moving average and a 13-day moving \naverage of the Force Index.  The following  conditions demonstrate that the bears \nhave been winning the short-term battle while bulls are dominating the longer \nframe: \n• The 3-day moving average of the Force Index is less than 0, and \n• The 13-day moving average of the Force Index is greater than 0 \nAnother technical indicator we like to use is the Directional Movement Index (DMI) \nthat was developed by J.

The \nformulas will be built into the next version of SwingTracker .\nPage 26 6 The Master Plan – Entry and exit rules that \ninsure successful swing trading \n6.1 WHAT is the Master Plan \nThe Master Plan  is a set of rules that determines wh en to enter and exit a trade.  At \nfirst, it might seem a little complicated, but once you have place a few trades using the system, you’ll realize it’s really quite simple.  The best part about the Master \nPlan is that you don’t need to use judgm ent.  The rules are mechanical.  Two \nobstacles to successful trading are the hum an emotions of fear and greed.  By \nfollowing the Master Plan, these emotions will not influence your behavior, nor will \nthey interfere with your success. \nTo keep it simple, we’ll first focus on the long trade.  The rules for a short trade are \nsimply the mirror image of the rules fo r a long trade.  An example of a long swing  \nopportunity is shown below.  The price has declined (pulled back) and you are bullish on the stock. s The secret to swing trading success is: \nConfidence, Discipline, Focus and Patience\nPage 27 6.2 Taking a Profit and Preserving Capital \nAn important aspect of the Master Plan  is setting a profit target and preserving \ncapital.  The approach is fairly conservative – the profit target is approximately 7% with a potential loss capped at 4%.  The actual profit is likely to be more than 7% while a loss is likely to be smaller than 4%.  Here’s how it works.  \n• Once the target price is reached (7% above the entry price), half of the \nshares are sold, locking in a 7% profit.  The other shares remain invested to benefit from any further increase in price. \n• If the price moves against the trade, the maximum loss tolerated is 4%.  This \npreserves capital for future trades. \n• Typically, more trades will produce a profit than a loss.  The net result is profit. \n• The movement of the entire market is very powerful.  When the market is \nmoving with your trades, a very high percentage of your trades will be \nprofitable. \n• When the entire market is moving agains t your trade, a higher than expected \npercentage of your trades will lose.  The stop loss  protects you from \nexcessive losses. \n6.2.1 Profit is taken using a “sell limit” order – once the \nprice is reached, the specified number of shares are sold. \n6.2.2 Capital is protected using a “stop loss” order – \nwhen the stop price is reached, all the shares are sold.\nPage 28  \n6.3 When to Enter the Trade  \nUsing the Master Plan , swing trading opportunities ar e identified after the market \ncloses.  Trades are entered in the morning,  usually within the first half hour of \ntrading.  When you enter the trade (and the decision rule you use) depends on \nwhether or not the stock has gapped up or  down from the previous day’s closing \nprice.  According to the Master Plan , a stock is considered to have gapped up when \nit opens 50 cents or more higher than the pr evious day’s close; it is considered to \nhave gapped down when it opens 50 cents lower than the previous day’s close.  \nMost frequently , the stock price will open within 50 cents of the previous day’s \nclose, neither gapping up nor gapping down. \n• The most common occurrence – the stoc k opens within 50 cents ($0.50) of \nthe previous day’s close – the order ca n be placed a few minutes after the \nmarket opens. \n• Occasionally a stock gaps up 50 cents or more compared to the previous \nday’s close – the order is placed at le ast 30 minutes after the market opens. \n• Occasionally a stock gaps down 50 cent s or more compared to the previous \nday’s close – the order is placed appr oximately 5 minutes after the market \nopens. \n• To summarize, if the stock gaps in the same direction  as the trade, wait 30 \nminutes , and if the stock gaps in the opposite direction  of the trade, wait \n5 minutes . \n6.4 How to Enter the Trade  \nAs with when to trade , how to enter depends on whether the stock gaps up/down \nor not.  Typically, the stock price doesn’ t gap up or down and the entry price is \nbased on the previous day’s prices.  When the stock gaps up or down, the entry price \nis not based on the previous day’s prices, but on the current day’s prices.  Whether s  Buying AFTER the open is BETTER \n Wait a few moments to allow the market to \nbreath normally\nPage 29 based on the previous day’s prices or the current day’s prices, the entry rules are the \nsame. \n• The most common occurrence – the stock opens within 50 cents \n($0.50) of the previous day’s close  – buy the stock the moment it trades \n6 cents  (1/16) above the previous day’s high.  This can be accomplished by \nusing a buy stop order.  This increases the likelihood that the price is moving \nin the direction of the bullish (long) trade. \n• Occasionally a stock gaps up or down 50 cents or more  – buy the stock \nthe moment it trades 6 cents  above the high of the new day .  This would be \n30 minutes after the market opens for a gap up or 5 minutes after the \nmarket opens for a gap down . \n6.5 What to do After the Trade is Executed \nOnce the trade is executed, the exit orders are placed. \n• The profit order – a sell limit  order is placed at a price that is 7% above the \nentry price. \n• The capital preservation order – a sell stop (stop limit)  order is placed at \n4% below the entry price OR 6 cents below  the low of the day that was \nused for the trade (whichever is higher ) – for a stock that opened without a \ngap the previous day sets the prices; fo r a stock that opened with a gap, the \nprice action before the day (high and low) sets the prices.\nPage 30 6.6 What to do the Day After the Trade is Executed \nAs with when to trade and how to enter , the following day’s activity  depends on \nwhether the stock gaps up/down or not.  If the stock price doesn’t gap up or down, the stop loss  is changed based on the previous day’s prices.  If the stock gaps up or \ndown, the stop loss is changed based on the current day’s prices.  Whether based \non the previous day’s prices or the current day’s prices, stop loss rule is the same. \n• When the stock opens within 50 cents ($0.50) of the previous day’s \nclose  – if 6 cents  below the previous day’s low is higher than yesterday’s \nstop loss , raise the stop loss to this new price .   This is known as raising the \ntrailing stop , which further limits the downside risk. \n• When the stock gaps up or down 50 cents or more  – wait 30 minutes  \nfor a gap down  or 5 minutes  for a gap up  – if 6 cents  below the today’s \nlow is higher than yesterday’s stop loss , raise the stop loss  to this new \nprice. \n6.7 What happens if the Trade is Not Executed \nLet’s say that you are receiving recommendations from MasterSwings  or MrSwing \nLite and your trade is not executed on the day the order is placed.  You can repeat \nthe process for up to 5 trading days. \n• If the stock gaps up or down, wait the appropriate amount of time (30 \nminutes for a gap up and 5 minutes fo r a gap down) – determine the entry \nand exit prices based on the current day’s prices. \n• If the stock opens with 50 cents of yester day’s close, the entry and exit prices \nare based on the previous day’s prices. \nThe chart on the following page should make the trading rules clear.\nPage 31 To d Stock Opens with a Gap \nWait 30 MinutesLong Swin g \nWait 5 MinutesYes \nYes Gap \nDown  Gap \nUp \n• Buy stop 6 cents \nabove today's price \n• Sell stop at whichever \nis higher – 4% below entry price or 6 cents below today’s low \n• Sell limit for half the \nshares at 7% above \nthe purchase price • Okay to place order \nwhen market opens \n• Buy stop 6 cents above \nyesterday's high \n• Sell stop at whichever \nis higher – 4% below entry price or 6 cents below yesterday’s low \n• Sell limit for half the \nshares at 7% above \nthe purchase price No \nStock is Purchased \nNext Day \nStock Opens with a Gap Yes \nYes Gap \nUp \nGap \nDown  No \n• Sell limit for ½ the \nshares remains the same \n• Sell stop – whichever\n \nis higher – \nyesterday’s stop lossor 6 cents below yesterday’s low • Wait 5 minutes \n• Sell limit for ½ the \nshares remains the same \n• Sell stop – whichever \nis higher – yesterday’s stop loss\n \nor 6 cents below \nyesterda y’s low • Wait 30 minutes \n• Sell limit for ½ the \nshares remains the same \n• Sell stop – whichever \nis higher – yesterday’s stop loss\n \nor 6 cents below yesterday’s low Repeat until the  \nposition closes.  \nSell stop closes the 2\nnd half of \nthe position. No \nYes – Repeat for up to 5 trading days\nPage 32 6.8 Once half the shares close at a 7% profit, the \nother half remains open to “ride the wave”.  \nWhen do we close the second half of the trade? \nA trailing stop  is used to close the 2nd half of the trade.  Remember that a trailing \nstop is used to raise the sell stop  (stop loss) during the trade.  The same rules \napply (see 6 .6 above).  The shares are sold when the price drops to 6 cents below \nthe low of previous day (no gap on open ) or the current day (gap on open). \n6.9 The Short Swing – how we make money when we \nthink the price of the stock is going down \nA short swing is used to make money when a stock’s price is predicted to go down.  \nWe sell short the stock.  For those unfamiliar with shorting stocks, we sell the \nstock without having previously owned it.  Additional detail about shorting stocks can \nbe found the Appendix.  For now, it is only necessary to know that our goal is to sell \nthe stock and buy it back at a lower price. \nWhile anyone can sell short, you must make  sure that your brokerage account is \napproved for trading on margin .   If you do not have a margin account , simply fill \nout the necessary forms with your current brokerage firm or open an account with \none of the firms recommended for swing trading. \nA short swing  is a mirror image of a long swing .  The price of a stock in a \ndowntrend tends to have periodic, short-term rallies (pull-ups) as the price moves \nlower.  The set up for a short swing  is the brief rally (or pull-up).  The decision \nrules in the Master Plan help enter the trade when th e stock is resuming it’s \ndownward path. \nA chart showing a downtrend that is conducive to short swing trading  is shown on \nthe next page.\nPage 33 Notice in the chart below that the downtrend is interrupted by short-term rallies \n(pull-ups).  The trade is placed after a short-term rally (or pull-up), once the stock resumes its downtrend. \nThe trade is entered on a day when the pric e falls below the low of the previous day. \nThe rules for entering and exiting a short swing  are shown schematically on the \nnext page. \nWhile the rules might seem somewhat co mplicated, several brokerage firms make \nthe process quite easy.  Interactive Brokers  – described in the next section – \nallows you to enter the three components of  the trade all at the same time.  For a \nshort swing  they are: \n• A sell stop  to sell the stock when the price moves below the stop price  \n• A buy stop  to buy back the shares if the price moves up 4% \n• A buy limit  to lock in profits (on ½ the shares) when the price drops 7% \nThe schematic diagram provides instructions  for how to adjust these prices on the \nsecond day, third day, and so on, based on whether the stock has been sold short  \nor not.  The schematic provides exit instructions as well.\nPage 34 7 Preferred Brokers Stock Opens with a Gap \nWait 5 MinutesShort Swin g \nWait 30 MinutesYes \nYes Gap \nDown  Gap \nUp \n• Sell stop 6 cents \nbelow today's price \n• Buy stop at whichever  \nis lower – 4% above \nentry price or 6 cents above today’s high \n• Buy limit for ½ the \nshares at 7% below \nthe purchase price • Okay to place order \nwhen market opens \n• Sell stop 6 cents below \nyesterday's low \n• Buy stop at whichever is  \nlower – 4% above entry\nprice or 6 cents above yesterday’s high \n• Buy limit for ½ the \nshares at 7% below the\n \npurchase price No \nStock is Sold Short \nNext Day \nStock Opens with a Gap Yes \nYes Gap \nUp \nGap \nDown  No \n• Buy limit for ½ the \nshares remains the same \n• Buy stop – whichever\n \nis lower – \nyesterday’s stop lossor 6 cents above yesterday’s high • Wait 30 minutes \n• Buy limit for ½ the \nshares remains the same \n• Buy stop – whichever \nis lower – yesterday’s stop loss\n \nor 6 cents above \nyesterda y’s high • Wait 5 minutes \n• Buy limit for ½ the \nshares remains the same \n• Buy stop – whichever\n \nis lower – \nyesterday’s stop loss  \nor 6 cents above yesterday’s high Repeat until the  \nposition closes.  \nBuy stop closes the 2\nnd half of \nthe position.

That \nis why, as human traders, we try to simplif y trading as much as possible, in order to \nscan fast & accurate trading opportunities in  a few seconds. As Albert Einstein used \nto say: keep things as simple as possible nut not any simpler! \nThe following Technical Analysis (TA) tools are part of the daily charting arsenal: \n Candle stick \n Volume \n Equivolume \n MA (???) \n Force Index \n DMI \n Up/Down/In/Out \n ... \n8.2 Why does Technical Analysis work? \nSimply because the large professional traders cannot help leaving behind \nconsiderable evidence regarding their opinion on the direction of the market: volume \nprovides clues as to the intensity of a given price move... \nThe key is psychology: you trade people , not stocks. People never change...most \ntraders keep on making the same mistakes again and again...luckily for us. Read this again and think about it! \n8.3 The Basics  \nA stock price is determined by an exchan ge between buyers and sellers. If there \nhappens to be more buyers than sellers then  the market goes up. On the contrary, if \nthere happens to be more sellers than buye rs then the market goes down. Logical!\nPage 37 The price at which a stock is offered affects the trader's decision. If a trader is long \nand the stock starts to decline, the trader could be forced to close his position. If short, he might do likew ise on a rising stock. \n \nWhen a trader takes a long position, he becomes a potential seller, while short \npositions are held by potential buyers. As prices change due to buying and selling pressure, information about the condition of the stock is revealed by the combination of price and volume action. \n8.4 Japanese Candle sticks  \nIn the 1600s, the Japanese developed a method  of technical analysis to analyze the \nprice of rice contracts. This technique is called candlestick charting. Steven Nison is \ncredited with popularizing candlestick charting and is now recognized as the leading expert on their interpretation.  \nCandlestick charts display the open, high, low, and closing prices in a format similar \nto a modern-day bar-chart, but in a manner that extenuates the relationship \nbetween the opening and closing prices. Candlestick charts are simply a new way of looking at price; they don't involve any calculations. \n \nFigure 3: An open candle stick chart\nPage 38 \n \nFigure 4: a closed candle stick chart  \n8.5 Volume  \nVolume is simply the number of shares tr aded during a given timeframe (e.g., hour, \nday, week, month, etc.). The analysis of  volume is a basic yet very important \ncomponent of technical analysis. Volume provides clues as to the intensity of a given price move. \nHigh volume levels are characteristic of  market tops when there is a strong \nconsensus that prices will move higher. High volume levels are also very common at the beginning of new trends (i.e., when prices break out of a trading range). Also, \njust before market bottoms, volume will often increase due to panic-driven selling.  \nVolume can help determine the strength of  an existing trend. A strong up-trend \nshould have higher volume on the upward legs of the trend, and lower volume on the downward (corrective) legs. Similarly, strong downtrends usually have higher volume on the downward legs of the trend and lo wer volume on the upward (corrective) \nlegs.  \n8.6 Equivolume \nEquivolume displays prices in a manner that emphasizes the relationship between price and volume. Equivolume was develo ped by Richard W. Arms, Jr., and is \nexplained in greater detail in his book “Volume Cycles in the Stock Market”  \nInstead of displaying volume as an \"after thought\" on the lower margin of a chart, \nEquivolume combines price and volume in a two-dimensional box. The top line of the box is the high for the period and the botto m line is the low for the period. The width \nof the box is the unique feature of Equivo lume - it represents the volume for the \nperiod.\nPage 39 \n \nFigure 5: Equivolume \nThe shape of each Equivolume box provides  a picture of the supply and demand for \nthe security during a specific trading pe riod. Short and wide boxes (heavy volume \naccompanied with small changes in price) tend to occur at turning points, while tall and narrow boxes (light volume accompanied with large changes in price) are more \nlikely to occur in established trends.  \nEspecially important are boxes that penetr ate support or resistance levels, since \nvolume confirms penetrations  \nA \"power box\" is one in which both height and width increase substantially. Power \nboxes provide excellent confirmation of a breakout. A narrow box, due to light \nvolume, casts doubt on the validity of a breakout in question.  \nWe always look at volume in relation with price movement: \nq \nVolume  Trend Reversal \n Above-Average Volume with LITTLE price movement \n Above-Average Volume after a huge advance or decline  \nTrend Continuation \n Above-Average Volume with STRONG price movement \n Above-Average Volume with breakout \n Below-Average Volume with NO price movement\nPage 40  \n \nFigure 6: Volume \n8.7 Moving Averages \nA Moving Average (MA) is an indicator that  shows the average value of a security's \nprice over a period of time. When calcul ating a moving average, a mathematical \nanalysis of the security's average value over a predetermined time period is made. \nAs the security's price changes, it s average price moves up or down. \nSimple MA = (P1 + P2 + ... + Pn) / n \nwhere P is the price being averaged and n is the number of days in the MA  \nThere are five popular types of moving averages: simple (also referred to as \narithmetic), exponential, triangular, variab le, and weighted. Moving averages can be \ncalculated on any data series including a se curity's open, high, low, close, volume, or \nanother indicator. I use only the 10-20 & 50 day simple MA on closing prices.  \nTRENDS  UpTrend:\nPage 41  Higher Highs & Higher Lows \n Rising MA10 & MA20  \n Higher volume on the upward legs \n closing prices ABOVE the MA20 & MA50 \n an Uptrend stock will find support at either the 20 \nor 50 day MA \nDownTrend: \n Lower Highs & Lower Lows \n Falling MA10 & MA20  \n Higher volume on the downward legs \n closing prices BELOW the MA20 & MA50 \n a downtrend stock will find resistance at either the \n20 or 50 day MA\nPage 42 \n \nSwingTracker ©  \n8.8 Force Index \nForce Index is an oscillator developed by Dr. Alexander Elder in his excellent book: \n“Trading for a Living”. \nForce Index combines the three most esse ntial pieces of market information: \n the direction of price change \n its extent  \n its trading volume. \nIt provides a new, practical way of using volume to make trading decisions. \nForce Index Force Index = Volume(today) * (C lose(today) - Close(yesterday))  \nAlthough Force Index can be used raw, I prefer to smooth them with moving \naverage: \nLarry’s Index FI-3days MA & FI-13days MA\nPage 43 A 3-day MA of Force Index is a very sens itive indicator which shows the short-term \nbattle between the bulls and th e bears. And the 13-day MA of Force Index identifies \nthe longer-term battle be tween bulls and bears. \nForce Index  BUY opportunity : \n FI-13MA => 0 \n FI-3MA <= 0 \n UPTREND  \nSELL opportunity: \n FI-13MA =<0 \n FI-3MA >= 0 \n DOWNTREND  \n \n \nFigure 7: moving index\nPage 44 8.9 Directional Moving Index  \nThe Directional Movement Index (DMI) is a trend-following indica tor developed by J. \nWelles Wilder, Jr., designed to determine whether a security is in a trending or non-trending market. Since the market is in a strong trend only about 30% of the time \nand in sideways about 70% of the time, this indicator is used to capture the period when the market shows significant tr ending or directional behavior.  \nThe calculation of the DMI is fairly complex and consists of three lines:  \nDMI +DI: current positive directional in dex, the range of highs divided \nby the price range over the last day and previous close, smoothed \nover a given number of periods. \n-DI: current negative directional in dex, the range of lows divided \nby the price range over the last day and previous close, smoothed \nover a given number of periods. \nADX: modified moving average of the difference of +DI and -DI \ndivided by the sum of +DI and -DI, multiplied by 100. \nUpTrend: \n ADX > 30 the higher the better \n +DI > -DI \nDownTrend: \n ADX > 30 the higher the better \n -DI > +DI  \n8.10  Up/Down/In/Out   \nUp/Down/In/Out is a chart overlay available on SwingTracker (software I recently \ndeveloped) that color-code s individual bars or cand lesticks based on price \nmovement. It relates the current high and low price with the previous high and low \nprice. \nUp (Green) indicates the current high is higher than the previous high and the \ncurrent low is higher than the previous low.\nPage 45 Down (Red) indicates the current high is lower than the previous high and the \ncurrent low is lower than the previous low. \nIn (Yellow) indicates the current high is lower than the previous high, and the \ncurrent low is higher than previous low. \nOut (Blue) indicates that the current high is higher than the previous high, and the \ncurrent low is lower than the previous low.\nPage 46 9 SwingTracker \nSwingTracker 4.0 is quote, scan and charts software designed specifically for Swing \nTraders.

Let's get started.  \n10.1 Starting with SwingLab  \nSwing traders seek pivot points in stocks - gaps, breakouts and reversals - with a 1 \nto 5-day time horizon. Here are some of th e scans that I use... if you find one that \nyou like, send it to swinglab@mrswing.com  with your name, an d we may add it to \nour growing library on our website. \n10.1.1 Starting to swing... \nAll the scans presented here are End-of -Day.

So you have all the time in the world to \nbe prepared to swing these stocks like a PRO. \nLet’s start with our first scan: this is the first scan we execute every single trading \nday. \n \n q  Why does swing trading work? \nBecause you are trading in the direction of the trend.  You \nwait for a pullback before entering the trade, and you enter \nonly if the stock shows a sign that it’s price will continue in \nthe direction of the trend.\nPage 55 Swings \nthe stock must be experiencing a minor decline/pullback \nwithin the context of a uptrend  \nor \nthe stock must be experiencing a minor rally as part of a downtrend  \nTitle: FORCESWING \nLONG  We use this scan to search for stock that \nhas been in an uptrend but experiencing \na minor decline/pullback.  \nWith this scan we try to detect stocks for \npotential long swing trades.   \nCode: MAV20 >= 500000  AND we stay away from stocks that trade less than \n500,000 shares of the 20-day Volume \nAverage to ensure liquidity (sometimes we \nuse 250,000 instead, depending on market \nconditions)   \n CLOSE> 12 AND to be sure we do not trade cheap stocks \n(sometimes we use 7$ instead, depending on market conditions)\n  \n CLOSE > SMAC10 and CLOSE > \nSMAC20 AND  to be sure the stock is still in an uptrend    \n HIGH < HIGH1 and HIGH1 < HIGH2 AND\n the stock must be experiencing a 3 day \ndecline/pullback  within the context of a \nuptrend    \n FORCE3<=0 AND FORCE13>=0 \nAND the short  term battle is now won by the \nbears , but still the bulls  are in control  of the \nlonger -term battle   \n ADX20>30  to be sure the stock is still trending   \n (s): swings  long   \n     \nOnly trade what you like !\nPage 56  \nTitle: FORCESWING \nSHORT  We use this scan to search for stock that \nhas been in an downtrend but has \nexperiencing a minor rally . \nWith this scan we try to detect stocks for \npotential short  swing trades.   \nCode: MAV20 >= 500000  AND we stay away from stocks that trade less than \n500,000 shares of the 20-day Volume \nAverage to ensure liquidity (sometimes we \nuse 250,000 instead, depending on market \nconditions)   \n CLOSE> 12 AND to be sure we do not trade cheap stocks \n(sometimes we use 7$ instead, depending on market conditions)\n  \n CLOSE < SMAC10 and CLOSE < \nSMAC20 AND  to be sure the stock is still in an downtrend    \n LOW > LOW1 and LOW1 > LOW2 AND\n the stock must be experiencing a 3 day \nRALLY  within the context of a DOWNtrend    \n  FORCE3<=0 AND FORCE13>=0 \nAND the short  term battle is now won by the \nbulls , but still the bears  are in control  of the \nlonger -term battle   \n ADX20>30  to be sure the stock is still trending   \nType(s):  swings  short\nPage 57 10.1.2 Cut and Paste \nHere is how to cut and paste SwingLab scans into SwingTracker.

What about \nthe times you come across a stock that you wo uldn't invest a cent in, you know that \nthing is doomed, a sure loser. If you knew that the stock was going to decline \nwouldn't be nice to be able to profit from its decline.  \nWell you can profit from the decline of a st ock and although it sounds easy, there are \nsubstantial risks and pitfalls that you need to watch out for. The mechanics of a short \nsale are somewhat complicated and the invest or's risks are high so it is important \nthat you understand the transaction befo re getting into it. Let’s dive in! \n12.1.1 What does it mean to sell short?  \nIf you sell a stock you don't own, you are selling short. (Yes, it's legal.) You are now \nshort the stock. \nA short seller sells a stock that he believes will fall in value. A short seller does not \nown the stock before he sells it. Instead,  he borrows it from someone who already \nowns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock \nto close out the loan. If the stock has fallen in price since he sold short, he can buy \nthe stock back for less than he received for selling it. The difference is his profit. \nShort selling allows investors to profit from falling stock prices. \"Buy low, sell high\" is \nthe goal of both short selling and purchasing shares (\"going long\"). A short sale reverses the order of a typical stock purc hase: the stock is sold first and bought \nlater. \nFor example, in September 1987, Bob thinks  IBM is overvalued. She sells short 100 \nshares of IBM at $175 per share. The stoc k market crashes in October and IBM's \nshares fall to $125 per share. Bob buys ba ck 100 shares of IBM and closes out the \nshort sale. Bob gains the difference betw een the sales proceeds and the purchase \ncosts and pockets $5,000 from the short sale, excluding transaction costs. \n12.1.2 Where Does The Broker Get The Stock? \nThe short answer is from other customers.  Oddly enough, he doesn't have to ask \npermission!\nPage 70 Short selling is a marginable ( ???) transaction. In plain English, that means you must \nopen a margin account to sell short. This is the same account you would use if you \nwant to use your stocks as collatera l to borrow money from your broker.  \nWhen you open a margin account, you must sign a hypothecation / rehypothecation \nagreement. This hypothecation agreement says you will pledge your stocks as collateral against your loan. The re-hypothecation agreement allows your broker to loan your stocks to a bank, or to other customers!  \n12.1.3 How Do I Sell Short? \nUnlike a stock purchase transaction, which involves two parties (the buyer and the seller), short selling involves three parties: the original owner, the short seller, and \nthe new buyer. The short seller borrows shares from the original owner, and \nimmediately sells them on the open market to any willing buyer. To finalize (\"close out\") the short sale transaction, the shor t seller must then go out into the stock \nmarket and buy the same amount of shares as  he sold so that the broker can return \nthem to the original owner. \nTo sell short you first must set up a marg in account with your broker. A margin \naccount allows you borrow fr om your brokerage company using the value of your \nportfolio as collateral. The general rule is that the value of your portfolio must equal at least 50% of the size of the short sale transaction. In other words, If you have \n$1,000 worth of stock in your margin account, you can borrow $2,000 of stock to sell short. \nTo sell a stock short, you must borrow stock.  To initiate a short sale, you simply call \nup your broker and ask to sell short a spec ific number of shares of your selected \nstock. Your broker then checks with th e Margin Department to see whether the \nshares are available or can be borrowed fr om another brokerage, usually while you \nwait on the phone for a minute. If they are available, the brokerage borrows the \nshares, sells them in the open market, and puts the proceeds into your margin \naccount. To close out your sh ort sale, you tell your broker  that you want to buy the \nsame number of shares that you shorted. The broker will purchase the shares for \nyou using the money in your margin account, return the shares and close out the short sale transaction. \nWhile your short sale is outstanding, your account will be charged interest against \nthe value of the short position. If the stock you shorted goes up in price, or the value\nPage 71 of the stock you are using as collateral goes down in price, so that your collateral is \nless than the \"maintenance\" requirement (u sually 30% of the value of the short \nposition) you will be required to add money to your margin account or buy back the \nstock that you sold short. You must also  pay any dividends issued by the company \nwhose stock you sold short. \n12.1.4 Up Tick Rule \nTo sell your stock short, you must adhere to the up-tick rule. The transaction before \nyour short sale must have been executed  at a higher price than the transaction \nbefore it. In other words, the transaction befo re your short sale must be an up-tick.  \nIn practice, you cannot short a stock that is already falling in price. Otherwise, short \nselling would amplify the decline.  \n12.1.5 Why Sell Short? \nThe two primary reasons for selling short are opportunism and portfolio protection. \nOccasionally investors see a st ock that they believe has b een hyped to a ridiculously \nhigh level. They believe that the stock price will fall when reality replaces the hype. A short sale provides the opportunity to prof it from the overpriced stock. Short sales \nare also used to protect an investor's portfolio against a market downturn. By \nshorting stocks that the investor believes will fall sharply when the market as a \nwhole falls, investors can help insulate the value of their portfolios against sudden market drops. \nZitel provides an example of opportunistic short selling. In 1996, Zitel was caught up \nin a wave of investor enthusiasm because it has a stake in a company that fixes the \ncomputer glitch that causes computers to interpret dates in the next century (2000s) \nas dates in this century (1900s). This pr oblem, known as the \"Year 2000\" problem, \nsuddenly became a hot topic of  conversation and made it to the covers of Time and \nNewsweek. In September 1996, Zitel was se lling for $7 per share. By December, the \nshares topped $70. At this point, many in vestors thought the stock was overpriced \nand saw an opportunity to make money by selling it short. If an investor had sold short in December 1996, he could have bought the stock back for $15 per share in \nApril 1997. Selling short would have allowed the investor to take very profitable \nadvantage of the opportunity presente d by the overpriced Zitel stock.\nPage 72 Short selling is also used to protect portfolios against erosion due to a broad market \ndecline. Short sellers make money when stock prices fall. An investor can diversify a long portfolio by adding some short positions. The portfolio will then have positions \nthat make money both when prices rise  and when they fall. This reduces the \nvolatility in the portfolio's returns and helps protect the value of the portfolio when prices are falling. \nBy shorting carefully selected stocks that are priced near their peak but that will fall \nsharply if the market falls, an investor ca n use the profits from the short sales to \nhelp offset losses in his long position to protect the value of his portfolio. \nFor example, Bob has most of his wealth tied up in stocks which she has bought \nbecause she expects them to appreciate in price. But she is concerned that the stock \nmarket is vulnerable to a sharp drop and wants to protect his savings while staying \ninvested in the market. She knows that market drops are often caused by a change \nof investor sentiment from optimism to pessimism. She id entifies businesses that are \nnot worth much today, but whose stock price is high because people hold high hopes \nfor their future prospects. These stocks shou ld be especially susceptible to a negative \nshift in sentiment since optimism is what principally drives their stock price. She then sells these stocks short. If investors beco me more pessimistic and the market falls \nthese stocks should fall more than most. Larry can use the profits from these short \nsales to offset losses in the rest of his portfolio. This will help to protect the value of his portfolio.\nPage 73 13 Appendix B– Ressources \nI highly recommend the following Books on (swing) trading written by expert traders \nor excellent pedagogues.

From the time I was 10 years old, I\nwas looking for ways to save some money from the small amount of change my parents\ngave me, or to do some tiny business, like selling candy to my schoolmates so I could\nget a few pennies for me. I knew if I had a little money saved I could just buy that comic\nbook I wanted by myself, or that other video game I liked or some new strings for my\nguitar, and my parents wouldn’t be able to tell me “no.” Not that they would tell me\n“no” very often, but the choice was mine if I had the money myself, and that was enough\nto motivate me to find ways to make extra money here and there. \n \nAfter all this year\ns–\nI am 37 no\nw–\n I didn’t change much. I was never very good at\nkeeping jobs and mostly I have been starting businesses and doing freelance jobs since I\nwas 20. But, despite my personal feelings about money, I believe that, in the times\nwe’re living, the ultimate goal is to have financial freedom, maybe even more than any\nother kind of freedom. I believe we have, as a generation, already discovered that the\nworld is too big to be trapped within one job, one career, one country, let alone one city.\nIf we control our own supply of money, we’re free, we own our time, and we can\ndecide what to do with it.\n \nMost of my friends, and people I know around the world, are dreaming about going for\nsome time to live to Asia, to South America, to Africa, to Europe, Mexico, USA,\nAustralia, or to any place far away from where they currently reside.\n \nIt doesn’t matter if you are married and have children, in that case you may want to take\nyour family with you, so the kids can learn another culture and another language; or, if\nyou are single, you want to go and live some grand adventures so you can feel you are\nliving your life to the fullest.\nEntrepreneurship is growing and many people are trying their luck at selling something,\nstarting some business on the side, doing some freelance job or at least dreaming of it\nand preparing themselves to find the right moment to start doing it.\n \nFor our parents and grandparents generation, these dreams of traveling far and finding\nadventure somewhere else on the globe, or starting a business on their own, running\nfrom the idea of the financial stability a real job will give you, was more or less an\nillusion. Most people were trapped, or self-trapped, in the idea of having a job, a\nfamily, a house, and living a little better each year and saving for retirement.\n \nMaybe because of the housing crisis, the Internet era, social networks, the higher rates\nof unemployment all around the world, or everything that is happening together, we’ve\nlearned that the old values of the “perfect” life are no longer valid. This has opened to\nus the doors and our eyes to find our future somehow in a different manner.\n \nWe’ve seen 22-year-old guys selling their companies (some of them without even make\na dime of profit) for billions, and we’ve all read stories about Internet entrepreneurs,\ntraders, marketers and all kind of people who are living the “great life” but began in a\nvery similar ground of where you and I could be standing now.\n \nThe good news is that you don’t need to be the next Mark Zuckerberg to live an\nindependent life. You don’t need a degree from an Ivy League school so you may enter\nin into this “elite” group of people, because there’s no gatekeeper here. And, yes, I\nknow, because I’ve done it myself. Trading and the Forex market is a way of gaining this\n…the highly regarded financial freedom.\nIMPORTANT WORD OF ADVICE:\n \nIt’s very necessary for me to tell you, before you read any further and maybe waste your\nvaluable time. This is not an advanced or comprehensive book covered with a lot of\ncomplicated strategies. This book doesn’t rely on highly sophisticated math, complex\nindicators, and academic analysis of the markets or any of the sorts. If you are an\nadvanced trader and are looking for the new high tech sophistication on finding your\nentry, you won’t find it here.\n \nIn the beginning of my trading career I was also trying to trade with difficult to\nunderstand and highly sophisticated systems based on complexity and they just didn’t\nwork for me. I’ll not say they will not work for you or the next guy, everyone is different\nand have different needs, but I’ve found out that to be profitable in my trading,\nsimplicity was a powerful and invaluable tool.\n \nWhy am I saying this to you? I’ve found some people that have been disappointed and\neven angry to find out that this book doesn’t have super advanced complicated extensive\ntrading techniques and, if you are looking for that, please stop reading and just give back\nthe book and we can part as friends.\n \nIn this book you will find my PERSONAL story on how I became a profitable trader in\nthe Forex Markets, it’s not a comprehensive text book about trading covering a great\ndeal of strategies or an extensive description of all about Forex trading. I don’t pretend\nthat this will be the only book you’ll read in your life to understand everything there is\nto understand about trading.\n \nYes it also has a few short chapters about my personal story, I thought they would be\ninteresting to read for many of you, since they’ll show you I am a human being and I\nhave had quite a hard time becoming a profitable trader and, in the meantime, I lost my\nlife savings and then found a way to earn them back from my trading.\n \nIf you are not interested in my personal story just skip the chapters and move on to the\nmore technical ones. They are all well labeled in the Table of Contents.\n \nMany of us have spent thousands of dollars learning to trade, courses, mentors, signals,\nrobots, etc. So please take into consideration the power of a simple affordable short\nbook like this one. I am sure it will help you in your trading but please understand it’s\njust a book, not a mentor or a full trading course.\n \nMy main purpose on writing this book is to show you how you too can become\nprofitable trading, basically by adjusting a few of your current habits and if you grasp\nsome concepts that maybe you were not aware of, even if you don’t spend the next ten\nyears learning all the technical and fundamental strategies known to man, or if you are\nworking a full time job or simply don’t have the personality to stare at the screen all\nyour day but still, want to make trading a viable option for earning extra income or even\nmake a living out of it.\n \nI’ll do show you a few strategies that work for me, but they are not the core concept I\nwant to communicate from this book. In my opinion there’s way more important subjects\nand concepts to grasp than to know a thousand techniques on how to find an entry or use\nindicators to find entries, and I will speak about these concepts through the book.\n \nI am a profitable trader and I have been making consistent money from the markets for\nmany years now and, if you read books from real traders, you will find that most of the\ntimes they use surprisingly simple strategies to find their entries.\n \nI’ve also learn that to overcomplicate yourself doesn’t normally work in the trading\nbusiness, because you will ad some extra variables on top of everything you already are\ntrying to cop with when you are trading.\n \nIs trading a viable option for everyone? Is it for you? Can anyone trade profitably?\n \nI can tell you it’s not for everyone. You need habits and discipline; if you start\nimprovising and following your guts, most likely you will fail (I am this person who\nloves improvising, I play jazz and all my life have gone using my gut feeling for\neverything, so I had a hard time learning how to do it, but in the end is quite easy, and\nyou can devote your creativity somewhere else, because you will have the time).\n \nIf you can’t stick to a plan and follow your own rules, if you get impatient and change\nyour strategy every time you lose a trade, or if you can’t deal with losing money,\nbecause trading is about winning and losing, too (but being profitable at the end of the\nmonth/year), most likely you will fail, too. \n \nBut, if you can just focus on repeating a series of simple analysis tasks; if you want to\nuse trading as a platform for doing other things in life that you love; if you don’t want to\nbe a slave to the screen, like you are in your regular office job; and have a life of your\nown, then you will have a chance to succeed.\n \nI wrote this book with the idea of helping traders who, like I was a few years ago, are\nstruggling to make money consistently, or are constantly losing money. In the book you\nwill find all the elements necessary to make the shift and become a successful trader,\nalthough if you are a complete newbie and have no idea about pips, pairs, brokers, and\nyou think candlesticks are only used in romantic dinners and birthday parties, you might\nwant to take some of the many beginner’s courses that you can find all around the\ninternet.\n \nIf you are a beginner trader with the basic knowledge, an intermediate trader with a few\nyears already in your back, or even an advanced one who got stuck, this book can help\nyou move your trading abilities to the next level. It’s based on simple but sound\nprinciples that are key to developing a winning strategy.\n \nI can promise you that if you follow the advice in this book and make a serious\ncommitment to change your trading habits, you will be in your way to become a\nprofitable trader. It can be hard at first, but it’s definitely something within your reach.\n \nIt’s important to understand that you need to make a big paradigm shift to trade\nprofitably. Normally, in most jobs, the more you do the more you accomplish. The more\nyou “work” the better you will do in the end. But, in trading, this common sense rule\nDOES NOT apply. The money you are making, or losing, is not based on how much\neffort you put to it, but on how well you implement a system. But, the system does its\nown magic by itself. The markets move by themselves, you don’t really have any impact\non the markets (unless you are a Central Bank moving a few hundred billions from here\nto there), so it’s crucial to your future success to remove this self-centered approach that\nis needed to succeed in most other lines of work.\n \nAnd, in the end, we lose our money and our dreams of freedom. Why? It is simply\nbecause the market has a huge component of randomness to it. A lot of what’s happening\nis simply noise. But our minds make a big effort to make sense from all of this noise and\nlook for patterns where there aren’t any. But, there is no need to. Noise doesn’t make\nsense. And all these hours of watching how noise does its thing are basically lost,\nworthless, a waste of time and better-spent going to the park and watching the snails\ncrawl in the grass.\n \nMost people – including myself – when they begin to trade, want to be glued to the\nscreen watching every little market move. Is it going up? Is it going down? It is forming\na flag! It’s touching a fib line!, I can see it!! The SMA is crossing now! I must enter!, and\nsuddenly the market moves exactly the other way, and we ask ourselves: why? It was so\nclear?\n \nSo, how do we step from all this noise into making money?\n \nPlease, if at any time, you have any questions you can write me to \npaul@forexlife.me\n or\nvisit my blog \nhttp://forexlife.me\n, I’ll be delighted to hear your thoughts about the book\nand any hurdles you might encounter in your own trading.\n \nAs a way to thank you for downloading my book At the end of this book there’s a\nlink to access my FREE Introductory Video Course on How To Start Making\nMoney in The Forex Markets.\nCLICK HERE\n If you want to go to the end of the book and directly access the course\n.\nH\nOW\n \nTO\n \nLOSE\n $50,000 \nWORKING\n \nVERY\n \nHARD\n(O\nNLY\n \nTO\n \nEARN\n \nIT\n \nBACK\n \nMANY\n \nTIMES\n \nOVER\n)\n \n \nI’ve been trading for over 7 years now. In those years, I have traded all: stocks, futures,\nForex, E-Minis, options, I’ve sold puts, iron condors, spreads, and binary options; you\nname it, I’ve tried it. And I can tell you I’ve lost a LOT of money doing it. I have been\nthe result of the marketers for financial information products many times and I can tell\nyou 99.9% of what they sell is pure crap.\n \nI’ve read somewhere, from the dozen of trading books I’ve read, that you have to pay\nthe cost of tuition, and boy, did I pay, and dearly.\n \nI’ve lost close to $50k in my first years of trading. Yes, $50,000 dollars on savings I\nhad. And I can tell you I was not rich or any of the sort, so it did hurt a lot to lose that\nmoney. It was my life savings.\n \nI also went to all kinds of trading material: Every time I found a new system, a new\nbook, a new indicator, a new strategy, a new course, a newsletter, MT4, Ninja Trader,\nsignals, robots, social trading, you name it: I bought it, tried it, and, yes, you guessed\nright: I failed at it. I even paid for one of this super expensive $4k trading coaches. And,\nyes. I failed with that, too, and lost some more money there, plus the cost of the coach.\n \nI’ve lost count on how many accounts I blew, on how many Forex, commodities, stock,\nor options brokers I’ve tried; only to find that it wasn’t about the broker or the markets\nor the news or the market makers or the indicators I was using, but the problem was\nwithin myself.\nI couldn’t help but wonder if it was my fault, if I was a complete dumb ass, or if the\nuniverse was against me making money? I was investing a lot of time and resources on\nthis crazy adventure and the results were so horribly bad. I am so glad I wasn’t married\nat that time, or had a family. The pressure would have been enormous.\n \nI know, this sounds close to the saddest story you’ve ever read, but I also know it’s the\nstory of many people around who are seduced by the idea of working from home, by\nthemselves, and earning extra fat income every month. Well, you know, in theory it’s\npossible. The market is there, a lot of money changes hands all the time, and there is an\nendless stream of possibility.\n \nYou could potentially become super wealthy in a few months if you could just win all\nthe time and leverage your account like crazy.\n \nMoney moving in the billions from one place to another, huge amounts of leverage, a\nvast market with all the volatility of which anyone could dream, and there’s even people\nout there making a crazy good living out of it, really.\n \nSo, I thought, If some people do it, or at least claim to do it. Then why can’t I? Or, why\ncan’t you?\n \nIt took me years to answer this question. And, basically, the most accurate answer I have\nis:\n \nWe are asking the wrong questions to the wrong people.\nFor example, all these “signal providers,” how is it possible that they claim to have\nsuch amazing results, but when you try to use the signals yourself somehow it’s nearly\nimpossible to achieve the same results they do. I don’t know if it were me, but I was\nalways too late or too early, or when I finally entered at the right moment suddenly I\ntake this massive loss, and they tell you “well it’s one loss after so much winning” only\nI never got to the “so much winning” part. \n \nOr, all this “proven systems” that show massive trading records, it seems so easy,\nalmost foolish not to become a millionaire in a few months, or even weeks!\n \nOr, look at the “custom” indicators or Expert Advisors. I don’t know if you’ve ever\ntried them, but somehow in real life they seem much more discretionary and hard to\ninterpret than when you see those beautiful charts with the “model trades” where\neverything seems easy and clear. It’s like you can almost feel your success, but\nsomehow it never comes.\n \nBut you might know that trading is a zero sum game. It means that if someone is losing\nthere, it means that there is some other person winning on the other side. That means that\nsomeone is actually winning! … But who? … Or how do they actually do it?\nA \nSTRANGE\n \nMEETING\n, \nA\n \nSTRANGE\n \nMAN\n, \nAND\n \nSOME\nWINE\n \nSo, at this point: my original $60,000 dollar account, which I filled with my life\nsavings, was close to $9,000. Yes, I’ve lost more than 80% of my trading capital in over\na year because of my bad trading. That was money I was saving for over 10 years, so it\nwas truly painful to see day by day how my dreams were evaporating, and the harder I\ntried the faster money was leaving my account.\n \nAt that time I was really struggling with my life, I was deep in to debt with my credit\ncards, car payments, rent, etc., and my day job was not really giving me enough money\nto meet my everyday needs. My girlfriend, now wife was still studying, so I really had\nto pay for most of the family expenses. \n \nAt some point I was about to withdraw the $9,000 I still had, take my losses, and at\nleast pay off one of my credit cards and forget about this crazy trading adventure. This\nmaybe would have been the most conservative and reasonable thing to do. But\nsomething happened during those days that changed my life.\n \nIn my former job I had to travel quite a bit, very extenuating working trips that drove me\naway from home for a few hours to a couple of days.\n \nAnyway, back then, I was coming out from a meeting in Napa Valley, California, in an\nupscale hotel, and decided to sit at the bar. I ordered a sandwich; I had a couple of\nhours before the cab will pick me up and drive me back to the airport.\nA few tables awa\ny\n was this older guy drinking a bottle of wine all by himself. I will not\ntell his real name because he is retired from the business. But we will call him Robert.\nRobert says hi to me, and we start chatting, separated from each other by a few tables.\nFinally he asks me to go over his table and invited me for a glass of wine.\n \nHe seemed a wealthy man and, as he told me back then, he was just enjoying retirement\nand traveling around wine countries and playing golf. He, like myself, is a big fan of red\nwine. So, our conversation was around that subject, and we had quite a good time\ntogether.\n \nRobert told me that he spent most of his working years at the Deutsche Bank, which to\nme sounded so boring that I didn’t really ask for any details. I felt my life was so much\nmore exciting that some guy behind a desk at a bank. At the end, we did exchange email\naddresses and because we both liked red wine, we decided to keep in touch.\n \nI went back home and at some point I happened to try one of the amazing wines from\nMexico, I don’t know if you ever tried them, but they have amazing wine down there.\nSo, I wrote Robert and sent him a picture of Monte Xanic wine’s tab.\n \nHe replied telling me that he knew everything about that wine and how much he liked it,\ntoo. But the amazing part was the signature on his email:\n \nRobert XXXXXX\n \nDB Forex/Futures\nSenior Trading Desk Director\n \nWhen he told me he worked at the DB I, never thought he’d work in this specific area of\nthe bank!\n \nSo I decided to write him an email asking to clarify. He wrote back saying he was over\n35 years in the Forex/Futures business as a trader.\n \nThat same night I wrote back telling him about all my trading frustrations, how things\nwere so bad for me in those years, all the pain I had to endure, all the money I’ve lost,\nall the silly strategies I’ve tried, all the books I’ve read, and internet rubbish I bought,\netc.\n \nAfter this letter we spoke on the phone several times and, at the end, thank God for that,\nhe agreed to mentor me for two weeks one on one and then to keep in touch with me for\na few months every day, so I could really understand how to trade. He asked me to\ncommit full time to this task and he agreed to show me everything he knew about\ntrading.\n \nFor this commitment I had to give him a $6,000 token and a box of Monte Xanic wine.\nAs you know, I didn’t really have that money at the time but I didn’t think about it twice,\nI went to the bank and asked for a loan (another loan on top of my credit cards and car\npayments), deposited this money to Robert, and shipped the wine bottles. A few weeks\nlater my training started.\n \n“You know, Paul, trading is not really what you read about in those books,” he told me,\nand I found out he was right. Actually, after those mentoring weeks, I finally understood\nhow especially the brokers and market makers rig everything against the retail trader.\nThey have made a whole industry after the Internet was available and everyone could\ntrade from home. Their industry is basically based on our bad trading. Try to go to any\nof the “educational” sections of the brokers and use their strategies, I’d be really\nsurprised if you could win a buck with them. Or why do you think they give you 5 or\neven 1-second charts?\n \nWho could trade with that?\n \nForex trading was not really conceived for individuals. It’s a market for huge financial\nwhales. But if you understand how those whales move their enormous capital, you can\nride on their backs and make a lot of money. Well, a lot of money for you and me, for\nthem is just like “small rounding errors.”\n \nThe most fascinating part is that Robert taught me a way to approach the markets that\nworked for him for over 35 years, so it was not some fancy new thing that will stop\nworking any moment the market changes.\n \nSo after a few months of demo trading, slowly moving to real money, hard work, and\nsome shouting from Robert, who couldn’t understand how I got to such a bad point, with\nso many bad trading habits, my account finally began to take off. I began making a few\nhundred dollars a week. I remember my first winning week was like +$134. But this\nnumber started to grow slowly but steadily.\n \nBefore I knew, I was already making 4 figures a week. My original $60,000 came back\nto my account in only 20 months. I was trading a bit too leveraged, I must say, but I\nneeded desperately to feel I could stand up again and make some money out of all this.\nIn the third year I was already making a 6-figure income from my trading. So yes, I can\ntell you, it’s possible to trade profitably. It is possible to start with a modest account\nand trade your way up to a 6- or even a 7-figure return. I will not say it’s easy; it’s\nactually quite difficult, especially because your biggest enemy in this war is not the\nother traders or the big banks or even the brokers, it is yourself. On the other hand, the\nchanges you need to start to make real money are also at your reach.\n \nBecause everything depends on you.\nT\nHE\n \nINFAMOUS\n AHA \nMOMENT\n \n \nIn all the materials I’ve read before Robert’s mentoring, there was all this rubbish about\nthe “aha” moment, some sort of a revelation moment where you will understand\neverything that was bad in your trading and change your life, instantly.\n \nWell, at some point I remember asking myself, “am I an idiot?” Or, why don’t I get any\na-ha magical moment? Even though I study so hard, and even lose so much money trying\nto trade profitably.\n \nI can tell you I didn’t have this “aha” moment, that I’ve read so much about. It was more\nlike a series of small “aha…” tiny moments. Trading is a very complex and multi\nvariable task. That’s why it can be difficult without the proper training or guidance.\n \nAt some point I started to follow my own system flawlessly and without any fear or\nhesitation.\n \nMonth after month, the numbers started to work in my favor. I wasn’t doing any special\nthing, or at least I thought I wasn’t, but trading became some sort of a second nature.\n \nI know quite a bit about markets by now, and Forex currency pairs started to unfold\nbefore my eyes and I became pretty good at predicting price movements. I thought at the\ntime; but I wasn’t really predicting I was just implementing a system with an edge that,\nin the long run, was giving me positive results. I know it sounds complicated, but in real\nlife the system is actually the easiest part.\nHowever it’s important to notice that, even now, every time I get a losing trade I have\nthis strange feeling of “maybe my system is not working anymore”, “maybe I should start\nto look for a new one”, even after years and hundreds of profitable trades. So my\nlearning here is that: at least for me, I have to be disciplined in my approach on trading\nand always follow my rules. There is no magic to it, simply a good method.\nT\nHE\n R\nIGHT\n M\nENTAL\n F\nRAMING\n (\nOR\n, \nWHY\n \nTRADERS\nDON\n’\nT\n \nMAKE\n \nMONEY\n)\n \nWhen I first open my real trading account with $60,000 (only to lose over $51,000 some\nmonths later), I was so proud of all that money.\n \nFor me to have all that cash just to trade was a bit of a huge self-accomplishment. Apart\nfrom that, I had another $7,000 in my savings account. So the $60k was basically all my\nlife savings.\n \nI had earned the money with huge effort, working for many years on my business and in\nday jobs. So, I was quite attached to that money … such a nice round number.\n \nBy that time, I already blew up a few real trading accounts, with some at $500 even one\nwith $2,000. It was painful, but not such a big deal, because it was just “play” money\nbecause I haven’t decided to put the bulk of my money to trade.\n \nOne of this failed accounts had a couple hundred left and I was trying a “new strategy.”\nAnd, for a few weeks already, I found myself using this system that “was so good,” and\nhelping me so much, that I’ve already doubled the $200 and was sitting at $400 in only\ntwo weeks.\n \nFor me, this little two weeks’ success was enough proof that I was ready to trade “for\nreal.” So, I deposited the $60,000 and I was ready to make a fortune in the markets.\nI saw myself already in the very near future buying new houses, cars; traveling around\nthe world ... what could go wrong? my “system” was infallible.\n \nWith the small account, I was using the maximum 100:1 leverage at that time, so I\ndecided to take it easy and trade the $60,000 with a 2:1 ($120,000) lots.\n \nI would be risking very little and maybe I will double my account every 6 months, or so\nI thought in my “easy accounting” mind. Boy, was I wrong.\n \nBut why!?? I was already doing it on my tiny $200 (now $400) account. I mean, I’ve\nread all those books about trading, and how to cut your losses and let your winners run,\netc. I even bought this “Amazing” Meta Trader system that was giving me “very\naccurate” signals.\n \nYeah, sure… but.\n \nAfter only 6 months, my account was in the lower $50,000’s. Let alone doubling it, I\nwas consistently and slowly losing money every week, like a car leaking oil.\n \nExactly what was happening? Ok, I\n’\nl\nl\n tell you with one typical example from those\ndays:\n \nMy Amazing System Indicator was telling me BUY EUR/GBP, so that’s what I did, I\nplace a trade to buy a $120k lot, but after a few minutes my trade is on the red 10 pips.\nWith a $120k lot, that is minus $120 dollars...\nI mean, for me that was some good money. I could gas the tank of my car a couple of\ntimes, or take my girlfriend to the movies and then to dinner. That was hard, I didn’t\nwant to be losing $120, so I say ok: I need to wait, because my stop loss is at 30 pips\n(according to the Amazing System rules), so now I am waiting; every minute starts to\npass slowly, very slowly.\n \nMy eyes are fixed on the screen, the candles moving randomly. And the price is still\nmoving against me, no rebound, no retrace, only a steady bigger and bigger move\nagainst me.\n \nSuddenly I am in the -$300 area. That was enough money for a short weekend vacation!!\nMan, this is painful. So I just can’t stand it anymore. I am supposed to cut my loses\nshort. So I finally close the trade at a loss.\n \nNow I can see those horrible -$327.45 (after a very bad execution from my broker and\ncommissions expenses). And I think to myself, “ok, it was bad, but you have to learn to\ntake loses, it’s part of trading.” I feel very bad about it, but I just try to be very strong\nand not let my emotions take control. I can tell you now that they were very much\nalready in control by that moment and almost from the first day I began trading.\n \nI go to the kitchen for a cup of coffee and come back after twenty minutes only to see the\nprice went back to my entry price. So If I had stayed in the trade, now I’d be -$0. But\nnot only that, times passes and now I see the screen in horror.\n \nPrice is going now up, more and more! If I had stayed, now I’d have +$230. Wait! Now\n+$315, +$456 … wow, that is really painful.\nBut wait!, there is always a second chance to redeem yourself: my “Amazing System” is\ntelling me SELL USD/JPY. Ok cool. This time it will be different.\n \nNow I’ll make some serious money because this time I know better how to trade.\n \nBut look, maybe I was too crazy to bet with such a large amount last time. I mean $120k\nis a lot of money! I’d play it slowly now; I’d enter only a $60k lot this time.\n \nVery good, so USD/JPY very quickly moves in my favor, it is minus a few pips now …\nbig spike to the downside! Cool!! +20 pips for me! That’s +$120!! (Remember I am\nnow only with $60k lot) very cool. Maybe with some luck I’ll recover from my last\nloss, maybe I’ll make some money this time.\n \nBut wait, price is moving up again … it came back up a little, so now it’s only +15 pips\nor +$90 … ok, what to do. I mean $90 is quite a good amount of money.\n \nI could just take a few good trades like this one and I will be good for the week. Ok I’ll\ncut it now! Closed trade +$84.77 (yes, another horrible execution from my broker), but I\ngot some money back! Thanks God! Maybe not all, but at least I made it less painful.\nMaybe I am really meant to be a great trader, I greet myself.\n \nI check some emails, read some Facebook jokes, call my girlfriend. Come back a few\nhours later, and … yes, I see that price has collapsed. It’s like minus 65 pips from my\nentry point. Man!! I just had to wait, I start telling myself.\n \nAnd why did I enter with half a position anyway? I mean, I could be winning $780 at\nthis very moment!, if I would have been a little smarter, and follow the strategy I was\nplaying, both trades could have been profitable and I would have earned $1,500!; but\nyou know what?\n \nI am actually in the minus $250 by now. That’s awfully painful.\n \nIt took me so many losses, systems, tries, signal services, books, indicators, etc., to\nrealize I wasn’\nt\n really struggling with the markets, but actually I was struggling with\nmyself on every trade.\n \nAnd my mind was constantly playing against me. Maybe the trade was right, maybe the\nsystem was good (it wasn’t, I found about how to test systems later), but I wasn’t even\ntrading the system, or executing the trades in a proper way.\n \nI was looking at the money I was losing and gaining from a totally wrong and very\ndamaging perspective. I was so attached to the cash I had that I couldn’t bare to watch it\ngo down or even up! Fear and greed were part of my decision-making process. Of\ncourse, it was impossible to win any money like this.\n \nAt some point, when I was in the minus $48,800 area, I realized I had to make peace\nwith the market. I mean, by that time frustration was so big, I couldn’t think of working\nmy ass in my business again to put back $48,800 in my account only to lose it again.\nEarning it back with my trading appeared really impossible now.\n \nWhen I was saving that money, originally, I was planning to buy a flat, at least to put a\nnice down payment for that purpose. Now I didn’t have the money, nor the flat. And I\nwas still renting this stupid house.\nBecause of my positive nature, I always tried to look at it like everything will be OK in\nthe end. But this time I was at my breaking point. I felt like I was trapped and ready to\ngive up.\n \nI went for a work trip to Buenos Aires and decided to stay there for one more week,\nonly to think of what was happening, far away from my trading station. Of course, my\ngirlfriend was not happy about me just hanging alone there, but I felt already too\nembarrassed to face the situation and tell her the real reason why I couldn’t just go back\nto my routine of losing money.\n \nI had to understand that: first it’s not personal and second: it’s impossible to predict\nwhat is going to happen in the markets. So, basically, ANYTHING could happen; and it\ndoes, it really does.\n \nHow is it even possible to make money in such a treacherous environment? Is it\npossible at all? I can tell you: It is. It’s basically a game of probability; like flipping a\ncoin.\n \nLet’s look at this example: if you toss a coin for a few times you will not get a 50-50%\nprobability to heads and tails. You would really need to toss it like 1,000 times to get\nsome real accurate 50 - 50%, but imagine you set yourself the goal to toss it 1,000\ntimes.\n \nBut, every time you are about to toss the coin, you hesitate. And, ask yourself: should I\nmaybe not toss it this time? I think I am not using the right coin; I should try with this\nother coin. Stop it with your hand? Or let it go all the way to the ground? Or once the\ncoin is in the air, you just change your mind about tossing it and grab it quickly from the\nair and put it back to your pocket.\n \nThat’s the way most people trade. Instead of focusing on finding a good and profitable\nsystem, and then commit to apply it flawlessly every single time, they focus on every\nsingle trade, as if one trade was so important. Of course when they have three or four\nlosing trades in a row, they simply quit and start looking for another system, they think\nthe system is not working anymore, or they start over tweaking and trying to find\nrelationships between facts that are not really connected.\n \nI mean, I understand all those people very well! I was exactly like this, and I’ve lost\nsuch a horrendous amount of money because of that. When you are in the middle of a\nwinning trade, it’s so difficult just to wait until you reach your target, especially because\nmany times you won’t ever reach it, and then you will feel so miserable because at some\npoint you were in profit. Or, sometimes your stop will be hit almost to the pip, and then\nthe market will start moving in your direction for a crazy amount of pips; only this time,\nyou were already stopped out from the trade. That’s why so many people blame the\nbrokers for “stops hunting\n”\n.\nT\nO\n \nDEMO\n \nOR\n \nNOT\n \nTO\n \nDEMO\n \n \nIn my mentoring time, we were only doing demo trading. If you don’t have a demo\naccount, go now and open one, I\n’l\nl wait for you right here, just place the amount of\nmoney that you are planning to open your real trading account with … ok, is it open\nnow? Sure? Not yet? Not a problem I\n’l\nl wait a little longer till you really open it …\nready? OK great!\n \nDemo trading is very important because you will have plenty of time and infinite virtual\nmoney to lose in the time it takes you to learn to follow a system. One of the biggest\ndisadvantages of demo is that you won’t be learning to control your emotional regarding\nmoney, because we all know these are only fake dollars, or euros, or pounds. But, it’s\ncrucial to start there. Also, the brokers will give you great executions no matter what,\nbecause liquidity is infinite in the virtual money world. But, don’t let that discourage\nyou to start with a demo account, it’s crucial to your success as a trader.\n \nAfter you have been trading successfully for 4 - 6 months in this account, you are ready\nto put real money on the line, you will have enough confidence in your system and in\nyourself to stand a few losing trades, or you won’t go crazy if suddenly you have a nice\nstreak of winning trades.\n \nLook, I know we all want instant results, and become wealthy before the end of the\nmonth. But the Forex markets are not the lottery, so if you really are serious about your\ntrading, you should not skip this rule.\nI was so afraid to lose more money that what I decided after the 6 months of mentoring\nand demo trading successfully was to let alone my “real” account that was standing at\nsome $9k and start trading with one of my old accounts that had some $100 that I could\nbarely trade because the margin was so tight. The great thing about that tiny account is\nthat I didn’t really care about the money, only the system, because it wouldn’t have hurt\nmuch to lose $100. So, my mind was focused on executing the strategy right to see how\nit worked with real money, even if it was such a tiny amount.\n \nAfter only a few weeks my account was in the $200’s, so I decided I’d deposit from my\n“big” account another $200, so I had $400 to trade. Then, when I was at $800, I moved\nanother $800 from the big account. And so I did until I depleted my old account. It was a\nrenovating process. It didn’t last very long, a few months. But it completely drove my\nmind from the money-worrying problem I had. Because I always had a 50% cushion I\ncould lose and still be the same as I was before my last deposit. And, also because for a\nwhile I was worrying to gain and lose only a few bucks, so it wasn’t really worrying at\nall.\n \nIf you are hurt from past horrible trading history like I was, you can try my strategy,\nstarting with only a few hundreds and deposit more once you get to a certain threshold,\nbut only after you have demo for a while and feel confident about your system.\nW\nHY\n \nTRADE\n \nTHE\n F\nOREX\n \nMARKETS\n?\n \n \nThe Forex markets are a huge, highly liquid, and decentralized market. What does that\nmean? It means there is not an exchange (like in the stock market) or any single\ninstitution that is responsible for what and how it is traded. It’s an enormous Over the\nCounter market where banks and other big institutions just trade currency pairs for the\nprice that \n\"\nseem\ns\n” right to the market. In other words, they sell to the highest bidder\nand buy from the lowest offer.\n \nCompared to the apparently large $22.4 billion a day volume of the New York Stock\nExchange, the foreign exchange market becomes absolutely enormous with its $5\nTRILLION a day trade volume. That gives you a great advantage when trying to fill a\ntrade, there will be enough liquidity to fill even big positions instantly, no matter if you\nwant to go short or long.\n \nBecause it’s mostly unregulated, it has many great qualities. For example, the barrier to\nentry is basically nonexistent. You can open a Forex account with a few dollars, some\nbrokers will let you open it with as little as $20. Compare that with the minimum\n$25,000 you need to day trade in the stock exchange markets.\n \nAlthough the U.S. government has enforced leverage rules (maximum 50:1 in Majors)\nand some other nonsense, like the FIFO rule (some regulation that forces you to close\nyour positions beginning from your oldest position to your newest, if you have many in\nthe same pair), the world is full of brokers who will give you massive leverage, even\n1,000:1 (not that anyone should trade with such a crazy amount of leverage), allow you\nhedging, don’t care what position you close or open first, or let you withdraw and\ndeposit your money via Paypal or Moneybookers or even Bitcoin.\nOf course, with all this freedom there is the chance to find yourself with very bad and\ndishonest people who are only trying to part you from your money (everyone is but it’s\nfair if it’s within the rules because that way you are allowed to take other traders money,\ntoo). But, with a bit of research, you can find a reputable broker that is regulated in it’s\ncountry of origin, has good reviews, and has decent spreads and/or commissions. Just\nwork a little and put the effort to find the right one for you.\n \nBecause of it’s global use, the Forex market is open 24 hours a day from, Monday\nmorning in New Zealand to Friday afternoon in NY. So, you don’t depend on business\nhours and you can adapt your trading to your sleeping habits, your time zone, and, most\nof all, you will not wake up the next morning to find huge gaps in the after-hours markets\n– like in the equities markets where it’s so common, because your stops and take profits\nwill be in place working also 24 hours a day.\n \nThere is no middle man, less commissions, less cost of trading, all of this because the\nbrokers normally use electronic instant filing systems and deal directly with liquidity\nproviders like big banks, they can give you crazy cheap transaction costs compared with\nother markets like the futures market or the stock exchanges. For only a few dollars’\nworth of spread, you can trade in the tenths, hundreds of thousands, or even millions,\nmaking use of leverage and low trading costs.\n \nLeverage is a way to trade the markets effectively without having big accounts. You\nknow that currency exchange rates move in such a small fractions of points that to make\nmoney trading, let’s say buying $1,000 of EUR/USD at 1.1294 and then sell it to 1.1344,\na sad $5 bucks win, minus spread and commissions.\n \nSo, the brokers came with the solution of lending you the ability to enter a position\nbigger than what you have to a ratio of your choice. Depending on the broker, it can be\n50:1, 100:1, 400:1, and more. So, your original $1,000 could control $100,000 in a\n100:1 account; in that case, instead of your $5 winning trade you would be sitting in a\n$500 win, making a 50% winning on your capital in a single small trade.\n \nOf course, leverage works both ways, so it must be used wisely and conservatively, it\nshould always be another component of your strategy. Consider that if your account\nallows you a maximum 100:1 leverage, it doesn’t mean that you need to trade using all\nof the leverage, or even most of it. Sometimes 2:1 or 5:1 is more than enough to make\ngood money.\n \nWhen I was first starting to trade, I was looking for the button to lower the leverage,\nbecause I’ve read somewhere that it was dangerous to trade with too much leverage,\nand found I could only lower it to a minimum of 50:1 in my brokerage account. I was\nquite angry and even contacted customer support about this issue. Somehow I didn’t see\nthat I could just enter a smaller position and disregard of my maximum leverage setting.\nIt’s basic, but can confuse novice traders.\n \nIf you ever traded penny stocks, you know there is always the possibility of some big\npockets to corner the particular stock you are trading. They could literally take it to the\nmoon and then make it crash to the ground willingly, and if you are in the wrong side\nyou can get really hurt. The Forex markets can’t be cornered because they are so\nenormous; however, Central Banks and some other government institutions can\nintroduce wild volatility effects, so be careful when big news come out. However, a\ncurrency, especially a major one, can never go to zero, or lose 95% of it’s value, like\nmany companies do on a regular basis.\nW\nHAT\n \nYOU\n MUST \nKNOW\n \nTO\n \nTRADE\n \nThese are very basic technical concepts. If you are reading this book, I am sure you are\nfamiliar with them. Just take a quick glance so we know we are speaking about the same\nconcepts when we talk about specific strategies later in the book.\n \nMy strategies are not constructed around complicated indicators or many technical\ntools, just the very basic and most powerful ones. I believe you don’t need to have a\n“spaghetti” chart to trade profitably; on the contrary, it will distract you from the price\naction and give you mostly irrelevant information, trying to make sense from simple and\nplain noise.\nT\nRENDS\n \nAND\n \nRANGES\n \n \nMarkets can only do two things: range bound or trend. That means that whether they are\ntrapped in a smaller zone going up and down without breaking this zone, or they can\ntrend, meaning they go constantly in the same direction, further and further: higher and\nhigher or lower and lower.\n \nHowever, markets don’t go in a straight line. They tend to move a bit in one direction\nthen retrace and then a bit further, then abruptly in one direction, then pause again,\nretrace a bit, and so on. Sometimes the movement can seem random, but if you see it\nfrom a longer time frame, things can get much clearer.\n \nA Bullish trend is when the market goes higher and higher, making higher highs and\nhigher lows.\nA Bearish trend is when the market goes lower and lower, making lower highs and\nlower lows.\nS\nUPPORT\n \nAND\n R\nESISTANCE\n \nSupport is a horizontal line, the “floor” where price action appears to stop and rebound\nhigher or stay around it for some time without crossing it in a definitive way, making it a\npsychological barrier for traders. Thus it is something significant when it’s finally\nbroken.\n \n \n \n \nResistance is a horizontal line, the “roof” where price action appears to stop and\nrebound lower or stay around it for some time without crossing it in a definitive way,\nmaking it a psychological barrier for traders. Thus it is something significant when it’s\nfinally broken.\nWhen a Support zone is finally broken and price moves definitely lower, this former\nsupport normally becomes resistance.\n \nWhen a Resistance zone is finally broken and price moves definitely higher, this former\nresistance normally becomes support.\n \nDon’t worry if you don’t know exactly where to place support and resistance, every\ntrader place them a bit different, they should be taken more like zones than exact points.\nIn all my trading strategies, I never plot support and resistance in lower time frames; the\nmost useful are daily and weekly, they are the most significant and thus the easier to use\nfor technical trading.\n \nTo plot resistance in a 1-hour chart or 4-hour chart, in my opinion, is useless because\nthe bigger money (banks, hedge funds) don’t move real money in the lower time frames,\nand they are the ones really making and affecting the markets.\nOK, here’s why you started reading the book in the first place…\nL\nET\n’\nS\n \nTALK\n \nABOUT\n \nSTRATEGIES\n \n \nI developed the strategies described in this book after several months of coaching and\ntesting. They are statistically solid and can bring great results, depending on how deeply\nyou understand them and how well you execute them. That doesn’t mean they will\nalways give you winning trades or that you will have a 100% rate of success using\nthem. You are welcome to use them as they are or to adapt them to your own trading\nstyle.\n \nI wanted to show you sample ideas for different types of trading, depending on your\npersonality, your current situation, and how much you want to be involved in the\nmarkets. They should be seen as a starting point for you to develop your own strategy\nthat suits you better. There is no one strategy that will serve everyone because all of us\nhave different needs and expectations.\n \nThe idea is to prove that a winning strategy by no means has to be complicated or hard\nto understand. On the contrary, I believe that a good strategy should be simple and have\nas little parameters as possible to make it effective, easy to focus, and easy to measure.\n \nIf you keep a trading journal, after every single trade you make you will be able to\nachieve much better results in the long term, and also understand better what’s working,\nwhat’s not working, and how to avoid mistakes.\n \nIf you want to download a .xls file with the parameters to keep a journal, you can\ndownload one at my blog post \nhttp://www.forexlife.me/?p=100\n in there you will find a\nlink for the download.\nP\nOSITION\n \nTRADING\n S\nTRATEGY\n “B\nIG\n B\nULLS\n \nAND\nB\nEARS\n”\n \n \nIf you are a person who doesn’t have the time to keep watching the screen all day, or\nwho wants to focus on other things in life, or maybe psychologically it’s too hard for\nyou to just look at the market all time (like happened to me many times), I’ll show you a\nvery simple strategy that will allow you to collect income in a very regular and simple\nway.\n \nWith this strategy, you will not have a lot of trades, maybe one or two every month, but a\nbig number of them will be profitable and they will allow you to collect a nice stream\nof income.\n \nStep 1: Check the markets EVERY weekend, in a WEEKLY CHART, you have plenty of\ntime after the market is closed on Friday afternoon, but you need to do it before the\nmarket reopens on Monday, or Sunday, depending on your time zone.\n \nStep 2: You will look for this candlestick formations, and this formation ONLY in any\npairs you want to trade, I wouldn’t limit myself here, the more the merrier. Just try to\navoid the big spread pairs:\n \nEngulfing Candles\n - an engulfing candle looks basically like this:\nPlease note that the high and the low of the last candle are higher than the high and the\nlow of the previous candle, if they are the same height at either one of the extremes, they\nare not valid engulfing candles.\n \nBullish Engulfing Candles: These are candles that close higher than they open, and they\nshow high amount of bullish power. They are a possible signal to go long.\n \nBearish engulfing: These are candles that close lower than they open, and they show\nhigh amount of bearish power. They are a possible signal to go short.\n \nStep 3: Look for important areas of resistance and support or continuation movements in\ncase the trend is very clear.\n \nStep 4: Place your stop at the top or bottom of the engulfing candle, depending if it’s a\nlong or short trade.\n \nStep 5: Depending on the distance from the entry to the stop, you will determine your\nrisk, thus your position size. If you have a 200 pips distance to the stop loss and you are\nrisking, let’s say, $400 per trade, your position size should be $20,000.\nStep 6: Place your stop entry a few pips above or below the high or the low of the\nengulfing candle, depending if it’s a bullish or a bearish trade.\n \nStep 7: Move to break even after the price has gone 50% of the size of the engulfing bar\nin your direction, in this example: 100 pips.\n \nStep 8: For the quickest and safest profit, exit after a 150% move of the size of the\ncandle in your direction, i.e., 300 pips. Another option will be to keep trailing every\n100 pips to increase your Risk-to-Reward Ratio. Yet another option is to find support\nand resistance levels and trail according to those lines. There’s no right or wrong way\nto do it, just different possibilities for your personal taste and objectives.\n \nIf you trail, you will have some frustrating break evens, but you will also hit crazy home\nruns, like a huge EUR/JPY movement I was able to trade for over 1,200 pips a few\nmonths ago. If you don’t trail and go directly for the 150% target price, you will have a\nbigger amount of winning trades, but in smaller profit sizes each.\n \nI will put a few sample trades, although they’re trades I did take and made money, I will\ncherry pick them to show you how they should look. It doesn’t mean that every trade I\npicked was a massive winner, but I think after watching these trades you will be able to\ntake a look at the charts and find some for yourself and even back test easily with\ndifferent position sizing and trailing or target methods you might plan to use, and thus\nfine tune your own strategy to your liking.\n \nHere’s an example from EUR/GBP last week of October 2013\nHere’s how this trade unfolded:\n \n \nDepending on your particular strategy you could have ride this enormous trend or\nsimply make your 150% profit; maybe breakeven or something in between, but this\nsample demonstrates the power of these setups to anticipate long trends.\nHere’s an example from the USD/CAD on the third week of July 2012\n \n \n \nThis is a clear continuation trend trade, we can see that the support / resistance line has\nbecome one or the other several times. However we see a clear sign (our Bearish\nEngulfing Candle) to go short on this important area.\n \nThe same trade setup, a little closer.\nThis is how the trade unfolded:\nThis trade had a big potential for trailing and capture a good part of the move.\nHere’s another trade\n \nThis a EUR/JPY chart from a trade I did December 2014. As you can see, the Relevant\nResistance was way back in 2008 and 2007; that’s why the chart has so much zoom\nback. However, when prices are reaching new highs all the time, you have to go back\nmany years to see how prices was reacting back then at those levels. It’s amazing how\nthey are still valid even so many years later. \n \n \n \nHere’s a view of the setup in a closer look, and how it unfolds:\nThis is what we pray for in this strategy, a clean 1,200 pips move, in only 6 weeks! It\nwas a nice way to start 2015.\n \nAs you can see, these trades can span from a few weeks to several months, but there are\nalways some good opportunities out there to enter more trades, I normally don’t limit\nmyself to only one single trade at the time, but divide my risk to be able to trade two or\neven three trades at the same time.\n \nIt’s important to consider that if you, for example, are already in a USD/JPY trade, to\nenter another USD or JPY related trade will be like doubling your risk in the same\ntrade. Although they will not move in the exact same fashion, they will be correlated\nand mostly have the same overall movement.\nA S\nWING\n T\nRADING\n S\nTRATEGY\n \n \nThe strategy we will use for Swing Trading is quite similar to the Position Trading, we\nwill be looking for the same pattern on the daily charts (Engulfing Candles). Although\nwith a few particularities:\n \nWe will only enter trades in the direction of the overall trend in the daily chart, at\nrelevant support and resistance levels. If the trend is not clear, we can enter in a range\ntrade at either side of the range.\n \nWe will normally wait for a retracement of the main direction to enter the trades in the\ndirection of the trend. Or when a relevant support and resistance level is broken with an\nEngulfing Candle.\n \nPlace a pending order 4 - 6 pips above or below the bullish or bearish candle. Place the\nstop order above or below the engulfing candle.\n \nMove to break even after the next minor resistance or support is passed.\n \nTrail every three candles or target a relevant support or resistance.\n \nThis strategy will normally give you a 1 - 3 trades a week, it’s very important that you\ncheck the markets every day after the NY session is over, also try to look for a broker\nwho gives you NY closing charts. Although there’s is not an official session for the\nForex markets, NY closing charts will put you closer to what professional futures\ntraders view.\n \nYou can trade all the pairs that you like, just try to avoid the big spread pairs; they will\nwork too (I mean USD/TRY or EUR/NOK, or similar) but you will pay a higher price\nfor trading them.\n \nEUR/CAD Trade from February 2015\n \n \nHere we have a tight range and a big Bearish Engulfing Candle at one of the extremes.\nAlthough we could have entered a stop sell order a few pips bellow our bearish candle\nfor the next session, and place our stop above the high of the Bearish Engulfing Candle.\n \nThis is how the trade unfolded:\nDepending on your exit strategy you could have banked between 200 and 600 pips in\ntwo or three weeks.\n \nHere’s an example of a trade in the NZD/JPY from February 2014\nAs you can see there was a clear uptrend (higher highs and higher lows) that retraced to\nan important support level and it was there when the Bullish Engulfing Candle formed,\nwhich gave us the clue that the trend will continue it’s course. This is how the trade\nunfolded:\nNext is an example of the USD/CAD from July 2012, as you can see the downtrend was\nstarting to resume it’s move and we’ve got a Big Bearish Engulfing Candle right at the\nrelevant Support that was broken and thus became resistance.\nOnce again, the bearish engulfing candle was the beginning of a nice move that drove\nthe markets for more than 400 pips. Of course it’s hard to catch the entire swing, but\ndisregard of your exit strategy, most likely you would have been able to harvest quite a\nfew pips from this trade, if you’d have been there to trade it.\nA S\nCALPING\n S\nTRATEGY\n \n \nScalping is a trading technique focused on going in and out of the markets in periods of\na few minutes to a few hours. It’s the most intensive, time consuming, and mentally\nchallenging environment for trading.\n \nI wouldn’t recommend that you scalp unless you already have significant experience and\nsuccess trading the longer timeframes. You will be tested to the limit in this kind of\ntrading and if you go directly to scalp without proper preparation and training, very\nlikely you will lose a lot of money before you can become profitable. That’s why you\nshould start trading demo at first with this strategy even if you are already making\nmoney in the longer timeframes, until you feel comfortable and yo\nu\nhav\ne\n mastered the\nstrategy.\n \nIt’s also important to limit your leverage because you will be entering and exiting the\nmarkets very often and:\n \na) You can make mistakes (we all do)\n \nb) You will be making money from the bulk of your trades, they can add up in the month\nto 50 or even 100, so don’t focus on every trade but rather on implementing the strategy\ncorrectly.\n \nUsing a broker with low spreads and NO commission, a normal commission can be\naround $2.50 for every side. That means $5.00 for every trade per mini lot. If you make\n100 trades a month, you will need to earn an extra $500 only to break even for every\n$10k lot you trade. \n \nThe other caveat of this strategy is that you can only trade in the highest volatility times\nof the day. If you live in Canada, for example, the London open will be very late at night\nfor you, so maybe you wil\nl\n decide to trade only the NY open.\n \nThis is a trend following strategy, but we will wait for the retracements to enter only in\nthe direction of the daily trend. You can expect to have between 2 - 5 trades for every\npair every day. Although in rare occasions the setup could not appear for the whole\nsession. So patience is also a key element in this strategy.\n \nThe strategy seems a bit complicated at first, if detailed step by step, but make an effort\nto understand it overall and in the samples you’ll find below it will become much\nclearer.\nFor clarity sake, in the rules we will imply a bullish overall trend and a bullish trade,\nfor bearish markets you only need to invert the rules.\n \nCheck the news calendar. If you have a significant event this day, avoid the temptation\nand simply don’t trade two or three hours after and before the event. You can check into\nsites like fxstreet.com, the news calendar, only take in account the most important\nevents. In Fxstreet they are marked with a red “!!!” sign. In the NFP Friday it’s better not\nto trade at all.\n \nTrade only in the busiest hours of the day, London session and NY session.\n \nFind one to four pairs, the ones with the lowest spreads, normally the Majors\n(EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCAD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, GBPUSD). Start with one or two\npairs until you feel comfortable with the strategy.\n \nCheck the overall trend in the daily charts and only trade in that direction. If the pair\nlooks very choppy and it’s hard to define a range or a trend, it is better to change pairs.\n \nDraw horizontal lines in the main resistance and support areas in the daily chart.\n \nPlot a 20, 0 Bollinger band in a 5-minute candlestick chart. (Why Bollinger Bands?\nWell, they are standard in every trading platform, and basically what we need is a sign\nof the retracement to be ending, so it really could be Keltner channels or Fibos, Pivots,\nor whatever you feel more comfortable with, but I had good experience using the\nBollinger Bands)\n \nIf the overall trend is up, you will look for a setup to enter a long pending order when\nthe retracement has pierced the edge of the lower channel in the Bollinger Bands.\n \nIf the price is range bounding, wait for a breakout in from the range to start looking for\nsetups.\n \nWait for a bullish candle to appear and enter a pending long order if the price breaks\nthrough the last bullish candle high.\n \nIf price don’t hit your entry, wait for the next bullish candle after price has pierced the\nlower Bollinger Band line and enter a stop order again.\nPlace your stop above the significant low of the last few candles.\nMove to break even after 10 pips.\n \nLet it ride using the previous third bar low as a trailing stop, or alternatively you can\nexit when the price reaches a significant support or resistance.\n \nIn this strategy you could also go for a fix amount of pips like 10 or 20 pips. I’ve found\nthat 20 pips is a constant hit, so you could go for 20 pips if you don’t want to have so\nmany break even trades and increase your winning ratio to a very high level. Of course\nyou will miss the bigger swings.\n \nLike with all the strategies, you need to adapt your exits to your own trading needs and\npersonality.\n \nOk, so here’s a sample trade step by step to make it perfectly clear.\n \nHere’s a daily chart for the EUR/USD on March 31, 2015; the trend is clearly down in\nthe daily charts. So, we will start to look for bearish trades.\nNow we will see how the market is doing early in the morning 8:00 am NY time, right\nwhen the markets open.\nThis is a 5 minutes candlestick chart with a 20, 2 Bollinger Band indicator from early\nmorning of March 31, 2015.\n \nThe red vertical line is the session’s open. After this line we can see the price moving\nright into the upper channel line and above it. That’s where we start looking for a\nbearish candle. This candle comes right after the fourth bullish candle.  We can enter our\nentry stop (short order) and place our stop above this bearish candle.\nA candle later we are already in the trade. Let’s see how things unfolded.\n \n \nAs you can see there was a 40 pips move. Depending on our exit strategy we could have\ngot at least 10 pips or more.\n \nThis would be the next trade for the same day March 31, 2015. After our last trade we\nwait for the price to get back and pierce the upper Bollinger Band, When that happens\nwe wait for a bearish candle and place our stop short entry don’t forget to place your\nstop above this bearish candle\n.\n \n \nRight after we entered our pending order the trade triggers and we are in again.\n \nAs you can see, prices move for at least 20 pips in our favor before any significant\nretrace.\nIf you just open a chart from today or yesterday or the day before and look for the setup,\nmost likely you will find valid trades. Of course, not all of them are winners, but it’s a\nhigh probability, easy to follow setup for scalping. \n \nI seriously recommend to you, if you are willing to scalp, to first back test for at least a\nfew months and then, to try demo to see how you react to real time conditions before\ncommitting any money to this strategy.\n \nYou’ll need some practice to understand how the strategy works in different market\nconditions, please use your fake dollars for this practice.\nT\nHE\n U\nNEXPECTED\n “H\nOLY\n G\nRAIL\n”\nOF\n \nTRADING\n,\n \nOR\nHOW\n \nTO\n \nCALCULATE\n \nYOUR\n \nPOSITION\n \nSIZE\n \n \nPosition size is the single most crucial element in your trading, more than a correct entry\nor a correct stop. More than any strategy or self-psychological control ability, position\nsize can make or break your trading career. So don’t take it for granted because it is\ntruly the “holy grail” of trading.\n \nAfter trading for four to six months in the demo account, and keeping a detailed journal,\nyou should be able to know quite well the expectancy of your system.\n \nYou need to find out and have a clear knowledge about the following ratios:\n \nAverage Risk /Reward Ratio - How much you normally risk to win how much, this\nnumber is expressed as:\n1:1 if, for example to win 10 pips you risk 10 pips.\n \n2:1 could be that to win 50 pips you risk 25\n \n3:1 could be that to win 90 pips you risk 30\n \nAnd so on\n \n1:2 will be that you risk 40 pips to make 20 pips\nThe next important number to take into account is the percentage of winning trades. You\ncould be winning only 60% of your trades, or even 30%, and still be successful. So, to\nwin in the Forex markets it doesn’t mean that you win all the individual trades, maybe\neven lose most of them, and in some systems you can mostly lose in a per-trade basis\nand still be making a good amount of money.\n \nOnce you have your winning rate and your Average Risk / Reward Ratio, you can\ncalculate how big your position should be, depending on your risk tolerance, it has to be\na number that is coherent with your risk / reward ratio and your winning ratio.\n \nProfessional traders normally risk .5% to 1%, of course they manage bigger amounts of\nmoney. Most professional traders say that any account under $100k is not worth the time\nand effort.\n \nFor us, the retail traders, we may not have the luck to start with a $100k account, but the\nnice part is that we can build it up if we keep focus and are very disciplined, and take it\nall the way to $100k and more.\n \nSo, back to our calculations: Let’s say that you know that your system is right 60% of the\ntimes and your risk/reward is 2:1, meaning that you normally risk 20 pips to gain 40\npips. In other words, for every 100 trades, you will win in average 240 pips and lose\n80, leaving you with around 160 pips.\n \nNow let’s explore scenarios on how big your position size could be. Let’s say that you\nhave a $10,000 account. You decide to try with a risk of 1% per every trade. That will\nmean that 20 pips should account for 1% of your total account, in this case $100, so\nyour position size has to be $50,000. So normally you will risk 1%, or $100, to make\n$200. After a whole round of 100 trades, you should have gained $16,000 if you kept\nyour risk locked in 1% of $10,000.\n \nThanks to your demo trading journal, you’ll also know how long you will take to make\nthis 100 trades, so you can mostly know how much money you will make in a certain\namount of time. If, for example, you are scalping 50 trades a month, that will mean that\non average you will be making 8% of capital gains every month. Especially if you’re\nscalping, you should take into account commissions and spreads because they will\nimpact your account too. Luckily, you have your journal to find out what these numbers\nare.\n \nYou have to be aware that you could get a losing streak of a few trades in a row (in your\ndetailed journal you must figure out what was your worst losing streak and take it as a\nstandard possibility). If, for example, you had 6 losing trades in a row, that will leave\nyou suddenly with - 120 pips. Your position sizing should be sensible to this fact, so\nyour account doesn’t suffer a dramatic loss from a normal event in your system.\n \nIn the case of a $10,000 account and risk of 1%, you can find yourself with minus $600\nor $9,400, and, because of your 2:1 ratio, you can also know that with 3 winning trades\nyou will recoup your loses.   In the case of 1% to lose $600 from a $10k is not nice but\nfar from catastrophic.\n \nDepending on your expectancy rates and your personal tolerance to risk, you can tweak\nthis number to whatever suits you best. However, risking more than 5% in every trade is\nnormally considered dangerous. Let’s say you have this 6 losing trades in a row, or even\na 10-in-a-row event, that can maybe happen every 1 or 2 years in the normal life of your\nsystem. If you are risking 5%, or $500 in your $10,000 account, you will find yourself\nwith only $5,000, and loss of 50% of your capital. That starts to be catastrophic. On the\nother hand, if you’d be risking only 1%, you will sit in a -$1,000 loss. It will be tough to\nmake it back, but it shouldn’t be a problem after a few weeks of focused trading.\n \nYes, it sounds compelling to risk a big amount, especially if you are on a winning streak.\nYou could easily double your account in a few weeks, but take in account that your\nsystem also has losing streaks into which you will certainly fall. Don’t let them be the\nend of your trading career.\n \nSometimes your system is not set in exact stops, but it’s different in every case because\nyou put your stop above some event like a recent high or a resistance level. In that case,\nyou only need to calculate your position size according to that stop.\n \nFor example: if you want to risk 1% of $10k, or $100. and your stop is set to 34 pips,\nthen 34 pips should equal $100  or 100/34 x 10,000 = $29,411. Depending on your\nbroker, sometimes you can’t trade such an exact position. So you can use what’s closer,\nin this case $29k or $30k.\n \nIf you are risking 2% of your $10k account, or $200 in this case, your formula will be\n200/34 x 10,000 = 58,823\n \nThe formula will be:\n \nYour risk amount in $ / the amount of pips your stop is set to x 10,000\nT\nHE\n B\nLACK\n S\nWANS\n \n \nThere’s a factor to consider in trading that could impact so greatly your account that it\ncan make you a huge amount of money in one day or decimate your account to rags.\n \nThey are the Black Swan events (using the term coined by Nassim Taleb in his book by\nthe same name).\n \nI will put as an example: the very recent Swiss Franc event. The Central Bank of\nSwitzerland wanted to keep its currency (the Swiss franc) in a tight range with the euro,\nonly because people were moving so much money to Switzerland that the franc was\nquickly appreciating, making it hard for Swiss companies to make a profit outside of\ntheir country because everything was getting so much expensive in Switzerland. It was\naffecting tourism and small businesses because people from Switzerland will just cross\nthe borders to a bordering country to buy everything they needed, from groceries to\ngasoline.\n \nSo the Central Bank decided to buy euros and sell francs every time the currency tried\nto move higher (in huge amounts). In the beginning, the plan seemed to work and things\nwere kept in check for a long time. Of course, even Central Banks have only a certain\namount of money they can count on. So, after several years of this policy, one day they\nfound out that they could no longer enforce this policy and decided to stop buying euros,\nwithout any warning or exit plan or anything, just stop buying.\n \nIn an instant all the CHF (Swiss franc) related pairs went nuts. For example, the\nUSDCHF (US dollar / Swiss franc) went down by around 1,900 pips in a single day,\nwell, actually, in a few minutes. This had tremendous impact in the Forex markets;\nsuddenly all the leveraged positions the brokers were holding exploded and became\nlike an atom bomb.\nThe problem is that when these events happen, markets go so crazy that even stops and\ntake profits can’t be filled, there are so many orders to get out of the trades that there is\nsimply not enough liquidity, or the markets move so fast that it’s impossible to honor\nsimple stop losses or take profits orders.\n \nIn our example of a $10k account, let’s say you were in the USD/CHF risking 3%, or\n$300 from a 20 pips loss, that would have make you hold a $150,000 position. If you’d\nhave been in the right side of the trade, suddenly you would have shown a +$21,850\nprofit or $31,850 as a total capital.\n \nOn the other hand, if you would have been on the wrong side of the trade, your account\nwill be -$11,850 in debit!!\n \nIn the terms and conditions of the brokerage accounts they have a policy to take you out\nbefore you are in red numbers, but in this case there was no time or chance to do it. So,\nbrokers had to face millions of dollars in losses they couldn’t collect from clients. Even\nbig established brokers had problems and some had to file for bankruptcy.\n \nThis story is to illustrate the rare events that happen in the market every once in a while;\nit doesn’t matter how much you prepare, they do happen. Before the CHF event, there\nwas the 2008 crisis, or 9/11, or Katrina.\n \nThe only thing you can do to protect from these events is to:\nALWAYS trade with a stop loss, no matter what; not doing so is like jumping from the\nplane without a parachute.\n \nAfter a winning streak from your normal trading, maybe if you double your account, or if\nyou are up 50% or whatever number suits you, withdraw some money from your Forex\naccount into your bank or change it to gold or stocks or whatever you like, to protect you\nfrom catastrophic events and/or problems the brokers might have.\n \nThe most important one: don’t trade your rent money, or the money you need to live. Be\nresponsible about this and you will have much less pressure on your shoulders. This\nwill give you a much better chance to trade right and be focused and professional about\nyour trading.\nT\nHE\n I\nMPORTANCE\n \nOF\n H\nAVING\n \nA\n T\nRADING\n P\nLAN\n \nThe following chapter is a post from my blog forexlife.me, I decided to include it in the\nbook since I believe it speaks a very important subject on Forex trading many times\nneglected, that can be the difference between winning and losing in the markets: the\nimportance of having a great trading plan.\n \nIn 1815, Napoleon was back in power and back in business after his escape from forced\nexile.\n \nEvery leader in Europe was well aware that if Napoleon would get strong again, blood\nwill run through Europe once more and empires will fall to his feet again.\n \nTherefore Everyone who could, sent his army to defeat the \nEnfant Terrible\n: The United\nKingdom, Russia, Austria, Netherlands, Belgium and Prussia mobilized armies to defeat\nNapoleon, forming the Seventh Coalition.\n \nHowever outnumbered, Napoleon had a much stronger leadership and a better equipped\nand trained army. Knowing that his enemies were approaching he decided to take the\nupper hand and attack first.\nNapoleon\n \nHis first strategic move was to defeat the Prusian leader Prince Blücher so he could\navoid him to join the Duke of Wellington’s army which would have made a huge army\ntoo big for Napoleon to defeat; he fought Blücher and defeated his army on June 16 at\nthe Battle of Ligny.\n \nThe Prussian Leader had basically amateurs and volunteers for soldiers, his artillery\nwas incomplete and reorganizing; the Cavalry and infantry were mostly unequipped and\nundertrained. However his leaders and himself were well prepared, they had a very\nstrong line of command and had a plan to strictly follow in case things went wrong,\nwhich they did.\n \nAt the first sign of a losing battle; finding the help of the Duke of Wellington, his main\nally, well a day away, and seeing the much stronger French army and tactics, the\nPrussians strategy was to simply retreat, cutting their losses short, to a safer spot on the\nnorth, in a counterintuitive move to still stay close to the Duke of Wellington in case they\nneeded to help each other later on.\n \nNapoleon felt so empowered because of this victory that simply didn’t give enough\nattention to the Prussians retreat, thinking that they will just flee back home to a stronger\nposition. He did send a small army to pursue them but already one day too late to reach\ntem and stop their regrouping at the north.\n \nAt this point Napoleon thought that his plan of separating the Duke of Wellington Army\nand the Prussian Army was already a success. Pursuing the Duke of Wellington, who\nwas retreating after the defeat of the Prussians, all the way back to Waterloo one step\ncloser to the sea, where Napoleon was expecting to drive the Brits and force them back\nto Britain.\n \nThe Duke of Wellington was commanding the combined forces from the United\nKingdom, Netherlands and Belgium. However bigger in numbers, they were weaker\ncompared to the more prepared and loyal armies of Napoleon which were veterans of\nmany battles and were following Napoleon blindly and even fanatically.\n \nThe Duke of Wellington chose a good spot to fight (Waterloo) and did a good job\nholding Napoleon’s forces throughout the day forcing heavy losses on both sides.\n \nIf you could have seen the battle from above, one could have see that, although with a\ngreat effort, Napoleon was much closer to the victory. If he had followed a detailed\nplan, most likely Napoleon would have never let the Prussians escape after the defeat.\n \nMaybe he wouldn’t have attacked a stronger post like Waterloo were heavy loses were\nforeseeable because it was a good place to defend and a hard one to attack.\nHe was so excited about his winnings that he simply thought of himself as invincible and\ndecided to march and fight the Duke of Wellington, although there were a few factors\nthat were not 100% in his favor in this attack.\n \nWhen things were definitely leaning towards Napoleon the Duke of Wellington famously\nsaid: “Night or the Prussians must come”. To his luck, the Prussians had time to regroup\nand were marching towards Napoleon’s left flank. The decimated French forces that had\nalready fought all day couldn’t stop the Prussians and eventually, Napoleon’s left flank\nretreated and blocked the right flank’s possible way of retreat.\n \nWith the confusion reigning in the French troops and without a good retreat plan;\nNapoleon never thought he could lose a battle so he simply didn’t think what to do in\ncase something went wrong, Napoleon’s Army was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo\non Sunday, 18 June 1815, marking his fall from power and his last days as the\nCommander and leader of the French.\nPrince Leberecht von Blücher\n \nWar and Forex Trading are quite similar in many ways. We, as retail traders are more\nlike the Prince Blücher fighting Napoleon. We have less capital (a smaller, less capable\narmy) and we don’t have many allies to come to our help in case we guess the price\ndirection wrong. However we can choose what battles to fight and how to fight them;\nthat’s our ONLY advantage and the one thing we can plan and do right as traders.\n \nIf you feel yourself like Napoleon because you had a few winning trades and stop\nfollowing your own plan and rules, most likely you will make a mistake and your\nenemies will take advantage of it and destroy you.\n \nIn the long run The Market will only reward disciplined and humble traders who\nunderstand their strengths and plan for their limitations and know what to do in case\nthings go wrong.\nTo make a trading plan we must understand a few factors that are key to our success as\ntraders:\n1\n. \nPosition sizing – How big our position will be\n2\n. \nStop Loss – How much we are willing to lose in every trade in a percentage\nbasis\n3\n. \nTake profit – when are we planning to go out, how much are we expecting to\nwin in case things go our way. Do we intend to trail stops? Do we have a\nfixed take profit? Should we close half of our position at a predefined point\nand let the other half run?\n \nTogether with the specific setups we expect to find in the markets in order to enter the\ntrades and “engage in battle”.\n \nThis would be an example of a scalp-trading plan:\nI will only trade the NY Session\nI will close any open trades left before the NY session closes\nI will not trade around important news events like the NFP\nI will only trade pairs that are trending\nI will only trade pairs that offer a spread of 5 pips or less\nMy position sizing will limit my loses to 2% of my capital every time\nI will go for setups that provide at least a 2:1 opportunity\nI will move my s/l to break even when prices moves 50% of the desired\nmove\nI will only enter the markets if my setup coincides with the overall trend\nI will enter only if so and so indicators and so and so setups are telling me to\nenter (here is where you state your trading system for finding entry setups)\nI will enter a maximum of 5 trades a day no matter what\nI will stop trading the day if I lose 3 trades in a row\nAfter you have defined your trading plan you should print it and stick it right to your\ntrading station, and of course check it every time before entering a trade.\n \nAs you can see our trading plan is providing us quite a few elements that are vital to our\nsuccess in every trade:\n1\n. \nIt’s giving us clear rules on when to trade, avoiding us stress and\nrandomness in our trading\n2\n. \nIt’s protecting our capital and not letting our feelings get in the way when\ndeciding position sizing and where to place our stop losses and how to trail\nthem\n3\n. \nIt’s filtering many setups that maybe will be valid according to our trading\nsystem, but in which maybe the conditions are not 100% in our favor (think\nof Napoleon attacking the Duke at Waterloo)\n4\n. \nIt’s helping us choosing trades that could give us a greater profit and a\nsmaller loss\n5\n. \nIt’s protecting our own psychology and giving us a clear rule on when to stop\ntrading if things are not working and it’s better to call it a day\n \nAs you can see the benefits of using a Trading Plan are enormous and, in my experience\nusing one is the only way I know to protect your capital and achieve success in\nconsistent and long term way.\n \nIf you want to win consistently simply trade consistently and the money will flow in.\n \nPlease take a moment to do your trading plan according to your own trading style, your\npersonal rules, and try to think on your limitations, what things make your trading go\nwrong? when and how are you chronically making mistakes? What are the strengths of\nyour system? When and how is your system working at it’s best?\nY\nOUR\n 6-\nSTEP\n \nBLUEPRINT\n \nTO\n \nBECOME\n \nA\nPROFITABLE\n \nTRADER\n.\n \n \nAfter reading all the way to here, you already have the knowledge needed to do to build\na profitable Forex trading strategy however, it’s important to approach the developing\nof your own strategy in a disciplined way. If you have all the steps involved in the\ndeveloping of your strategy correctly outlined, you will understand better the whole\nprocess and how to correct or tweak certain elements of it.\n \n1\n. \nWrite down your goals for trading Forex (i.e., quit my day job making\n$4,000 a month of income in 1 year, grow my account to 1 Million in 5 years\nstarting with 10k, or whatever your goal is). This step is important and\ncritical to understand your approach to trading and your overall strategy\ndesign. Please set motivating but realistic goals, otherwise you risk\nleveraging too much and blowing your account.\n \n2\n. \nDefine how much you will have to earn to achieve your goals in a weekly,\nmonthly, and yearly basis; if you are starting with a sum of money and adding\nevery month, or whatever the numbers must be in order for you to reach your\ngoal. Don’t try to figure out the size of the trades or the risk yet, this step is\nonly meant to help you know how much money you will need to make to\nachieve your goals.\n \n3\n. \nDefine if you will trade on a position, swing, or scalp basis. You need to\nassess your personal situation and be realistic about the time you can commit\nfor trading.\n4\n. \nOnce you have your trading style, time frame and specific money objectives\nin place, try to define scenarios to achieving them, also considering the risk\nyou are taking.\n \nFor example: I need to make $300 a month from my $5,000 account swing trading\n2 - 3 trades a week. I will aim for $100 in every trade or 100 pips with a risk of\n50 pips. That will make my position $10k and risking 1% to make 2% of my\naccount in every trade. If I make 12 trades a month, I can have up to 5 winning\ntrades, 4 losing trades, and 3 break-even trades and still achieve my goal. Here\nyou can confirm with your trading system expectancy and see if your goal is\nreally possible to achieve.\n \nThese are only scenarios and they will never play exactly as you are planning them, but\nthey are important for you to understand what you are trying to achieve and how\npossible it really is. In this phase, you should back test with the charts to see if what you\nare planning appears possible and make any necessary adjustments to fine tune your\nstrategy in the back testing, never in real money trading, if you need to tweak do it in\ndemo or back testing only.\n \n5\n. \nOpen a demo account with the same amount of money you are planning to\nrisk in real life, with the broker you are planning to use, and follow your\nstrategy for at least 4 months. If you need more time, make it 6 months, but\nnot much more than that. If your strategy is not working after 6 months it\nprobably won’t work. Don’t tweak your strategy a lot. Try to keep it\nconsistent to see how it unfolds for your personal needs and trading style. If\nyou have two strategies that seemed to work good in back testing, go ahead\nand try them both simultaneously, just avoid strategies that demand too much\nattention because you could get distracted and non make the testing accurate.\n6\n. \nAfter this time, if your strategy is proving to be consistent, go ahead, open a\nreal account, and start trading; make a commitment to stop trading and go\nback to demo if you lose a specific amount of money, I’d say around 30% of\nyour capital, but you’ll know better what this number must be because you’ll\nhave all the information to understand if your strategy is working or not.\nF\nINAL\n \nTHOUGHTS\n \nAlthough trading is far from an easy way of earning money, the goal can be achieved if\nyou are willing to maintain the discipline and learning to do it. Remember that you are\ntrading for the long run; start small and build from there. After some time, winnings will\nstart to accumulate and your account can become a real wealth generator.\n \nI will outline a strategy to risk the least possible and keep you motivated to win more,\nthe numbers are examples and you can adapt them to your own situation and liking. But I\nlike big round numbers as milestones.\n \nIf you have $10,000 to trade, you can start with $2,000, leave the other $8,000 in your\nsavings account, and when, after some months you grow to $3,000 in your trading\naccount, maybe you can enter another $2,000 from your original $8,000 left.\n \nNow you will trade with $5,000, then after another few months when you reach $7,000\nmaybe you want to top your account with another $3,000 and make it $10,000.\n \nNow you will be trading $10,000, but your risk will be very limited because $3,000 of\nthat came from your own winnings. After you get to $15,000, you might want to enter\nyour money left and trade with $18,000 and enter your full position. From there, even in\na very bad scenario, you can lose up to $8,000 and still have your initial capital.\n \nIf you keep on winning and get it to $30,000, you might withdraw $5,000 from the Forex\naccount. Then, after taking the remaining $25,000 to $40,000, you might want to\nwithdraw another $5,000 and take all the risk from your account and recoup the initial\ninvestment.\n \nFrom there, every time you reach some milestone you determine, you will withdraw a\nportion to enjoy your profits and, at the same time, keep growing your account.\n \nIf, at some point, your trading stop working and you lose 30% of your capital, you\nshould go back to demo for at least 4 months to see if you can be profitable again before\ngoing back to trade real money. \n \nIf you trade focused on achieving the best possible performance, you might go rather fast\nand double your account every 6-8 months without much trouble, without taking your\nrisk to crazy territories. In this situation, you can start to earn real money after some 18 -\n24 months, even if you start with a modest sum of money.\n \nI hope that after reading my story and what I’ve learned after the wild ride it was to lose\nall my money and then make it back, I’ll save you from making the same mistakes I did.\nAnd, if you’ve already did all and / or other mistakes, maybe this book will help you to\nget back on your feet and become profitable.
