{"identifier": "holy-quran-english-page-013", "content": "Foreword\nThe English translation of The Holy Qur'an by the late I:Ia<_lrat MaulawI\nSher 'An (may Allah be pleased with him) was first published in Holland in\n1955 and since then many editions have been published in different countries.\nIn 1997 Islam International Publications Ltd. issued a new edition with an\nappendix containing alternative translations of some verses, or parts of verses,\nas well as explanatory notes to some of them by f:Ia<_lrat Mirza Tahir A]:imad,\nthe fourth successor of the Promised Messiah (may Allah bless his soul with\nHis infinite mercy). In the present edition we have dropped the appendix and\nbrought the material under relevant verses marking them with starlets*. (The\nalternative translations by I:Ia<_lrat Mirza Tahir A]:imad are given in bold letters.\nBut where he has made a deletion in the original translation, no bold letters\nare used). This, we hope, will facilitate the reader to make full use of these\nadditions. Starlets are also used to indicate publisher's notes, however, at the\nend of each such note, 'publisher' is printed in brackets. The symbols 't', ':I:'\nindicate the original notes by the translator.\nThe present project was begun under the instructions of f:Ia<_lrat Mirza\nTahir A]:imad, the fourth successor of the Promised Messiah and Head of the\nWorld Wide A]:imadiyya Muslim Jama'at (May Allah bless his soul with His\ninfinite mercy). Before f:Iu<_lur's demise, he constantly guided us and prayed for\nus; and made some changes in, and additions to, his own translation. After his\ndemise, f:Ia<_lrat Mirza Masroor A]:imad, Khalffatul MasI]:i the Fifth, has been\nguiding us and praying for us. Whenever we felt that in the appendix of the\nold edition some typing mistakes or minor mistakes of punctuation, setting etc.\nneeded to be corrected, we always sought guidance first from f:Ia<_lrat Khalffatul\nMasI]:i IV and later from f:Ia<_lrat Khalffatul Mas1]:i V. Only those corrections are\nincorporated which were approved by I:Ia<_lrat Khal!fatul Mas1]:i IV and later by\nI:Ia<_lrat Kha!Ifatul MasI]:i V.\nWe are pleased to record our gratitude and indebtedness to Mun1r-ud\u0002Dln Shams, Additional Wak!l-ut-Ta~nff, London, for his relentless help that he\ngave us in preparing this edition. He was always ready to present our textual\nand other difficulties to I:Ia<_lrat Kha!Ifatul MasI]:i and seek his guidance on our\nbehalf. We appreciate his constantly encourging us to bring out this edition as\nsoon as possible. We cannot, however, overlook to thank the team in Pakistan\nwho assisted Munfr-ud-Dln Shams in this difficult task. The team was headed\nby MirzaAnasA]:imad, M.A. M.Litt.

Thal is why by the end of the verse,\nthe conclusive declaration is that whatever may have happened they certainly failed to kill\nhim. This implies that it is not the act of crucifixion which is denied. What is denied is death\nby crucifixion.\nWa/iikin shuhhiha /ahum ( ~ 0 ~ ,): the word shuhhiha (0) in the text must be\ncarefully studied. The context of the preceding text would not permit'the implied reference to\nany other than Jesus or alternatively it could refer to the incident in general. In conformity with\nthe rules of grammar the implied pronoun in the word shubbiha (0) can refer to none other\nthan Jesus Christ himself. This means that it was he who was obscured and made to appear to\nthem similar to someone else. Hence as Jesus was hung upon the cross he hung in the likeness\nof someone else. Evidently the denial is not that of crucifixion or apparent death thereupon but\nthe denial is death by crucifixion. There certainly was great confusion as lo what actually had\nhappened. So the verse continues to build the scenario of the confusion and doubt. All else is\nnothing but conjecture. Thal is the final conclusion.\nIf the word shubbiha refers to the incident as such, this would point to the divergent\nclaims of the two disputing parties as to what had happened. Neither of the parties were certain\nof the validity of their claims. For instance the Christian belief of Jesus' death by crucifixion\nand later resurrection was not based on any tangible grounds but was merely conjectural.\nLikewise the Jewish claim of Jesus' death upon the cross was no less conjectural. Hence their\nappeal to Pilate for the possession of Jesus' body. In fact they clearly expressed their doubts\nregarding the entire episode of his so-called death and warned Pilate that in the likelihood of\nhis survival he might reappear in public claiming that he had risen from the dead. (Matthew\n27:63-64)\nTt is to this that the last part of the verse under study refers, when it says wa\ninnalladh,na (&.i}, i,,). Certainly those who differ about it (or about him as lo what actually\nbefell him) were themselves in doubt.\n,:, 159. Note: Bal rafa'ahulliihu ilaihi (~),i,', Ll; j.;): the majority of orthodox Muslims infer\nfrom this part of the verse that the connotation of Bal refers to the act of crucifixion i.e.,\ninstead ofletting him die upon the cross, God rescued him by raising him bodily to somewhere\nin the heavens. As such he should be living somewhere in space in the same corporal form that\nhe possessed prior to the attempt of his crucifixion. This interpretation raises many difficult\nquestions, mainly:\n(a) If Jesus was not crucified at all, is the entire history of crucifixion emphatically\ndenied and the whole episode just a fiction or delusion suffered by the Jews, the Christians and\nthe Romans alike''\n(b) Where in the verse is the claim that Jesus was raised bodily lo heavens? All that is\nmentioned simply is that Allah exalted him to Himself.\na i u I I th -=, I ~ T I kh r I dh ; I e er Q9 cf J, I ! b I ;, i; I ' f I gh f I q 3 I '\n(Seedetailsoftransliterationon page 'p').", "source": "holy-quran-english", "metadata": {"page_number": 156, "pages_total": 1028, "source_url": "https://files.alislam.cloud/pdf/Holy-Quran-English.pdf", "document_title": "The Holy Quran (English Translation)", "source": "holy-quran-english"}, "tags": ["holy-quran", "english-translation", "pdf-page"]}

And there is none among the\nPeople of the Book but will believe\nin it before his death; and on the\nDay of Resurrection, he (Jesus)\nshall be a witness against them\u0002Chapter 4 - r' •Y'\nAs to the first question the orthodox build a fantastic scenario according to which the\nfact of crucifixion itself is not denied but it is claimed that the person who was crucified was\nnot Jesus but someone else who was given the likeness of Jesus by some angels at the command\nof God. Hence the doubts and conjectures were about the identity of the person who was\ncrucified. Evidently this explanation creates only more problems than it solves. Moreover, the\nentire tale is absolutely without foundation. No scriptural evidence or evidence based on the\ntraditions of the Holy Prophet (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) is ever presented\nto support this bizarre claim which simply adds more conjectural confusion.\nTt is as if this explanation of the verse dawned only upon the medieval scholars while\nthe Messenger of God, peace be upon him, remained himself completely unaware of it.\nAs to the second question the weakness of the claim is apparent from the wording of\nthe Holy Qur'iin. The word rafa 'a (;J;) means elevated. Whenever Allah elevates a person the\nelevation always refers to the status of the person, never to his body. In fact it is impossible to\ntranslate this verse in any way other than the said meaning i.e., the elevation of spiritual\nstation.\nThe verse declares that Allah elevated Jesus to Himself. Evidently no point in space\nof Heaven is mentioned lo which Allah raised him. He raised him lo Himself while He was\npresent there where Jesus was. No place in Heaven or earth is empty of Allah's presence. So\nwhen someone is said lo be raised lo Him, a bodily movement is impossible and inconceivable.\nAccording to Ahmadiyya understanding of this verse, the connotation of 'on the contrary'\nrefers to the Jewish claim of the accursed death of Jesus. Obviously the opposite of curse is\nnearness to God.\n,:, 160. Note: This verse has been the subject of controversy regarding its real import. Some\nscholars believe that it refers to a remote future in relation to the time of crucifixion indicating\nthat all Jews without exception will one day have faith in Jesus Christ and accept him as a true\nProphet of God. They claim that it is also mentioned in this verse that this miracle would take\nplace in the lifetime of Jesus Christ. This they infer from the words qahla mautihi (H~ µ)\nwhich means before his death.\nAs the Jews have not yet accepted him, therefore, according to such scholars Jesus\nmust be still alive.\nAnother commonly held view is that the expression 'before his death' refers to every\nmember of the Jewish faith of the time of Jesus Christ. In this case this would mean that every\nJew would believe in Jesus Christ before his death-a claim which can only be verified by\nGod.\nUnfortunately many problems and difficulties stand in the way of accepting these\npropositions in toto.\nWe propose a completely different and new solution to the problem. The verse under\nstudy is translated as 'There is no one among the people of the Book but will certainly believe\nin him before his death.\"\nThe word in italics i.e., 'one' is not literally mentioned in the verse but is only implied.\nIf it were mentioned the verse would mean as follows:\nwain afiadimmin ahlilkitiibi -,4]1 -J-k' 0 ~I\"\"'\na i u I I th -=, I ~ T I kh r I dh ; I e er Q9 cf J, I ! .b I ;, i; I ' f I gh P-I q 3 I '\n(Seedetailsoftransliterationon page 'p').", "source": "holy-quran-english", "metadata": {"page_number": 157, "pages_total": 1028, "source_url": "https://files.alislam.cloud/pdf/Holy-Quran-English.pdf", "document_title": "The Holy Quran (English Translation)", "source": "holy-quran-english"}, "tags": ["holy-quran", "english-translation", "pdf-page"]}

If it was a bodily nakedness how could they have\nremained unaware of their nakedness from the time of their birth to the time of the said\nincident?\nTt is evident, therefore, that a literal meaning is wrongfully attributed to the Holy\nQur'an. The word sau 'ii (1~) primarily applies to acts of shame and evil propensities. At the\ntime of faltering the falterer discovers lo his horror his own hidden weaknesses. This weakness\nis psychological and internal, related to mind and heart, and cannot be covered and concealed\nby sticking leaves over one's body. So in the context of this error, whatever it was, which\nAdam and Eve committed, coverage can only mean seeking forgiveness from Allah and\n(seeking protection from Allah).

Note: The Quranic expression/araddii aidiyahwn f7 afwiihihim (~1,_;1 ~~~( 13;;;)\n(they turned their hands to their mouths) paints a picture of somebody putting his hand to his\nmouth indicating blockade. Before explaining this special expression one has also to determine\nas to who is referred to in this verse. Evidently this act is attributed to non-believers; so it has\ntwo possibilities of interpretation. It can be translated as: they, the non-believers, thrust their\nhands into their own mouths. This means that they refused to have any dialogue with the\nMessengers and their followers. This stage is reached when a person is ultimately nonplussed\nand is left with no arguments. So he acquires this posture of boycott, indicating that he has\nnothing more lo say.\nTn the second reading the reference may be to the mouths of the Messengers. Tt also\nindicates the same break in dialogue but in a different way. Hence the message would be that\nthe non-believers finally slop Messengers from further preaching telling them lo shut their\nmouths. This alternative is further supported by the remaining part of the verse where the non\u0002believers continue to develop the theme by saying further: 'We have rejected the message with\nwhich you were sent and verily we are in manifold doubt regarding that lo which you call us.'\na i u I I th -=, I ~ T I kh r I dh ; I e er Q9 cf J, I ! b I ;, i; I ' f I gh P-I q 3 I '\n(Seedetailsoftransliterationon page 'p').", "source": "holy-quran-english", "metadata": {"page_number": 372, "pages_total": 1028, "source_url": "https://files.alislam.cloud/pdf/Holy-Quran-English.pdf", "document_title": "The Holy Quran (English Translation)", "source": "holy-quran-english"}, "tags": ["holy-quran", "english-translation", "pdf-page"]}

There is no wonder why the past\ntense is used to indicate future, because most of such prophecies as arc inevitably bound to be\nfulfilled are expressed in the past tense in the Holy Qur'an. The past is unchangeable.\nProphecies in the past tense emphasise certainty. Thus the translation should run as follows:\n\"And We have, indeed given thee the seven oft repeated verses and the great\nQur'an. Do not stretch your eyes with greed towards the transient pleasure We have\nbestowed upon various groups among them, and grieve not over them; and lower your\nwing of mercy for the believers.

Like always, We\nshall send down punishment upon those who become split into sects, and who would split\nthe Qur'iin into segments.\"\nThis translation becomes evidently more appropriate when we bring into view the\ncontext of these verses and discover that the preceding verses begin with a dramatic introduction\nof the Holy Qur'an as a great Book. So all those who, despite claiming subservience lo the\nQur'an, disregard its most central message of unity, and get split into sects and to prove their\nown interpretation to be right end up by practically splitting the Qur'an into segments: each\ngroup sticking to some verses interpreting them to their own advantage as against others who\nstick to some other verses interpreting them to their own advantage. This split is described to\nbe so sharp and final that there is left no possibility of compromise between different warring\nfactions. This causes people of the same wnmah to split into sects and in the same process to\ndivide the Qur'an into segments.\na i u I I th -=, I ~ T I kh r I dh ; I e er Q9 cf J, I ! b I ;, i; I ' f I gh P-I q 3 I '\n(Seedetailsoftransliterationon page 'p').", "source": "holy-quran-english", "metadata": {"page_number": 389, "pages_total": 1028, "source_url": "https://files.alislam.cloud/pdf/Holy-Quran-English.pdf", "document_title": "The Holy Quran (English Translation)", "source": "holy-quran-english"}, "tags": ["holy-quran", "english-translation", "pdf-page"]}

And He has placed in the earth firm mountains to sustain you, and rivers and paths so that\nyou keep to the right path.\nNote: Many scholars have translated the phrase an tamTda hikum (;i, ~\"'')as 'quake' which\nif accepted would mean that God is counting His bounties upon mankind by reminding them\nthat He has created mountains to cause great earthquakes spelling destructions far and wide.\nUnfortunately, it has been ignored that the word tamtda (~) is derived from miida (,~)\nwhich means to provide food. The word mii\"idah (•,.;~) used in the Holy Qur'an is from the\nsame infinitive. With this meaning in view the entire understanding of this verse will be\ntransformed. It will remind mankind that God has created mountains which are essential for\nproviding food to all living beings. The water is constantly lifted from lakes, seas and oceans by\nevaporation carried by higher altitude to get condensed into thicker particles. The existence of\nmountains is essential for turning the vapour into water again, thus producing wide-spread rains\nwhich are channelled back to earth to create immense food chains. This translation is the only\none which fits into the context and is in perfect agreement with the remaining part of the verse.\nThe correct meaning, therefore, would be: 'He has entrenched mountains over the earth so\nthat they may provide you with food, and rivers and tracks so that you may be guided.'\nThe relation of waler and food is obvious. In the history of civilisation it was rivers\nwhich played the most important role in making the mountainous terrains possible and paths\nwere carved along the courses of rivers.\na i u I I th -=, I ~ T I kh r I dh ; I e er Q? cf J, I ! b I ;, i; I ' f I gh P-I q 3 I '\n(Seedetailsoftransliterationon page 'p').", "source": "holy-quran-english", "metadata": {"page_number": 393, "pages_total": 1028, "source_url": "https://files.alislam.cloud/pdf/Holy-Quran-English.pdf", "document_title": "The Holy Quran (English Translation)", "source": "holy-quran-english"}, "tags": ["holy-quran", "english-translation", "pdf-page"]}

They said, 'We heard a young\nman speak ill of them; he is called\nAbraham.'\n62. They said, 'Then bring him\nbefore the eyes of the people, that\nthey may bear witness.'\n63. Then they said to Abraham, 'Is\nit thou who hast done this to our\ngods, 0 Abraham?'\n,:,64. He replied, 'Aye, somebody has\nsurely done this. Here is their chief.\nBut ask them if they can speak.'\nChapter 21 - r1 ,¼3~1\n,:, 64. He replied, 'Aye, somebody has surely done this. Here is the chief suspect. Ask them if\nthey arc capable of speaking.'\nNote: Some translators avoid literal translation of this verse fearing that this would present\nAbraham as a liar. Obviously it was not the big idols who had smashed the smaller ones but it\nwas Abraham himself who had done it. Therefore attributing the statement to Abraham that\n'here is their chief/ would be tantamount to attributing an obvious lie to Abraham. It should\nbe noted, however, that it was not a misstatement but a powerful style of argument. Sometimes\na thing is too obvious for anybody to believe and a statement to that effect is never understood\nas a wilful attempt to mislead others but considered an exposition of the inherent absurdity of\na situation. We believe that Abraham did make that statement without the slightest intention of\nmisleading them but only by way of a powerful argument against the falsity of their belief.\nThis is exactly how they took it. Having heard Abraham, none of them retorted by calling him\na liar. But according to the Holy Qur'an they were introspectively forced to realise the folly of\ntheir belief. This is made clear in the following verses (see verses 65 lo 68). Again, it should\nbe remembered that before this incident Abraham himself had mentioned in public his resolve\nto smash their idols (see verse 58).\na i u I I th -=-I I, r I kh r I dh > I ~ J' ~ cf J, I / J, I ?

He said, 'O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne before they come lo me\noffering submission?'\nNote: From the following verses, it becomes clear that Solomon docs not refer to her throne\nitself. He either means a throne very similar lo hers should be manufactured or that a very\nfaithful replica of her throne should be brought to him. Before her intended visit to the court\nof Solomon, she is given the surprise of finding a throne very similar to her own but in the\npossession of Solomon. From the verses which follow, the scenario that emerges clearly\nindicates that each of the nobles of his court wanted the task to be assigned to him, each\nboasting to perform the task quicker and better than his rivals. Ultimately, when the replica\nwas first presented to him, he praised God for it and issued instructions to modify it further so\nthat it might resemble the Queen of Saba's throne ever more closely and so deflate her pride\nin possessing a unique throne. The expression nakkiru /aha 'arshaha( •_,jj.< ·-,i ,;;43) clearly\nsupports this meaning and implies that if she saw a throne very similar to her own, she would\nnaturally infer that her own throne was not as unique and special as she thought it was. So the\nmeaning of nakkin, (.;;43) in this context would make her throne seem common-looking.\nWhen she actually saw the throne built by Solomon's craftsmen, her response was not that of\na Queen who only recently had her own throne stolen, nor that of a Queen who could not\nrecognise her own throne because the craftsmen had worked on itto render it unrecognisable.\nHer response is simply that of a person who finds an article similar to her own. This clearly\nproves that the scenario we have visualised is more realistic.\n,:,41.
