It will take some time to read \nand memorize all the know-how so it is important that before you start reading this book you make sure that trading is suited for you. Here are the three principles to help understand if trading is the right path for you.\n1. Trade with free resources\nNever trade money that you can't aﬀord to lose. If you don’t have resources you can aﬀord to lose, then trading might not be for you yet.\n2. Try before you invest your time \nI always recommend my students to play around in user-friendly trading environments before jumping to books and complicated trading systems. I have come across some great and beginner-friendly platforms where you can \nlearn straight from the pros and even copy their trades thus letting them make money for you. /T_his is currently the best network to open free accounts in - Social Investment Network.\n2. Determine your risk appetite\nTrading involves risk and /f_inancial trading is not for people with low stress tolerance. Fortunately there is a tool for minimizing the risks - stop loss order which helps to leverage the exposure to risks and stress for people with higher risk appetite.\nINTRODUCTION\n1ou can be free. You can live and work anywhere in the world, be \nindependent from the routine and not answer to anybody.” With \nthose words I began my /f_irst book, Trading for a Living. One of my great \npleasures in the years since its publication has been meeting and becoming friends with people who became free thanks to successful trading. Several times a year I run a Traders’ Camp, a week of intensive classes at remote resorts. I enjoy my campers’ successes. A stockbroker became a full-time trader, closed his business, and moved to Rio to pursue a life-long interest in Latin women. A psychologist became such a successful options writer that she paid for an early retirement for her husband and moved with him to the Virgin Islands to become an expert in what she calls synchronous hammocking. A man bought a mountain in Vermont and trades from the house he built on its top. I wish all students could succeed, but it’s not that simple. How many psychiatrists does it take to change a lightbulb? Only one—but the bulb has to want to change. To succeed in trading you need several innate traits without which you shouldn’t even start. /T_hey include discipline, risk tolerance, and facility with numbers. A big fat guy who is o/f_ten drunk and can’t kick a cigarette habit is unlikely to make a good trader—he lacks discipline. A nitpicker who obsesses over each dime is too tense to live with market risks. A daydreamer who cannot do simple arithmetic on the run becomes lost when prices change rapidly. In addition to discipline, risk tolerance, and ease with numbers, successful trading requires 3 M’s—Mind, Method, and Money. Mind means developing psychological rules that will keep you calm amidst the\nnoise of the markets. Method is a system of analyzing prices and\ndeveloping a decision-making tree. Money refers to money manage-ment, which means risking only a small part of your trading capital onany trade; think of the way a submarine is divided into many com-partments so that it won’t sink if one section becomes flooded—youhave to structure your account this way. Psychology, trading tactics,money management—you can learn these skills.\nHow long will it take you to become a competent trader and how\nmuch will it cost? What rules do you set, what methods do you use,and how do you split your trading capital? What should you study first,second, and third? What markets should you trade, and how muchmoney can you expect to make? If these questions interest you, youpicked the right book.\nYou can succeed in trading. It has been done before, and it’s being\ndone right now, today, by people who started from scratch, learned totrade and are making a good living at it. The best ones make fortunes.Others fail, out of ignorance or lack of discipline. If you work throughthis book, ignorance will not be a problem, and you will hear me yellat you again and again, pointing you towards disciplined, responsible,professional trading.\nTrading is a journey of self-discovery. If you enjoy learning, if you\nare not scared of risk, if the rewards appeal to you, if you are preparedto put in the work, you have a great project ahead of you. You willwork hard and enjoy the discoveries you’ll make along the way.\nI wish you success. Now let us begin.\nHOWTHISBOOKISORGANIZED\nBooks written from the heart acquire their own direction. They developand change in the process of being written. You start with a plan, butthe book takes over, and before you know it, you’re going much far-ther than planned.\nI began writing this book three years ago on a flight to New York,\nreturning from a Traders’ Camp in Mexico. We had more beginnersthan usual, many of them women. They kept asking for a book thatthey jokingly called Trading for Dummies . There were no dummies in\nour group. Those campers were smart, sharp, and motivated—but theyneeded to learn the rules and the tools. I figured I would write a brief2 INTRODUCTION\npractical introduction, call it Financial Trading for Babes in the Woods ,\nand be done by Christmas.\nThree Christmases passed before I completed my project. The beginner\npart was easy, but I kept tunneling into the depths of trading, sharingwhat I learned in the nine years since Trading for a Living was pub-\nlished. I developed new indicators and systems. My money managementbecame crisper, and I designed a new approach to record keeping. Mywork with hundreds of traders showed me how to teach people to turntheir trading lives around and move from haphazard jumping in andout to a calm professional style. Take a few minutes to read how thisbook is organized, so that you may get full value out of it.\nPart One, Financial Trading for Babes in the Woods , is written pri-\nmarily for those who are just becoming interested in trading. It laysout topics whose mastery is essential for success and puts up dangersigns around the main pitfalls. Even experienced traders would do wellto review this chapter, especially the concept of external barriers tosuccess, which has never before been spelled out in trading literature,and the critique of the efficient market theory.\nPart Two, The Three M’s of Successful Trading , teaches you the\nthree key aspects of trading—Mind, Method, and Money. Mind isyour trading psychology. Method is how you go about finding tradesand making entry and exit decisions. Money is how you manage yourtrading capital for long-term survival and success. Once we reviewthe psychological rules, I’ll share with you my favorite analytic tools,some of which I have never before revealed. We will cover systemtesting, day-trading, and a new method for placing stops. The step-by-step money management strategy has never before appeared intrading literature.\nPart Three, Come into My Trading Room , delivers another first—a set\nof exact instructions for organizing your time and effort, as well askeeping good records. Proper record keeping is a hallmark of suc-cessful trading. Good records help you learn from your mistakes aswell as victories. You know you should keep records, but now you’llsee exactly how to do it. By the time you work through this section,nobody can call you “a babe in the woods.”\nTake your time as you read this book, mark it up, return to the sec-\ntions that interest you most. This volume distills 20 years of trading andteaching experience. It took three years to write, and it will probablyINTRODUCTION 3\ntake more than one reading to get its full value. Open your charting\nsoftware, pull out your trading records, test all the concepts on yourown data. Only testing will make these ideas your own.\nBy the time you leave my trading room, you’ll be in a position to take\nyour trading to a higher, more intelligent, and successful level. \nMALE OR FEMALE ?\nAlmost every nonfiction writer faces the dilemma—which pronoun touse. He? She? He or she?\nMale traders outnumber women by about twenty to one, although\nthis ratio is rapidly becoming more balanced as more and more womencome into the markets. In our Traders’ Camps, which attract the moresophisticated segment of traders, we have already moved from a greatpreponderance of men to a near parity with women.\nI find that the percentage of successful traders is higher among\nwomen. They tend to be less arrogant, and arrogance is a deadly sinin trading. The male ego—that wonderful trait that has been bringingus wars, riots, and bloodshed since time immemorial—tends to getheavily caught up in trading. A guy studies his charts, decides to buy,and now his self-esteem is involved—he has to be right! If the marketgoes his way, he waits to be proven even more right—bigger is better.If the market goes against him, he is tough enough to stand the painand waits for the market to reverse and prove him right—while itgrinds down his account.\nWomen traders, on the other hand, are much more likely to ask a sim-\nple question—where’s the money? They like to take profits and focus onavoiding losses instead of trying to prove themselves right. Women aremore likely to bend with the wind and go with the flow, catch trendsand hop off a little earlier, booking profits. When I tell traders that keep-ing records is a hugely important aspect of success, women are morelikely to keep them than men. If you are looking to hire a trader, all otherfactors being equal, I’d recommend looking for a woman.\nStill, there are many more male than female traders. The English lan-\nguage being what it is, “he” flows better than “he or she” or even jump-ing between the two pronouns. To make reading easier, I’ll use themasculine pronoun throughout this book. I trust you understand that nodisrespect is intended toward women traders. I want to make this bookeasier to read for everybody, of any gender, anywhere in the world.4 INTRODUCTION\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nPART\nONE\nFINANCIAL\nTRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nAre traders born or made? There is no simple answer. Both aptitude\nand learning are important, but in different proportions for differ-\nent people. At one extreme are born geniuses who require very littlelearning. At the other are gamblers and dunces, whom no classes arelikely to help. The rest of us are in the middle of the curve, with someaptitude but in need of education.\nA genius has little need for a book because he has a fantastic feel\nfor the market. A gambler is too busy getting high on adrenaline. Thisbook is written for the trader in the middle.\nCHAPTER\nONE\nINVEST?\nTRADE?GAMBLE?\nAnewcomer to the market faces three paths that lead into a forest\nfull of treasures and dangers. The first path, for investors, goes\nthrough the sunniest areas. Most of those who take it come out alive,if not much richer. Another path, for traders, leads into the heart of theforest. Many travelers disappear, but those who come out look rich.The third is a shortcut that takes gamblers into the swamp.\nHow can you tell which path is which? You must choose your way\ncarefully because if you don’t, you’ll end up on the gamblers’ path,especially since it crosses both investors’ and traders’ trails. We’ll returnto this question in the chapters on trading psychology.\nANINTELLIGENT INVESTOR\nInvestors profit by recognizing new trends in the economy and buyinginto them before the majority wakes up to opportunities. A knowl-edgeable investor can earn huge percentage gains by holding his posi-tion without being terribly active.\nBack in the 1970s, I bought stock in a company called KinderCare,\nwhich ran a chain of child care centers. It tried to make them as uni-form and reliable as McDonalds’ hamburgers. KinderCare catered to babyboomers who were having babies right, left, and center. Half of myfriends were pregnant at that time. A major social shift was taking placein the United States, with women going to work in record numbers.Someone had to mind the babies of all those two-income families, andthe stock of KinderCare soared on the crest of a new social trend.\nAT&T used to have a monopoly on long-distance phone calls. Then\nin the late 1970s a tiny brash upstart called MCI won a legal dogfight,\n7\nallowing it to compete with AT&T. The age of deregulation was upon\nus, and the stock of MCI—the first company into the breach—sold for$3 presenting another great opportunity to hop aboard a new trend.\nA few years ago I flew into New York from the Caribbean with my\nfriend George. He became a millionaire by buying $30,000 worth of Dellstock before most people had heard of the company—and unloading itat the top three years later with the help of technical analysis. Sprawledin his first-class seat, George was perusing several investment advisories,trying to lock in on the next trend in Internet technology. How right hewas! Within a year Internet stocks were flying, defying gravity.\nThat’s the lure of investing. If you can buy a chunk of Dell at $4 a\nshare and cash out at $80 a few years later, it is easy to fly down to a re-sort for a week rather than sit in front of a monitor watching every tick.\nWhat are the disadvantages? Investing requires a great deal of patience\nand an immense supply of self-confidence. To buy Chrysler after it wasrescued from the brink of bankruptcy or Internet search engines beforeanyone knew what those words meant, you had to have a huge level ofconfidence in your ability to read the trends in society and the e conomy.\nAll of us are smart after the fact; very few are smart early in the game, andonly the tiniest percentage has the emotional strength to make a large beton their vision and hold on to it. Those who can do this consistently,like Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch, are hailed as superstars.\nANINTELLIGENT TRADER\nTraders make money by betting on short-term price swings. The ideais to buy when our reading of the market tells us prices are rising andsell when the uptrend runs out of steam. Alternatively, we can bet ona decline and sell short when our analysis points to a downtrend, cov-ering when the downtrend starts bottoming out. The concept is simple,but implementing it is difficult.\nIt is hard to become a good analyst, but harder to become a good trader.\nBeginners often assume they can make money because they’re smart,computer-literate and have a record of success in business. You can get afast computer and even buy a backtested system from a vendor, but put-ting money on it is like trying to sit on a three-legged stool with two legsmissing. The two other factors are psychology and money management.\nBalancing your mind is just as important as analyzing markets. Your\npersonality influences your perceptions, making it a key aspect of yoursuccess or failure. Managing money in your trading account is essential8 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nfor surviving the inevitable drawdowns and prospering in the long run.\nPsychology, market analysis, and money management—you have to mas-ter all three to become a success.\nThere are two main approaches to profiting from crowd behavior. The\nfirst is momentum trading—buy when a ripple starts running through thecrowd, sending the market higher, and sell when that ripple starts losingspeed. It is a challenge to identify a new trend while it’s still young. Asthe trend speeds up and the crowd becomes exuberant, amateurs fall inlove with their positions. Professionals remain calm and monitor thetrend’s speed. As soon as they find that the crowd is returning to its nor-mal sleepiness, they take profits without waiting for a reversal.\nThe other method is the countertrend strategy. It involves betting\nagainst the deviations and for a return to normalcy. Countertrendtraders sell short when an upside breakout starts running out of speedand cover when a downtrend starts petering out. Beginners love totrade against trends (“let’s buy, this market can’t go any lower!”), butmost get impaled on a price spike that fails to reverse. A man who likespeeing against the wind has no right to complain about his cleaningbills. Professionals can trade against trends only because they are readyto run at the first sign of trouble. Before you bet on a reversal, be sureyour exit strategy and money management are fine-tuned.\nMomentum traders and countertrend traders capitalize on two oppo-\nsite aspects of crowd behavior. Before you put on a trade, be sure toknow whether you’re investing, momentum trading, or countertrendtrading. Once you’ve entered a trade, manage it as planned! Don’tchange your tactics in the midst of a trade because then you’ll con-tribute to the winners’ welfare fund.\nAmateurs keep thinking what trades to get into, while professionals\nspend just as much time figuring out their exits. They also focus onmoney management, calculating what size positions they can affordunder current market conditions, whether to pyramid, when to takepartial profits, and so on. They also spend a great deal of time keep-ing good records of their trades.\nThe Efficient Market Theory\nA trader strains his mind, his soul, his entire being trying to take prof-its out of the market when an unsettling piece of news comes downthe pike—the efficient market theory. Its main adherents are academ-ics, who are fond of pointing out that prices reflect all available mar-INVEST? TRADE? GAMBLE? 9\nket information. People buy and sell on the basis of their knowledge,\nand the latest price represents everything known about that market.This is a valid observation, from which the efficient market gang drawsthe curious conclusion that no one can beat the market. Markets knoweverything, they say, and trading is like playing chess against someonewho knows more than you. Don’t waste your time and money—simplyindex your portfolio and select stocks based on volatility.\nWhat about traders who make money? The efficient market theorists\nsay that winners are plain lucky. Most people make money at somepoint, before bleeding it back into the markets. What about thosewho keep outperforming markets year after year? Warren Buffett, oneof the twentieth century’s great investors, says that investing in a mar-ket in which people believe in efficiency is like playing poker againstthose who believe it does not pay to look at cards.\nI think that the efficient market theory offers one of the truest views of\nthe markets. I also believe it is one of the largest pieces of theoreticalgarbage. The theory correctly observes that markets reflect the intelli-gence of all crowd members; it is fatally flawed in assuming that investorsand traders are rational human beings who always strive to maximizegains and minimize losses. That is a very idealized view of human nature.\nMost traders can be rational on a fine weekend when the markets\nare closed. They calmly study their charts and decide what to buy andsell, where to take profits, and when to cut losses. When the marketsopen on Monday, the best laid plans of mice and men get ripped upin the sweaty palms of traders.\nTrading and investing are partly rational and partly emotional. People\noften act on an impulse even if they harm themselves in the process ofdoing so. A winning gambler brags about his positions and misses sellsignals. A fearful trader beaten up by the market becomes cautiousbeyond measure. As soon as his stock ticks down a bit, he sells, violat-ing his own rules. When that stock rises, overshooting his original profittarget, he can no longer stand the pain of missing the rally and buysway above his planned entry point. The stock stalls and slides, and hewatches, first with hope and later frozen in horror, as it sinks like a rock.In the end, he can’t take any more pain and sells out at a loss—right nearthe bottom. What’s so rational about this process? The original plan to buymay have been rational, but implementing it created an emotional storm.\nEmotional traders do not pursue their best long-term interests. They\nare too busy savoring the adrenaline rush or too twisted in fear, des-10 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nperate to extract their fingers from a mousetrap. Prices reflect intelli-\ngent behavior of rational investors and traders, but they also reflectscreaming mass hysteria. The more active the market, the more tradersare emotional. Rational individuals can become a minority, surroundedby those with sweaty palms, pounding hearts, and clouded minds.\nMarkets are more efficient during flat trading ranges, when people\nare apt to use their heads. They grow less efficient during trends, whenpeople become more emotional. It is hard to make money in flat mar-kets because your opponents are relatively calm. Rational people makedangerous enemies. It is easier to take money from traders who areexcited by a fast-moving trend because emotional behavior is moreprimitive and easier to predict. To be a successful trader you must keepyour cool at all times and take money from aroused amateurs.\nPeople are more likely to be rational when alone, and grow more\nimpulsive when they join crowds. A trader’s intense focus on the priceof a stock, a currency, or a future pulls him into the crowd of all whotrade that vehicle. As the price ticks up and down, the eyes, the heads,and the bodies of traders across the continents start moving up anddown in unison. The market hypnotizes traders like a magician hyp-notizes a snake, by moving his flute rhythmically up and down. Thefaster the price moves, the stronger the emotions. The more emotionala market, the less efficient it is, and inefficiency creates profit oppor-tunities for calm, disciplined traders.\nA rational trader can make money by remaining calm and following\nhis rules. Around him, the crowd chases rallies, hard with greed. It sellsinto falling markets, squealing from pain and fear. All the while, theintelligent trader follows his rules. He may use a mechanical system oract as a discretionary trader, reading his markets and putting on trades.Either way, he follows his rules rather than his gut—that is his greatadvantage. A mature trader pulls money through the big hole in theefficient market theory, its presumption that investors and traders arerational human beings. Most people aren’t; only winners are.\nWhat Is Price?\nEach trade represents a transaction between a buyer and a sellerwho meet face to face, by phone or on the Internet, with or withoutbrokers. A buyer wants to buy as cheaply as possible. A seller wantsto sell as expensively as possible. Both feel pressure from the crowd ofINVEST? TRADE? GAMBLE? 11\nundecided traders that surrounds them, ready to jump in and snatch\naway their bargain.\nA trade takes place when the greediest buyer, afraid that prices will run\naway from him, steps up and bids a penny more. Or the most fearfulseller, afraid of getting stuck with his merchandise, agrees to accept apenny less. Sometimes a fearful seller dumps his merchandise on a calmand disciplined buyer waiting for a trade to come to him. All trades reflectthe behavior of the market crowd. Each price flashing on your screen rep-resents a momentary consensus of value among market participants.\nFundamental values of companies and commodities change slowly,\nbut prices swing all over the lot because the consensus can changequickly. One of my clients used to say that prices are connected to val-ues with a mile-long rubber band, allowing markets to swing betweenovervalued and undervalued levels.\nThe normal behavior of the crowd is to mill around, make noise, and\ngo nowhere. Once in a while a crowd becomes excited and explodesin a rally or a panic, but usually it just wastes time. Bits of news andrumors send ripples through the crowd, whose shifts leave footprints onour screens. Prices and indicators reflect changes in crowd psychology.\nWhen the market gives no clear signals to buy or sell short, many\nbeginners start squinting at their screens, trying to recognize tradingsignals. A good signal jumps at you from the chart and grabs you bythe face—you can’t miss it! It pays to wait for such signals instead offorcing trades when the market offers you none. Amateurs look forchallenges; professionals look for easy trades. Losers get high from theaction; the pros look for the best odds.\nFast-moving markets give the best trading signals. When crowds are\ngripped by emotions, cool traders find their best opportunities to makemoney. When markets go flat, many successful traders withdraw, leav-ing the field to gamblers and brokers. Jesse Livermore, a great specu-lator of the twentieth century, used to say that there is time to go long,time to go short, and time to go fishing.\nANINTELLIGENT GAMBLER ?\nMost people gamble at some point in their lives. For most it providesentertainment, for some it becomes an addiction, while a few become\npros and make a living at it. Gambling provides a living for a very\nsmall minority and entertainment for the masses, but a casual gambler12 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nreaching for a quick buck has the same chance of success as an ice\ncube on a hot stove.\nSome famous investors like betting on horses. They include Peter\nLynch, of Magellan Fund fame, and Warren Buffett, who used to pub-lish a newsletter on handicapping. My friend Lou, to whom my firstbook was dedicated, spent several years on the handicapping circuitand bet on horses for a living before buying an exchange seat and ap-proaching financial markets like a cool handicapper. Some card games,such as baccarat, are based on chance alone, whereas others, such asblackjack, involve a degree of skill that attracts intelligent people.\nProfessionals treat gambling as a job. They keep calculating odds\nand act only when mathematics point in their favor. Losers, on theother hand, itch for the action and enter one game after another,switching between half-baked systems.\nWhen you gamble for entertainment, follow a set of money man-\nagement rules. The first rule is to limit how much you’ll risk in anygiven session. On a rare occasion when a friend pulls me into a casino,I put what I am willing to lose that night into my right pocket, and stuffmy winnings, if any, into the left one. I stop playing as soon as myright pocket is empty, without ever reaching into the left. Once in awhile I find more money in the left pocket than I had in my right, butI certainly do not count on it.\nA friend who is a successful businessman enjoys the glitter of Las\nVegas. Several times a year he takes $5,000 in cash and flies there for aweekend. When his bankroll runs out, he goes for a swim in the pool,enjoys a good dinner, and flies back home. He can afford to spend$5,000 on entertainment and never blows more than his initial stake.Lounging at a pool after his cash is gone, he differs from legions ofcompulsive gamblers who keep charging more chips on their creditcards, waiting for their “luck” to turn. A gambler with no money man-agement is guaranteed to bust out.INVEST? TRADE? GAMBLE? 13\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nCHAPTER\nTWO\nWHAT MARKETS \nTO TRADE?\nMany people give little thought to life’s important decisions. They\nstumble into them by accidents of geography, time, or chance.\nWhere to live, where to work, what markets to trade—many of usdecide on a whim, without much serious thought. No wonder so manyare dissatisfied with their lives. You can choose your markets on awhim or pause to think whether to trade stocks, futures, or options.Each of those has pluses as well as minuses.\nSuccessful traders are rational people. Winners trade solely for the\nmoney, while losers get their kicks out of the excitement of the game.Where those kicks land is another question.\nIn choosing a market to trade, keep in mind that every trading\nvehicle, be it a stock, a future, or an option, has to meet two criteria:\nliquidity and volatility. Liquidity refers to the average daily volume,compared with that of other vehicles in its group. The higher thevolume, the easier it is to get in and out. You can build a profitableposition in a thin stock, only to get caught in the door at the exit andsuffer slippage trying to take profits. Volatility is the extent of move-ment in your vehicle. The more it moves, the greater the trading op-portunities. For example, stocks of many utility companies are veryliquid but hard to trade because of low volatility—they tend to stay innarrow price ranges. Some low-volume, low-volatility stocks may begood investments for your long-term portfolio, but not for trading.Remember that not all markets are good for trading simply becauseyou have a strong opinion on their future direction. They also musthave good volume and move well.\n15\nSTOCKS\nA stock is a certificate of company ownership. If you buy 100 shares\nof a company that issued 100 million shares, you own one-millionthof that firm. You become a part owner of that business, and if otherpeople want to own it, they will have to bid for your shares, liftingtheir value.\nWhen people like the prospects of a business, they bid for its shares,\npushing up prices. If they don’t like the outlook, they sell their stock,depressing prices. Public companies try to push up share pricesbecause it makes it easier for them to float more equity or sell debt.The bonuses of top executives are often tied to stock prices.\nFundamental values, especially earnings, drive prices in the long\nrun, but John Maynard Keynes, the famous economist and a cannystock picker, retorted “In the long run we’re all dead.” Markets are fullof cats and dogs, stocks of unprofitable companies that at some pointfly through the roof, defying gravity. Stocks of sexy new industries,such as biotechnology or the Internet, can fly on the expectations offuture earnings rather than on any real operating records. Each dog hasits day in the sun before reality sets in. Stocks of profitable, well-runcompanies may drift sideways to down. The market reflects the sumtotal of what every participant knows, thinks, or feels about a stock, anda declining price means large holders are selling. The essential rule inany market is “It’s OK to buy cheap, but not OK to buy down.” Don’t buya stock that’s trending lower, even if it looks like a bargain. If you likeits fundamentals, use technical analysis to confirm that the trend is up.\nWarren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in America, is\nfond of saying that when you buy a stock, you become a partner of amanic-depressive fellow he calls Mr. Market. Each day Mr. Market runsup and offers either to buy you out of business or to sell you his share.Most of the time you should ignore him because the man is psychotic,but occasionally Mr. Market becomes so terribly depressed that heoffers you his share for a song—and that’s when you should buy. Atother times he becomes so manic that he offers an insane price foryour share—and that’s when you should sell.\nThis idea is brilliant in its simplicity, but hard to implement. Mr.\nMarket sweeps most of us off our feet because his mood is so conta-gious. Most people want to sell when Mr. Market is depressed and buy16 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nwhen he is manic. We need to keep our sanity. We need objective cri-\nteria to decide how high is too high and how low is too low. Buffettmakes his decisions on the basis of fundamental analysis and a fantas-tic gut feel. Traders can use technical analysis.\nSpeaking of gut feel, this is something that an investor or a trader\nmay develop after years of successful experience. What beginners callgut feel is usually an urge to gamble, and I tell them they have no rightto a gut feel.\nWhat stocks should we trade? There are more than 10,000 of them\nin the United States, with even more abroad. Peter Lynch, a highly suc-cessful money manager, writes that he only buys stocks in companiesthat are so simple that an idiot could run them—because eventuallyone will. But Lynch is an investor, not a trader. Stocks of many com-panies with little fundamental value can embark on fantastic runs, mak-ing heaps of money for bullish traders before collapsing and makingjust as much money for the bears.\nThe stock market offers a wealth of choices, even after we cut out\nilliquid or flat stocks. You open a business newspaper, and stories offantastic rallies and breathtaking declines leap at you from the pages.Should you jump on the bandwagon and trade stocks in the news?Have they moved too far from the gate? How do you find future lead-ers? Having to make so many choices stresses beginners. They spreadthemselves thin, jumping between stocks instead of focusing on a fewand learning to trade them well. Newbies who cannot confidentlytrade a single stock go looking for scanning software that will let themtrack thousands.\nIn addition to stocks, you can choose from their kissing cousins,\nmutual funds, called unit trusts in Europe. Long-term investors tend\nto put money into diversified funds which hold hundreds of stocks.Traders tend to focus on sector funds that let them trade specific sec-tors of the economy or entire countries. You pick a favorite sector orcountry and leave individual stock selection to the supposedly hot-shotanalysts laboring at those funds.\nChoosing a winning stock or fund is a lot harder than listening to\ntips at a party or scanning headlines in a newspaper. A trader must de-velop a set of fundamental or technical search parameters, have thediscipline to follow his system, and spread a safety net of money man-agement under his account. We will delve into all three areas in Part 2.WHAT MARKETS TO TRADE? 17\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?How to Buy Stocks by Louis Engel is the best\nintroductory book for stock investors and traders. The author died yearsago, but the publisher updates the book every few years—be sure toget the latest edition.\nFUTURES\nFutures look dangerous at first—nine out of ten traders go bust in theirfirst year. As you look closer, it becomes clear that the danger is not infutures but in the people who trade them. Futures offer traders someof the best profit opportunities, but the dangers are commensurate withrewards. Futures make it easy for gamblers to shoot themselves in thefoot, or higher. A trader with good money management skills needn’tfear futures.\nFutures used to be called commodities , the irreducible building blocks\nof the economy. Old-timers used to say that a commodity was some-thing that hurt when you dropped it on your foot—gold, sugar, wheat,crude oil. In recent decades many financial instruments began totrade like commodities—currencies, bonds, stock indexes. The termfutures includes traditional commodities along with new financial\ninstruments.\nA future is a contract to deliver or accept delivery of a specific quan-\ntity of a commodity by a certain date. A futures contract is binding onboth buyer and seller. In options the buyer has the right but not anobligation to take delivery. If you buy a call or a put, you can walkaway if you like. In futures, you have no such luxury. If the marketgoes against you, you have to add money to your margin or get out ofyour trade at a loss. Futures are stricter than options but are priced bet-ter for traders.\nBuying a stock makes you a part owner of a company. When you\nbuy a futures contract you don’t own anything, but enter into a bind-ing contract for a future purchase of merchandise, be it a carload ofwheat or a sheaf of Treasury bonds. The person who sells you thatcontract assumes the obligation to deliver. The money you pay for astock goes to the seller, but in futures your margin money stays withthe broker as a security, ensuring you’ll accept delivery when yourcontract comes due. They used to call margin money honest money .\nWhile in stocks you pay interest for margin borrowing, in futures youcan collect interest on your margin.18 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nEach futures contract has a settlement date, with different dates sell-\ning for different prices. Some professionals analyze their differences topredict reversals. Most futures traders do not wait and close out theircontracts early, settling profits and losses in cash. Still, the existence ofa delivery date forces people to act, providing a useful reality check. Aperson may sit on a losing stock for ten years, deluding himself it isonly a paper loss. In futures, reality, in the form of the settlement date,always intrudes on a daydreamer.\nTo understand how futures work, let’s compare a futures trade with\na cash trade—buying or selling a quantity of a commodity outright.Let’s say it’s February and gold is trading at $400 an ounce. Your analy-sis indicates it is likely to rise to $420 within weeks. With $40,000 youcan buy a 100-ounce gold bar from a dealer. If your analysis is correct,in a few weeks your gold will be worth $42,000. You can sell it andmake a $2,000 profit, or 5 percent before commissions—nice. Now let’ssee what happens if you trade futures based on the same analysis.\nSince it is February, April is the next delivery month for gold. One\nfutures contract covers 100 oz. of gold, with a value of $40,000. Themargin on this contract is only $1,000. In other words, you can control$40,000 worth of gold with a $1,000 deposit. If your analysis is correctand gold rallies $20 per oz., you’ll make roughly the same profit as youwould have made had you bought 100 oz. of gold for cash—$2,000.Only now your profit is not 5% but 200%, since your margin was$1,000. Futures can really boost your gains!\nMost people, once they understand how futures work, are flooded\nwith greed. An amateur with $40,000 calls his broker and tells him tobuy 40 contracts! If his analysis is correct and gold rallies to $420, he’llmake $2,000 per contract, or $80,000. He’ll triple his money in a fewweeks! If he repeats this just a few times, he’ll be a millionaire beforethe end of the year! Such dreams of easy money ruin gamblers. What,if anything, do they overlook?\nThe trouble with markets is that they don’t move in straight lines.\nCharts are full of false breakouts, false reversals, and flat trading ranges.Gold may well rise from $400/oz. to $420/oz., but it is perfectly capa-ble of dipping to $390 along the way. That $10 dip would have cre-ated a $1,000 paper loss for someone who bought 100 oz. of gold forcash. For a futures trader who holds a 100 oz. contract on a $1,000 mar-gin that $10 decline represents a total wipeout. Long before he reachesthat sad point, his broker will call and ask for more margin money. IfWHAT MARKETS TO TRADE? 19\n20 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nyou have committed most of your equity to a trade, you’ll have no\nreserves and your broker will sell you out.\nGamblers dream of fat profits, margin themselves to the hilt, and get\nkicked out of the game by the first wiggle that goes against them. Theirlong-term analysis may be right and gold may rise to its target price,but the beginner is doomed because he commits too much of hisequity and has very thin reserves. Futures do not kill traders—poormoney management kills traders.\nFutures can be very attractive for those who have strong money\nmanagement skills. They promise high rates of return but demand ice-cold discipline. When you first approach trading, you are better offwith slower-moving stocks. Once you have matured as a trader, take alook at futures. They may be right for you if you’re very disciplined.We return to the futures markets in Part 2 and look at the best ones forgetting started.\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?Winning in the Futures Markets by George\nAngell is the best introductory book for futures traders. (It is highly supe-rior to all his other books.) The Futures Game by Teweles and Jones is\na mini-encyclopedia that has educated generations of futures traders (besure to get the latest edition). Economics of Futures Trading by Thomas\nA. Hieronymus is probably the most profound book on futures, but it’slong been out of print—try finding a used copy.\nOPTIONS\nAn option is a bet that a specific stock, index, or future will reach orexceed a specific price within a specific time. Please stop and rereadthat sentence. Notice that the word specific occurs in it three times. You\nmust choose the right stock, predict the extent of its move, and fore-cast how fast it’ll get there. You must make three choices—if you’rewrong on just one, you’ll lose money.\nWhen you buy an option, you have to jump through three hoops in\na single leap. You have to be right on the stock or the future, right onits move, and right on its timing. Ever tried tossing a ball through threerings at an amusement park? This triple complexity makes buying op-tions a deadly game.\nOptions offer leverage—an ability to control large positions with a\nsmall outlay of cash. The entire risk of an option is limited to the price\nWHAT MARKETS TO TRADE? 21\nyou pay for it. Options allow traders to make money fast when they’re\nright, but if the market reverses, you can walk away and owe nothing!This is the standard flow of brokerage house propaganda. It attractshordes of small traders who cannot afford to buy stocks but want abigger bang for their buck. What usually gets banged is the optionbuyer’s head.\nMy company, Financial Trading, Inc., has been selling books to\ntraders for years. Whenever a person comes back to buy another book,it is a sign that he is active in the markets. Many clients buy bookson stocks or futures every few months or years. But when a first-timebuyer orders a book on options, he never returns. Why? Does he makeso much money so fast that he doesn’t need another book? Or does hewash out?\nMany beginners buy calls because they can’t afford stocks. Futures\ntraders who get beat up sometimes turn to options on futures. Losersswitch to options instead of dealing with their own inability to trade.Using a shortcut to weasel out of trouble instead of facing a problemnever works.\nSuccessful stock and futures traders sometimes use options to\nreduce risks or protect profits. Serious traders buy options rarely andonly in special situations, as we will see later in this book. Options arehopeless for poor people who use them as substitutes for stocksbecause they can’t afford the real thing.\nProfessionals take full advantage of starry-eyed beginners crowding\ninto options. Their bid-ask spreads are terrible. If an option is bid 75cents, offered at a dollar, you are 25% behind the game as soon as youbuy. The expression “your loss is limited to what you paid for an option”means you can lose 100%! What’s so great about losing everything?\nA client of mine was a market-maker on the floor of the American\nStock Exchange. She came to my classes on technical analysis becauseshe was pregnant and wanted to get off the floor and trade from home.“Options,” she said, “are a hope business. You can buy hope or sell hope.I am a professional—I sell hope. I come to the floor in the morning andfind what the public wants. Then I price that hope and sell it to them.”\nProfessionals are more likely to write options than buy them. Writing\nis a capital-intensive business. You need hundreds of thousands ofdollars to do it right, and most successful options writers operate withmillions. And even theirs is not a risk-free game. Several years ago afriend who used to be one of the nation’s top money managers landed\non the front page of The Wall Street Journal after he lost 20 years’\nworth of profits in a single bad day of writing naked puts.\nThere are two types of option writers. Covered writers buy a stock\nand write an option against it. Naked writers write calls and puts onstocks they don’t own, backing their writes with cash in their accounts.Writing naked options feels like taking money out of thin air, but a vio-lent move can put you out of business. Writing options is a seriousgame, suitable only for disciplined and well-capitalized traders.\nMarkets are like pumps that suck money out of the pockets of the\npoorly informed majority and pump it into the pockets of a savvyminority. People who service those pumps, such as brokers, vendors,regulators, and even janitors who sweep exchange floors, are paidfrom the stream of money flowing through the markets. Since marketstake money from the majority, pay help, and give what’s left to thesavvy minority, the majority, by definition, must lose. You can be surethat whatever the majority of traders does, believes, and says, is notworth doing, believing, and saying. You have to stand apart from thecrowd in order to succeed. Smart traders look for situations where alarge majority does something one way, while a small, moneyedminority goes the opposite way.\nIn options the majority buys calls and, to a lesser degree, puts. The\ninsiders almost exclusively write options. Professionals use their heads,while amateurs are driven by greed and fear. Options take full advan-tage of those feelings.\nGreed is the engine of option-selling propaganda. You must have\nheard the slogan: “Control a large block of stock with just a few dol-lars!” An amateur may be bullish on a $60 stock, but doesn’t have$6,000 to buy 100 shares. He buys some $70 calls with two months oflife left in them for $500 each. If that stock rises to 75, those optionswill acquire $500 of intrinsic value, while maintaining some time value,and a speculator can double his stake in a month! The amateur buyscalls and sits back to watch his money double.\nStrange things begin to happen. Whenever the stock rises two points,\nhis calls go up only one, but when the stock falls or even pauses, hiscalls fall briskly. Instead of seeing his money double in a hurry, theamateur is soon staring at a 50% paper loss, while the clock starts tick-ing louder and louder. The expiration date is nearing, and even thoughthe stock is higher than it was when he bought his calls, they are nowcheaper, showing a paper loss. Should he sell and salvage some money22 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nor hold and wait for a rally? Even if he knows the right thing to do,\nhe’s not going to do it. His greed does him in. He hangs on until hisoptions expire worthless.\nAnother great motivator for buying options is fear, especially in\noptions on futures. A loser takes a few painful hits—his analysis waswet and money management nonexistent. He sees an attractive tradebut fears losing. He hears the siren song—“unlimited gains with lim-ited risk”—and buys options on futures. Speculators buy options likepoor people buy lottery tickets. A person who buys a lottery ticketrisks 100% of what he paid. Any situation where you risk 100% lookslike an odd case of limited risk. Limited to 100%!?! Most speculatorsignore this ominous figure.\nOption buyers have a dismal track record. They may make a few\ndollars on a few trades, but I’ve never seen anyone build equity buy-ing options. The odds in this game are so bad that after a few tradesthey are sure to kick in and destroy a buyer. At the same time, optionshave a high entertainment value. They provide a cheap ticket to thegame, an inexpensive dream, just like a lottery ticket.\nYou need a minimum of one year of successful trading experience in\nstocks or futures before touching options. If you are new to the markets,do not even dream of using options in lieu of stocks. No matter howsmall your account, find some stocks and learn to trade them.\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?The all-time bestseller on options, and\ndeservedly so, is Lawrence MacMillan’s Options as a Strategic Invest-\nment. It is a veritable mini-encyclopedia that covers all aspects of\noptions trading, better than his other book.WHAT MARKETS TO TRADE? 23\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nCHAPTER\nTHREE\nTHE FIRST STEPS\nTrading lures us with its promise of freedom. If you know how to\ntrade, you can live and work anyw here in the w orld, be indepen-\ndent from the routine, and not answer to anybody. Trading attractspeople of above-average intelligence who enjoy games and aren’tafraid of risks. Before you rush into this exciting venture, keep in mindthat in addition to your enthusiasm you will need to bring a soberunderstanding of the realities of trading.\nTrading will stress your feelings. To survive and succeed, you will\nneed to develop a sound trading psychology.\nTrading will challenge your mind. To gain an edge in the markets,\nyou will need to master good analytic methods.\nTrading will demand good mathematical skills. A math illiterate who\ncan’t manage risks is guaranteed to bust out.\nTrading psychology, technical analysis, money management—if you\nlearn all three, you can make it in trading. But first, let us look at theexternal obstacles to your success.\nThe markets are set up to separate the maximum number of peo-\nple from their money. Stealing is not permitted, but markets areheavily slanted in favor of insiders and against outsiders. Let us explorethe barriers that prevent many traders from succeeding and try tolower them.\nTHEEXTERNAL BARRIERS TO SUCCESS\nAn investor can start with practically nothing, buying a few thousanddollars worth of shares. If he buys and holds, his commissions andother expenses will be minor factors in his success or failure. Traders\n25\nhave a harder task. Seemingly trivial expenses can break them, and the\nsmaller the account, the greater the danger. Transaction costs can raisean impassable barrier to winning.\nTransaction costs?!Beginners hardly think of them, yet transaction costs are a leading\ncause of trader mortality. Adjusting your plans to reduce those costsgives you an advantage over the market crowd.\nI have a friend whose 12-year-old daughter recently came up with a\nbrilliant idea for a new business, which she called The Guinea PigFactory. She ran off promotional flyers on her mom’s copy machineand stuffed them into neighbors’ mailboxes. Guinea pigs, popularamong kids in her neighborhood, cost $6, but she could buy themat the central market for only $4. The girl dreamed of profits whenher mother, who is a trader, asked how she was going to get fromthe Sydney suburb where they lived to the central market and back.Someone will give me a ride, answered the girl.\nA child may get a free ride, but the market will not give it to you. If\nyou buy a stock at $4 and sell it at $6, you won’t make a $2 profit. Abig chunk of it will go for transaction costs. Amateurs tend to ignorethem, while professionals focus on them and do everything in theirpower to reduce them—unless they’re collecting them from you, inwhich case they try to blow them up. Beginners get into their GuineaPig Factories and cannot understand why they keep buying at 4, sell-ing at 6, and are still losing money.\nA new trader is like a little lamb walking into a dark forest. He is\nlikely to be killed, and his skin—his trading capital—divided threeways, between brokers, professional traders, and service providers.Each will try to grab a piece of that poor lamb’s skin. Don’t be thatlamb—think of transaction costs. There are three kinds of them: com-missions, slippage, and expenses.\nCommissions\nCommissions may appear to be a minuscule expense. Most tradersneglect them, but if you add them up, you’re likely to find that yourbroker ends up with much of your profit.\nA brokerage firm may charge about $20 to buy or sell up to 5,000\nshares. If you have a $20,000 account and buy 200 shares of a $100stock, the commission of $20 comes to one-tenth of one percent. When26 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nyou sell those shares and pay another commission, the cost of broker-\nage rises to approximately two-tenths of one percent of your equity.Trade like that once a week, and at the end of the month your brokerwill have earned one percent of your account, regardless of whether youmade money. Keep going like that for a year, and your commission costwill rise to 12% of your equity. That’s a lot of money. Professional moneymanagers are happy with 25% annual returns, year after year. They couldnot generate them if they had to pay 12% annually in commissions.\nBut wait, it gets worse.Look at a small trader who can afford only 100 shares of a $20 stock.\nHis purchase price is $2,000, but he pays the same $20 commission, whicheats up a whopping 1 percent of his equity. When he closes that trade andpays another commission, he is 2 percent behind the game. If he tradeslike that once a week, by the end of the month his commissions willcome to 10% of his account, more than 100% on annualized basis. Thegreat George Soros averages 29% annual gain. He could have neveraccomplished that if he had to jump over a 100% commission barrier.\nThe bigger your account, the smaller the percentage eaten by com-\nmissions and the lower your barrier to winning. Having a large accountis a great advantage, but whatever your size, do not be hyperactive.Each trade and each seemingly cheap commission raise the barrier toyour success. Design a system that doesn’t trade very often.\nI’ve met futures traders who paid $80 roundtrip commissions to full-\nservice brokers. That was the price of allegedly sage advice, but any dis-interested professional will tell you that a futures trader who pays $80roundtrip has no chance of winning. Why do people pay such exorbi-tant rates? Because the little lamb who ventures into a dark forest is soafraid of the big bad wolf, the professional trader, that he hires himselfa protector to guide him, a full-service broker. Once you do the math,it becomes clear that you’re better off taking your chances on the wolfthan signing up for a guaranteed skinning by your protector.\nThere are full-service brokers whose advice is worth the money.\nThey bring good tips, get good fills, and their commissions are notexorbitant. The catch is that they only accept very large accounts thatgenerate a high volume of business. Bring them a million-dollar accountwith a history of active trading, and you may get their attention.\nIf you have an account in five or six figures and trade only a cou-\nple of times a week, do not waste your time and money looking forfalse security of an expensive broker. Get a cheap, reliable, no-frillsTHE FIRST STEPS 27\nbroker that you can easily reach via the Internet or on the phone—and\nstart looking for good trades.\nSlippage\nSlippage is the difference between the price at the time you placedyour order and the price at which that order got filled. You may placean order to buy when a guinea pig is trading at $4, but your bill comesto $4.25. How come? Then the guinea pig goes up to $6 and you placean order to sell at the market, only to receive $5.75. Why? In our dailylives we are used to paying posted prices. Here, at the grown-upGuinea Pig Factory, they clip you for a quarter buying and another sell-ing. It could get worse. Those quarters and halves can add up to asmall fortune for a moderately active trader. Who gets that money?Slippage is one of the key sources of income for market professionals,which is why they tend to be very hush-hush about it.\nNo stock, future, or option has a set price, but it does have two rap-\nidly changing prices—a bid and an ask. A bid is what a buyer is offer-ing to pay, whereas an ask is what a seller is asking. A professional ishappy to accommodate an eager buyer, selling to him instantly, on thespot—at a price slightly higher than the latest trade in that market. Agreedy trader who’s afraid that the bullish train is leaving the stationoverpays a pro who lets him have his stock right away. That pro offersa similar service to sellers. If you want to sell without waiting, afraidthat prices may collapse, a professional will buy from you on thespot—at a price slightly lower than the latest trade in that market.Anxious sellers accept ridiculously low prices. Slippage depends on theemotional state of market participants.\nThe professional who sells to buyers and buys from sellers is not a\nsocial worker. He is running a business, not a charitable operation.Slippage is the price he charges for rapid action. He has paid a highprice for his spot at the crossroads of buy and sell orders, buying orleasing an exchange seat or installing expensive equipment.\nSome orders are slippage-proof, while others invite slippage. The\nthree most popular types of orders are limit, market, and stop. A limitorder specifies the price; that is, “Buy 100 shares of Guinea Pig Factoryat $4.” If the market is quiet and you’re willing to wait, you’ll get thatprice. If GPF dips below $4 by the time your order hits the market, youmay get it a little cheaper, but don’t count on it. If the market rises28 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nabove $4, your limit order will not be filled. A limit order lets you con-\ntrol the price at which you buy or sell, but doesn’t guarantee you a fill.\nA market order lets you buy or sell immediately, at whatever price\nyou can get at the moment. The execution is guaranteed, but not theprice. If you want to buy or sell right away, this very moment, you can-not expect to get the best price—you give up control and suffer slip-page. Market orders placed by anxious traders are the bread and butterof the pros.\nA stop order becomes a market order when the market touches that\nlevel. Suppose you buy 100 shares of Guinea Pig Factory at $4.25,expect it to rise to $7, but protect your position with a stop at $3.75.If the price slides to $3.75, your stop becomes a market order, executedas soon as possible. You’ll get out, but expect to suffer slippage in afast-moving market.\nYou can choose what you want to control when you place an\norder—the price or the time. A limit order lets you control the price,with no assurance of a fill. When you place a market order, a fill isassured, but not the price. A calm and patient trader prefers to use limitorders, since those who use market orders keep losing slivers of capi-tal in slippage.\nSlippage tends to be a much bigger expense than commissions. I esti-\nmated the size of both in Trading for a Living and thought this was one\nof the most explosive parts of the book, but very few noticed. People inthe grip of greed or fear want to trade at any price, rather than focus ontheir long-term financial interests. So much for the efficient market theory.\nThere are day-trading firms promising to teach traders to take advan-\ntage of slippage by trading inside the bid-ask spreads. Their technol-ogy does not guarantee success, while commissions from active tradingnegate any advantage. People pay a lot of money for Level 2 quotes,but I haven’t noticed any great increase in performance among thosewho use them.\nGetting into a trade is like jumping into a fast-moving river. The\nopportunity as well as the danger is in the water. You are safe stand-ing on the bank and can control where and when to jump, but gettingout of the water can be more tricky. You may see a spot where youwant to get out—a profit target, where you can place a limit order.You may want to let the river carry you as long as the current allows,protecting your position with a trailing stop. That may increase yourprofits, but it also will increase slippage.THE FIRST STEPS 29\nLimit orders work best for entering trades. You’ll miss a trade once\nin a while, but there will be many others. That river has been flowingfor hundreds of years. A serious trader uses limit orders to get in andto take profits, and protects his positions with stops. Anything we cando to reduce slippage goes directly to our bottom line and improvesour odds of long-term success.\nExpenses\nSome expenses are unavoidable, especially in the beginning—you’ll haveto buy a few books, download trading software, sign up with a data serv-ice, and so on. It is important to keep your expenses as low as possible.Amateurs have a charming habit of paying for their trading-relatedexpenses, such as computers, subscriptions, and advisory services, withcredit cards, without taking money out of their trading accounts. Thatprotects them from seeing the true rate at which they are going downhill.\nGood traders add to profitable positions and reduce the size of their\ntrades during losing streaks. We can apply the same sound principleto expenditures. Losers like to throw money at problems, while winnersinvest a fraction of their profits in their operations. Successful traderstreat themselves to a new computer or software package only afterthey have enough profit to pay for it.\nEven the best tools can blow you out of the water. At a recent sem-\ninar in Frankfurt, a trader was excited about a powerful analytic pack-age for which he was going to sign up the following week. It cost 2,000marks a month (almost $1,000), but it was going to give him a tremen-dous analytic advantage. “How much money do you have in yourtrading account?” I asked. 50,000 marks. “Then you can’t afford it. Thissoftware will cost you 24,000 marks a year, and you’ll have to gener-ate almost 50% profit simply to pay for your signals. No matter howgood the software, at this rate you’ll lose money. Look for a cheaperpackage, something that’ll cost no more than 1,000 marks per year, orabout 2% of your account.”\nInstitutional traders get support from their managers, peers, and staff,\nbut private traders tend to feel lonely and isolated. Vendors prey on themby promising to help lead them out of the wilderness. The more over-loaded you feel, the more likely you are to listen to vendors. Nine outof ten professionals in any field, be they lawyers, auto mechanics, ordoctors, are not good enough. You don’t trust an average auto mechanic30 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nor a doctor, but rather ask for referrals from friends you respect. Most\nprivate traders do not know who to ask and respond to advisors withthe loudest advertisements, who are rarely the best trading experts.\nAn advisor I’ve known for years was recently indicted by the Feds\nfor stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from Japanese clients. Priorto that, he cultivated a reputation as one of the most prominent mar-ket experts in the United States, constantly quoted by the media. Wewere introduced at a conference, where people paid thousands of dol-lars to listen to him. He asked me what I thought of his presentation,and I said it sounded amazingly interesting but I could not understandmuch of it. “That’s the point,” he beamed. “If my clients believe I knowsomething they don’t, I’ve got them for life!” I knew right away theman was dishonest, and was surprised only by the size of his loot.\nSome trading advice can be amazingly good. A few dollars will buy you\na book that holds the experience of a lifetime. A few hundred dollars willget you a subscription to a newsletter with original and helpful advice. Butgems are few and far between, while legions of hucksters prey on inse-cure traders. I have two rules for filtering out the worst offenders: avoidservices you don’t understand and avoid expensive services.\nIf you don’t understand an advisor, stay away from him. Trading\nattracts people of above-average intelligence, which probably appliesto you. If you cannot understand something after an honest effort, it’sprobably because the other guy is giving you double-talk. When itcomes to books, I avoid those written in bad English. Language is areflection of thought, and if a guy cannot write clearly, his thinkingprobably isn’t too clear either. I also avoid books with no bibliography.We all borrow from our predecessors, and an author who doesn’tacknowledge his debts is either arrogant, lazy, or both. Those are terri-ble traits in a trader, and if he writes like that, I don’t want his advice.And of course, I have zero respect for thieves. Book titles are not copy-righted, and in recent years a bunch of people have lifted the title ofmy first book, Trading for a Living , usually with slight variations. I am\nsure that some clown will steal the title of the book you’re now read-ing. Will you want to learn from a poacher who cannot think for himself?\nMy second rule is to avoid very expensive services, be they books,\nadvisory letters, or seminars. A $200 newsletter is likely to be a bettervalue than a $2,000 one, and a $500 seminar a better value than a$5,000 one. Merchants of super-expensive products sell an implicitpromise of “the keys to the kingdom.” Their customers are usuallyTHE FIRST STEPS 31\ndesperate to dig out from under abysmal losses. Football players call\nthis a “Hail Mary” play—when a losing team in the last seconds of thegame desperately tosses the ball forward, hoping to score. They’vealready lost the game on skill, and now try to come back in a singledesperate gamble. When a trader who lost more than half of hisaccount buys a $3,000 trading system, he is doing the same thing.\nHelpful advisors tend to be modest, and price their services accord-\ningly. An obscene price is a marketing gimmick that conveys a sub-liminal message that the service is magic. There is no magic—no onecan deliver on that promise. A relatively inexpensive service is a bar-gain when it’s good, and a cheap loss when it isn’t.\nSomeone once asked Sigmund Freud what he thought the best attitude\nfor a patient was. “Benign skepticism,” answered the great psychiatrist,and that’s good advice for financial traders. Maintain an attitude of healthyskepticism. If you find something you don’t understand, try it again, andif you still do not get it, it is probably not worth having. Run, do not walk,from those who offer to sell you the keys to the kingdom. Keep yourexpenses low and remember, any information you receive becomes valu-able to you only after you’ve tested it on your data, making it your own.\nGETTING YOURGEAR\nA successful trader is like a fish swimming upstream, against thecurrent. Commissions, slippage, and expenses keep pushing you back.You must make enough money to overshoot these three barriers beforemaking a dime.\nThere is no shame in deciding trading is too hard and walking away,\njust as there is no shame in being unable to dance or play the piano.Many beginners jump in without thinking and get financially and emo-tionally hurt. It is a great game, but if you leave, better do it early.\nIf you decide to trade, read on, because in the following sections we\nwill look into psychology, trading tactics, and money management. Butfirst, we must talk about the practical aspects of trading—how to openan account, choose a computer, and start collecting data.\nSize Matters\nMaking or losing money in the market depends in part on how muchyou put into your account. Two people can take identical trades, but one32 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nwill grow equity, while the other will bust out. How could this be if they\nbuy and sell the same quantity of the same stock at the same time?\nSuppose we meet and decide to pass an hour tossing a coin, playing\nheads-or-tails—heads you win, tails you lose. Each of us will bring $5to the game and bet 25 cents on each flip. As long as we use a fair coin,by the end of the hour we will be about even, each with about $5.\nWhat happens if we play the same game and use the same coin,\nonly now you start with $5, while I bring only $1? You’ll probably endup taking my money. You are likely to win because your capital pro-vides greater staying power. It would take a string of 20 losses to bank-rupt you, while for me a string of just 4 losses would be fatal. Fourlosses in a row are much more likely than 20. The trouble with a smallaccount is that it has no reserves to survive even a short run of losingtrades. Winning trades are always interlaced with losers, and a shortlosing streak wipes out small traders.\nMost beginners start out with too little money. There is plenty of\nnoise in the markets—random moves that defy trading systems. A smalltrader who runs into a noisy period has no safety cushion. His long-term analysis may be brilliant, but the market will do him in, becausehe does not have the staying power to ride out a losing streak.\nBack in 1980, as a greenhorn amateur, I walked into a Chase bank\naround the corner and drew a $5,000 cash advance against my creditcard. I needed that princely sum to meet a margin call in my depletedtrading account. A beady-eyed cashier called the manager, whodemanded my thumbprint on the receipt. The transaction felt dirty, butI got the money—which I proceeded to lose within a few months. Mysystem was correct, but the market noise was killing me. It wasn’t untilI got my trading account into a comfortable high five figures that Istarted making money. I wish someone had explained the concept ofsize to me in those days.\nTrading a small account is like flying an airplane at treetop level.\nYou have no room to maneuver, no time to think. The slightest slip ofattention, a piece of bad luck, a freaky branch sticking out into theair—you crash and burn. The higher you fly, the more time you haveto find your way out of trouble. Flying at a low altitude is toughenough for experts, but deadly for beginners. A trader needs to gainaltitude, get more equity, and buy some space for maneuvers.\nA person with a large account who bets a small fraction on any\ngiven trade can stay calm. A person with a small account grows tenseTHE FIRST STEPS 33\nknowing that any single trade can either boost or damage his account.\nAs the stress rises, the capacity to reason goes down.\nI saw the best example of how money can twist a player’s mind\nwhile teaching my oldest daughter to play backgammon. She was abouteight at the time but very determined and bright. After a few months ofpractice she began beating me. Then I suggested we play for money—a penny a point, which in our scoring meant a maximum of 32 centsper game. She kept beating me, and I kept raising the stakes. By thetime we reached 10 cents a point she started losing and soon gave backevery last penny. Why could she beat me playing for little or no moneybut lost when the stakes increased? Because for me $3.20 was pocketchange, but for the kid it was real money. Thinking about it made hera little more tense and she played slightly below her peak level—enough to fall behind. A trader with a small account is so preoccupiedwith money that it impairs his ability to think, play, and win.\nOther beginners bring too much money to the game, and that is not\ngood either. A beginner with too much capital goes chasing after toomany rabbits, becomes careless, loses track of his positions, and endsup losing money.\nHow much should you have in your trading account when you start?\nRemember, we are talking about trading capital. It doesn’t include yoursavings, long-term investments, retirement funds, house equity, orChristmas club. We only count the money that you want to spin in themarkets, aiming to achieve a higher rate of return than you can getfrom Treasury bills.\nDo not even dream of starting with less than $20,000. That is the\nbarest minimum, but $50,000 provides a much safer flying altitude. Itallows you to diversify and practice sensible money management. Atthe same time, I do not suggest starting with more than $100,000. Toomuch money in a trading account makes a beginner lose focus andleads to sloppy trading. Professionals can use a lot more, but begin-ners should stay below $100,000 while learning to trade. Learn to fly asingle-engine plane before moving up to a twin-engine model. A suc-cessful trader needs to get into the habit of being careful with money.\nBeginners sometimes ask me what to do if they have only $10,000\nor $5,000. I urge them to study the markets and paper-trade, while get-ting a second job to accumulate capital. Start trading with a decent-sized account. You’re going into battle, your capital is your sword, and34 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nyou need a weapon that’s long enough to give you a chance in com-\nbat with well-armed opponents.\nHardware and Software\nThinking about my first purchases of trading technology is pure nos-talgia. I walked into a drugstore in Florida and bought a pocket calcu-lator. A year later I acquired a programmable calculator with a tiny engine\nthat pulled magnetic memory cards through its slot. Then I bought myfirst computer. It had two floppy drives—one for the program, theother for the data diskette. I upgraded it from 48K to 64K RAM (that’skilobytes, not megabytes!), and it was a rocket. My first modem col-lected data at a brisk 300 baud, later upgraded to a sizzling 1,200.When hard drives became available, I bought myself a 10-MB unit(they also had a 20-MB model, but who needed such a monster?).There was only one good program for technical analysis, and it cost$1,900. Today, I can buy a hundred times more powerful software fora tenth of that price.\nDoes every trader need a computer? My friend Lou Taylor did all his\nresearch on scraps of paper. I used to offer him computers, but to noavail. Most traders, including myself, would be lost without a computer.It expands our reach and speeds up research. Just keep in mind thatcomputers do not guarantee profits. Technology helps, but does notguarantee victory. A poor driver will crash the best car.\nTo become a computerized trader, you must choose a computer,\ntrading software, and a source of data. Trading programs tend to beundemanding and run well on older, slower machines. A good pro-gram for technical analysis must download the data, plot daily, weekly,and possibly intraday charts, and offer a multitude of indicators. Agood program should allow you to add your own indicators to the sys-tem and let you scan lists of securities according to your parameters.The list of programs for traders keeps growing, so that by the time youread this book any review will be out of date. My company keepsupdating our brief software guide, which we send out as a public ser-vice. To request a current copy, please contact us at the address thatappears in the back of this book.\nA striking development in recent years is the wealth of resources for\ntraders available on the Internet. Today you can analyze markets with-THE FIRST STEPS 35\nout buying any software—just go to a website, key in your stocks or\nfutures, select the indicators, and click your mouse. Some websites arefree, while others are subscription-based. With all those websites, whybuy technical analysis software? For the same reason that in a city likeNew York, with its good public transportation system, some of us owncars. Clients often ask me how to add some new indicator to theirfavorite website. When you travel by bus, you cannot ask the driver totake your favorite route.\nCan you program your own indicator into a website and scan charts\nwith it, posting green dots for buy signals and red dots for sell signals?When you find a website that can do it, you may no longer need soft-ware. Until that time, those of us who are serious about research willcontinue to buy technical analysis software. You can get a top-notchprogram for a few hundred dollars. A historical database with a year’sworth of updates will cost a couple of hundred more. If you have atiny account, however, use free websites. Always try to push yourexpenses down to the smallest possible percentage of your account.\nData\nSigning up with a data service appears simple, but raises several ques-tions that go to the heart of trading. How many markets should youfollow? How far back should you go in your research? Do you needreal-time data? Answering these questions takes you deep into the trad-ing enterprise and forces you to review your decision-making process.\nHow Many Markets Should You Follow? Beginners make the com-\nmon mistake of trying to follow too many markets at once. Some lookfor software to scan thousands of stocks and quickly bog down.Serious beginners should pick no more than two or three dozen stocksand track them day in and day out. You need to get to know them,develop a feel for how they move. Do you know when your compa-nies release their earnings? Do you know their highest and lowestprices for the past year? The more you know about a stock, the moreconfidence you have and the fewer surprises can jump out at you.Many professionals focus on just a few stocks, or even on a single one.\nWhich stocks should you track? Begin by choosing two or three cur-\nrently hot industries. Technology, Internet, telecommunications, andbiotechnology industries are in the forefront of the market at the time36 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nof this writing, but the list is likely to change. It always does. Pick half\na dozen leading stocks in each of those industries and follow themdaily. That’s where you’ll find the highest volumes, the steadiest trends,the crispest reversals. Several months later, after you get to know yourstocks and make some money, you may be ready to add anotherindustry group and pick its top six stocks. Remember, the depth ofyour research is much more important than its breadth. You can makemore money from a handful of familiar stocks.\nThe choice is easier for futures traders—there are only about three\ndozen futures, in six or seven groups. Beginners should stay away fromthe most volatile markets. Take grains, for instance. You should analyzecorn, wheat, and soybeans, but trade only corn because it tends to bethe slowest and quietest of the group. Learn to ride a bicycle with train-ing wheels before starting to race. When it comes to tropicals, analyzeall, but trade only sugar—a big, liquid, and reasonably volatile market,leaving aside coffee and cocoa, which can move as fast as the S&P.Needless to say, a beginner has no business with stock index futures,whose nickname on the floor is “rockets.” You may graduate to them ina couple of years, but at this stage, if you have an opinion on the stockmarket, trade SPDRs or QQQs, exchange-traded market indexes.\nHow Far Back Should You Go in Your Research? A daily chart on a\ncomputer screen will comfortably show five or six months of history.You’ll see less with candlesticks (see p. 72), which take up more space.Daily charts alone aren’t enough, and you need weekly charts with atleast two years worth of history. Learning history prepares you for thefuture, and it could be helpful to glance at a 10-year chart and seewhether that market is high or low in the long-term scheme of things.\nCharts spanning 20 or more years are especially useful for futures\ntraders. Futures, unlike stocks, have natural floors and ceilings. Thoselevels are not rigid, but before you buy or sell, try to find out whetheryou’re closer to the floor or the ceiling.\nThe floor price of futures is their cost of production. When a market\nfalls below that level, producers start quitting, supply falls, and pricesrise. If there is a glut of sugar and its price on the world markets fallsbelow what it costs to grow the stuff, major producers are going to startshutting down their operations. There are exceptions, such as when adesperately poor country sells commodities on the world markets toearn hard currency, while paying domestic workers with devaluedTHE FIRST STEPS 37\nlocal money. The price can dip below the cost of production, but it\ncannot stay there for long.\nThe ceiling for most commodities is the cost of substitution. One\ncommodity can replace another if the price is right. For example, witha rise in the price of corn, a major animal feed, it may be cheaper tofeed animals wheat. As more farmers switch and reduce corn pur-chases, they take away the fuel that raised corn prices. A market in thegrip of hysteria may briefly rise above its ceiling, but cannot stay therefor long. Its return to the normal range provides profit opportunitiesfor savvy traders. Learning from history can help you keep calm whenothers are losing their heads.\nFutures contracts expire every few months, making long-term charts\ndifficult to analyze. When it comes to dailies, we look at the currentlyactive month, but what about the weeklies? Here we have to use con-tinuous contracts, mathematical devices that splice several contractmonths. It pays to download two data series—the currently active con-tract, going back about six months, and the continuous contract goingback at least two years. Analyze weekly charts using continuous data,and switch to the front month to study daily charts.\nDo You Need Real-Time Data? Real-time data flows to your screen\ntick by tick, as prices change in the markets. A live screen is one of themost captivating sights on Earth, right up there with nude co-ed volley-ball or a chain collision on an expressway. Watching your stock dancein front of your face can help you find the best spots for buying andselling—or make you forget reality and swim in adrenaline.\nWill live data improve your trading? The answer is “yes” for a few,\n“maybe” for some, and “no” for most. Having a live screen on yourdesk, says a trader friend, is like sitting in front of a one-armed bandit.You invariably end up feeding it quarters.\nTrading with live charts looks deceptively easy, while in fact it is one\nof the fastest games on the planet. Buy at 10:05 \nA.M., watch the price rise\na few ticks, and take a couple of hundred dollars off the table by 10:15.Repeat several times a day, and go home at 4 with thousands of dol-lars and no open positions. Sleep like a baby and return in the morn-ing. Trouble is, you need perfect reflexes to do that. If you pause tothink, delay taking a profit, or quibble accepting a loss, you’re dead.\nMost successful day-traders are men in their early 20s. I’ve met very few\nsuccessful day-traders over 30. There are exceptions, of course—a friend38 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nin her 70s is a fantastic day-trader, but she is an exception who confirms\nthe rule. This game requires lightning-fast reflexes, as well as a certainthoughtless capacity to jump, that few of us preserve past the age of 30.\nBeginners do not need live data because they have to put all their\nattention into learning to trade with daily and weekly charts. Once youstart pulling money out of the markets, it might be a good idea to applyyour new skills to intraday charts. When longer-term charts give you abuy or a sell signal, use live data not to day-trade but to dance into orout of positions.\nOnce you decide to use live data, make sure it’s real and not de-\nlayed. Most exchanges charge monthly fees for real-time data, while theInternet is full of websites offering free data, delayed by 20 minutes.That delay does not interfere with the entertainment value, but tradingwith it is suicidal. If you need real-time data, be sure to get the best.\nANALYSIS AND TRADING\nMarkets generate vast volumes of information: annual and quarterlyreports, earnings estimates, corporate insiders’ reports, industry groupstudies, technology forecasts, weekly, daily, and intraday charts, tech-nical indicators, trading volume, opinions in chat rooms, the never-ending discussion circles on the Internet. With so much data, you soonrealize your analysis can never be complete.\nSome traders who have lost money fall into paralysis from analysis.\nThey develop a quaint notion that if they analyze more data, they’llstop losing and become winners. You can recognize them by theirbeautiful charts and shelves crammed with stock reports. They willshow you indicator signals in the middle of any chart, but when youask them what they will do at the right edge, they only mumblebecause they do not trade.\nAnalysts are paid to be right; traders are paid to be profitable. Those\nare two different goals, calling for different temperaments. Institutionstend to separate traders and analysts into different departments. Privatetraders have no such luxury.\nAnalysis quickly reaches the point of diminishing returns. The goal\nis not to be complete but to develop a decision-making process andback it up with money management. You need to develop severalanalytic screens to reduce a huge volume of market information to amanageable size.THE FIRST STEPS 39\nFundamental Analysis\nFundamental analysts predict price movements on the basis of supply\nand demand. In stocks, they study supply and demand for companyproducts. In futures they research supply and demand for commodities.\nHas a company announced a new technological breakthrough? An\nexpansion abroad? A new strategic partnership? A new chief executive?Anything that happens to the business can influence the supply of itsproducts and their costs. Almost everything that happens in society caninfluence the demand.\nFundamental analysis is hard because the importance of different\nfactors changes with the passage of time. For example, during an eco-nomic expansion, fundamental analysts are likely to focus on growthrates, but during a recession, on the safety of dividends. A dividendmay seem like a quaint relic in a go-go bull market, but when the chipsare down the ultimate test of a stock is how much income it generates.A fundamental analyst must keep an eye on the crowd, as it shifts itsattention from market share to technological innovation to whateverelse preoccupies it at the moment. Fundamental analysts study values,but the relationship between values and prices is not direct. It’s thatmile-long rubber band all over again.\nThe job of a fundamental analyst in the futures markets isn’t much\neasier. How do you read the actions of the Federal Reserve, with itsgreat power over interest rates and the economy? How do you ana-lyze weather reports during the critical growing seasons in the grainmarkets? How do you estimate carryover stocks and weather pros-pects in the Southern versus the Northern Hemispheres which are sixmonths apart in their weather cycles? You can spend a lifetime learn-ing the fundamentals, or you can look for capable people who selltheir research.\nFundamental analysis is much more narrow than technical. A mov-\ning average works similarly in soybeans and IBM, on weekly, daily,and intraday charts. MACD-Histogram flashes similar messages inTreasury bonds and Intel. Should we forget about the fundamentalsand concentrate on technicals? Many traders take the path of leastresistance, but I think this is a mistake.\nFundamental factors are very important to a long-term trader who\nwants to ride major trends for several months or years. If the funda-mentals are bullish, we should favor the long side of the market, and40 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nif bearish, the short side. Fundamental analysis is less relevant to a\nshort-term trader or a day-trader.\nYou do not have to become an expert in the fundamental analysis\nof every stock and commodity. There are very intelligent people whospecialize in that, and they publish their research. Many of them alsobang their heads against the walls, unable to understand why, if theyknow so much about their markets, they cannot make money trading.\nIf we can take our ideas from fundamental analysts but filter them\nthrough technical screens, we’ll be miles of head of those who analyzeonly fundamentals or technicals. Bullish fundamentals must be con-firmed by rising technical indicators; otherwise they are suspect.Bearish fundamentals must be confirmed by falling technical indicators.When fundamentals and technicals are in gear, a savvy trader can havea field day.\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?The main book on the fundamental analysis\nof stocks is Security Analysis by Graham and Dodd. Both authors are long\ndead, but the book is being kept up-to-date by their disciples. If youdecide to study it, make sure to get the latest edition. Warren Buffett, astudent of Graham, became one of the richest men in the world. Thereis an easy-to-read book that explains his approach to fundamental analy-sis—The Buffett Way by Robert G. Hagstrom.\nThe best review of futures fundamentals is in The Futures Game by\nTeweles and Jones. This classic volume is being revised and updatedevery 10 years or so (be sure to get the latest edition). It has a sectionon the fundamentals of every futures market. Whether you trade soy-beans or Swiss francs, you can quickly read up on the key factors driv-ing that market.\nTechnical Analysis\nFinancial markets run on a two-party system—bulls and bears. Bullspush prices up, bears push them down, while charts show us theirfootprints. Technical analysts study charts to find where one groupoverpowers the other. They look for repetitive price patterns, trying torecognize uptrends or downtrends in their early stages and generatebuy or sell signals.\nThe role of technical analysis on Wall Street has changed over the\nyears. It was very popular in the early part of the twentieth century,THE FIRST STEPS 41\nushered in by Charles Dow, the founder of The Wall Street Journal\nand the originator of the Dow averages. Several prominent analysts,such as Roger Babson, predicted and identified the 1929 top. Then camea quarter century of exile, when institutional analysts had to hide theircharts if they wanted to keep their jobs. Technical analysis has becomehugely popular since the 1980s. Easy access to personal computers hasput technical software within easy reach of traders.\nThe stock market has become increasingly short-term oriented in\nrecent years. Gone are the days of “buy-and-hold” when people bought“good stocks” for the long run, put them away, and collected divi-dends. The pace of economic change is increasing, and stocks are mov-ing faster and faster. New industries emerge, old ones sink, and manystocks have become more volatile than commodities. Technical analy-sis is well suited for those fast-paced changes.\nThere are two main types of technical analysis: classical and com-\nputerized. Classical analysis is based solely on the study of charts, with-out using anything more complex than a pencil and ruler. Classicaltechnicians look for uptrends and downtrends, support and resistancezones, as well as repetitive patterns, such as triangles and rectangles.It is an easy field to enter, but its main drawback is subjectivity. Whena classical technician feels bullish, his ruler tends to inch up, and whenhe feels bearish, that ruler tends to slide down.\nModern technical analysis relies on computerized indicators whose\nsignals are much more objective. The two main types are trend-following indicators and oscillators. Trend-following indicators, such asmoving averages, Directional System, and MACD (moving averageconvergence-divergence), help identify trends. Oscillators, such as Stochas-tic, Force Index, and Relative Strength Index (RSI) help identify reversals.It is important to select several indicators from both groups, set theirparameters, and stay with them. Amateurs often misuse technical analy-sis by looking for indicators that show them what they want to see.\nThe main tool of technical analysis is neither the pencil nor the com-\nputer, but the organ that every analyst is supposed to have between hisears—the brain. Still, if two technicians are at the same level of devel-opment, the one with a computer has an advantage.\nTechnical analysis is partly a science and partly an art—partly objec-\ntive and partly subjective. It relies on computerized methods, but ittracks crowd psychology, which can never be fully objective. The bestmodel for technical analysis is a public opinion poll. Pollsters use sci-entific methods but need psychological flair to design questions and42 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nselect polling techniques. Price patterns on our computer screens\nreveal crowd behavior. Technical analysis is applied social psychology,the craft of analyzing mass behavior for profit.\nMany beginners, overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data, fall into\nthe trap of automatic trading systems. Their vendors claim to havebacktested the best technical tools and put them together into winningsystems. Whenever an excited beginner tells me he is planning to buyan automatic system, I ask him what he does for a living and whatwould happen if I came to compete with him after buying an automaticdecision-making system in his field. People want to believe in magic,and if that magic can also save them from working and thinking, theygladly pay good money for it.\nSuccessful trading is based on the 3 M’s—Mind, Method, Money.\nTechnical analysis, no matter how clever, is responsible for only one-third of your success. You also need to have sound trading psychologyand proper money management, as you’ll see later in this book.\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?Technical Analysis of Stock Trends by\nEdwards and Magee, written in the first half of the twentieth century,is considered the definitive book on classical charting. Get any editionafter 1955, because that was the last major revision of the book.Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets by John Murphy offers the\nmost thorough review of modern as well as classical technical analy-sis. My first book, Trading for a Living , has large sections on both clas-\nsical and modern technical analysis.\nWhen to Buy and Sell\nThe secret of trading is that there is no secret. There is no magic pass-word to profits. Beginners keep looking for a gimmick, and plenty ofcrafty vendors sell them. In truth, trading is about work—and a bit offlair. It is no different from any other field of human endeavor. Whetheryou do surgery, teach calculus, or fly an airplane, it all boils down toknowing the rules, having the discipline, putting in the work, and hav-ing a bit of flair.\nAn intelligent trader pays attention to fundamentals. He is aware of\nthe key forces in the economy. He spends most of his analytic timeon technical analysis, working to identify trends and reversals. Laterin this book we will review key technical tools and put together atrading plan.THE FIRST STEPS 43\nMarkets keep changing, and flexibility is the name of the game. A\nbrilliant programmer told me recently that he kept losing money butwhoever was buying off of his stops must have been profitable becausehis stops kept nailing the bottoms of declines. I asked why he didn’tstart placing his buy orders where he now placed stops. He wouldn’tdo it because he was too rigid, and for him buy orders were buy ordersand stops were stops. A high level of education can be a handicap intrading. Brian Monieson, a noted Chicago trader, once said in an inter-view, “I have a Ph.D. in mathematics and a background in cybernetics,but I was able to overcome those disadvantages and make money.”\nMany professional people are preoccupied with being right. Engineers\nbelieve that everything can be calculated, and doctors believe that ifthey run enough tests, they’ll come up with the right diagnosis andtreatment. Curing a patient involves a lot more than precision. It is arunning joke how many doctors and lawyers lose money in the mar-kets. Why? Certainly not for lack of intelligence, but for lack of humil-ity and flexibility.\nMarkets operate in an atmosphere of uncertainty. Trading signals are\nclear in the middle of the chart, but as you get closer to the right edge,you find yourself in what John Keegan, the great military historian,called “the fog of war.” There is no certainty, only odds. Here you havetwo goals—to make money and to learn. Win or lose, you have to gainknowledge from a trade in order to be a better trader tomorrow. Scanyour fundamental information, read technical signals, implement yourrules of money management and risk control. Now you are ready topull the trigger. Go!44 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nPART\nTWO\nTHE THREE M’S\nOF SUCCESSFULTRADING\nBuy low, sell high. Short high, cover low. Traders are like surfers,\ntrying to catch good waves, only their beach is rocky, not sandy.\nProfessionals wait for opportunities but amateurs jump in, driven byemotions—they keep buying strength and selling weakness, bleedingtheir equity into the markets. Buy low, sell high sounds like a simplerule, but greed and fear can override the best intentions.\nA professional waits for familiar patterns to emerge from the market.\nHe may notice a new trend with rising momentum, indicating higherprices ahead. Or he may detect the feebleness of momentum during arally, indicating weakness. Once he recognizes a pattern, he puts ona trade. He has a clear notion of how he’ll get in, where he’ll take prof-its, and where he’ll accept a loss if the market turns against him.\nA trade is a bet on a price change, but there is a paradox. Each price\nreflects the latest consensus of value of market participants. Putting ona trade challenges that consensus. A buyer disagrees with the collectivewisdom by saying the market is underpriced. A seller disagrees with thewisdom of the entire group, believing the market is overpriced. Boththe buyer and the seller expect the consensus to change, but meanwhilethey defy the market. That market includes some of the most brilliantminds and some of the deepest pockets on Earth. Arguing with thisgroup is dangerous business, and it has to be done very cautiously.\nAn intelligent trader looks for holes in the efficient market theory.\nHe scans the market for brief periods of inefficiency. When the crowdis gripped by greed, the newcomers jump in and load up on stocks.\nWhen falling prices squeeze the fingers of thousands of buyers, they\ndump their holdings in a panic, disregarding fundamental values. Thoseepisodes of emotional behavior dilute the cold efficiency of the mar-ket, creating opportunities for disciplined traders. When markets arecalm and efficient, trading becomes a crapshoot, with commissions andslippage worsening the odds.\nCrowd mentality changes slowly, and price patterns recur, albeit\nwith variations. Emotional swings provide trading opportunities, whileefficient markets chop up and down, offering no edge to traders, onlypiling up their costs. Technical analysis tools will work for you only ifyou have the discipline to wait for patterns to emerge. Professionalstrade only when markets offer them special advantages.\nAccording to chaos theory, many processes—the flow of water in a\nriver, the movement of clouds in the sky, the changes of prices in thecotton markets—are chaotic, with transient islands of order, called frac-tals. Those fractals look similar from any distance, whether through atelescope or a microscope. The coast of Maine looks just as jaggedfrom a space shuttle as it does when you drop down on your handsand knees and look at it through a magnifying glass. In most finan-cial markets, the long-term weekly charts and the short-term 5-minutecharts look so similar, you cannot tell them apart without markings.Engineers have realized that they can achieve better control over manyprocesses if they accept them as chaotic and try to capitalize on tem-porary fractals, the islands of order. That’s exactly what a good traderdoes. He recognizes the market as chaotic and unpredictable much ofthe time, but expects to find islands of order. He trains himself to buyand sell without quibbling when he finds those patterns.\nSuccessful trading depends on the 3 M’s—Mind, Method, and Money.\nBeginners focus on analysis, but professionals operate in a three-dimensional space. They are aware of trading psychology—their ownfeelings and the mass psychology of the markets. Each trader needs tohave a method for choosing specific stocks, options, or futures as wellas firm rules for pulling the trigger—deciding when to buy and sell.Money refers to how you manage your trading capital.\nMind, Method, Money—trading psychology, trading method, and\nmoney management—people sometimes ask me which of the threeis more important. It is like asking which leg of a three-legged stool isthe most important. Take them away one at a time and then try to sitdown. In Part 2 we focus on those three foundations of market success.46 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nCHAPTER\nFOUR\nMIND—\nTHE DISCIPLINED TRADER*\nTraders come to the markets with great expectations, but few make\nprofits and most wash out. The industry hides good statistics from\nthe public, while promoting its Big Lie that money lost by losers goesto winners. In fact, winners collect only a fraction of the money lost bylosers. The bulk of losses goes to the trading industry as the cost ofdoing business—commissions, slippage, and expenses—by both win-ners and losers. A successful trader must hop over several high hur-dles—and keep hopping. Being better than average is not goodenough—you have to be head and shoulders above the crowd. Youcan win only if you have both knowledge and discipline.\nMost amateurs come to the markets with half-baked trading plans,\nclueless about psychology or money management. Most get hurt andquit after a few painful hits. Others find more cash and return to trad-ing. We do not have to call people who keep dropping money in themarkets losers because they do get something in return. What they getis fantastic entertainment value.\nMarkets are the most entertaining places on the face of the Earth.\nThey are like a card game, a chess game, and a horse race all rolledinto one. The game goes on at all hours—you can always find action.\nAn acquaintance of mine had a terrible home life. He avoided his\nwife by staying late in the office, but the building closed on weekends,pushing him into the bosom of his family. By Sunday mornings hecould take no more “family togetherness” and escaped to the basementof his house. There he had set up a trading apparatus, using the equip-ment loaned to him by another loser in exchange for a share of future\n47*Thanks to Mark Douglas, the title of whose book I borrowed to name this chapter.\nprofits. What can you trade on a Sunday morning in suburban Boston?\nIt turned out that the gold markets were open in the Middle East. Myacquaintance used to turn on his quote screen, get on the phone (thiswas in the pre-Internet days), and trade gold in Abu Dhabi!\nHe never asked himself what his edge was over local traders. What\nhas he got, sitting in a bucolic suburb of Boston, that they haven’t gotin Abu Dhabi? Why should locals send him money? Every professionalknows his edge, but ask an amateur and he’ll draw a blank. A personwho doesn’t know his edge does not have it and will lose money.Warren Buffett, one of the richest investors on Earth, says that whenyou sit down to a game of poker, you must know within 15 minutes whois going to supply the winnings, and if you don’t know the answer, thatperson is you. My Boston buddy wound up losing his house in a bank-ruptcy, which put a whole new spin on his marital problems, eventhough he no longer traded gold in Abu Dhabi.\nMany people, whether rich or poor, feel trapped and bored. As\nHenry David Thoreau wrote almost two centuries ago, “The mass ofmen lead lives of quiet desperation.”\nWe wake up in the same bed each morning, eat the same breakfast,\nand drive to work down the same road. We see the same dull faces inthe office and shuffle papers on our old desks. We drive home, watchthe same dumb shows on TV, have a beer, and go to sleep in the samebed. We repeat this routine day after day, month after month, year afteryear. It feels like a life sentence without parole. What is there to lookforward to? Perhaps a brief vacation next year? We’ll buy a packagedeal, fly to Paris, get on a bus with the rest of the group, and spend15 minutes in front of the Triumphal Arch and half an hour going upthe Eiffel Tower. Then back home, back to the old routine.\nMost people live in a deep invisible groove—no need to think,\nmake decisions, feel the raw edge of life. The routine does feel com-fortable—but deathly boring.\nEven amusements stop being fun. How many Hollywood movies\ncan you watch on a weekend until they all become a blur? How many tripsto Disneyland can you take before all the rides in plastic soap dishesfeel like one endless ride to nowhere? To quote Thoreau again, “Astereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what arecalled games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them.”\nAnd then you open a trading account and punch in an order to buy\n500 shares of Intel. Anyone with a few thousand dollars can escape theroutine and find excitement in the markets.48 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nSuddenly, the world is in living color! Intel ticks up half a point—\nyou check quotes, run out for a newspaper, and tune in for the latestupdates. If you have a computer at work, you set up a little quote win-dow to keep an eye on your stock. Before the Internet, people usedto buy pocket FM receivers for market quotes and hide them in half-open desk drawers. Their antennae, sticking out of desks of middle-aged men, looked like beams of light shining into prison cells.\nIntel is up a point! Should you sell and take profits? Buy more and\ndouble up? Your heart is pounding—you feel alive! Now it’s up threepoints. You multiply that by the number of shares you have and realizethat your profits after just a few hours are close to your weekly salary.You start calculating percentage returns—if you continue trading likethat for the rest of the year, what a fortune you’ll have by Christmas!\nSuddenly you raise your eyes from the calculator to see that Intel has\ndropped two points. Your stomach is tied in a knot, your face pushesinto the screen, you hunch over, compressing your lungs, reducing theflow of blood to the brain, which is a terrible position for making deci-sions. You are flooded with anxiety, like a trapped animal. You arehurting—but you are alive!\nTrading is the most exciting activity that a person can do with\ntheir clothes on. Trouble is, you cannot feel excited and make money\nat the same time. Think of a casino, where amateurs celebrate over freedrinks, while professional card-counters coldly play game after game,folding most of the time, and pressing their advantage when the cardcount gives them a slight edge over the house. To be a successful trader,you have to develop iron discipline (Mind), acquire an edge over themarkets (Method), and control risks in your trading account (Money).\nSLEEPWALKING THROUGH THE MARKETS\nThere is only one rational reason to trade—to make money. Moneyattracts us to the markets, but in the excitement of the new game weoften lose sight of that goal. We start trading for entertainment, as anescape, to show off in front of our family and friends, and so on. Oncea trader loses his focus on money, his goose is cooked.\nIt is easy to feel cool, calm, and collected reading a book or look-\ning at your charts on a weekend. It’s easy to be rational when the mar-kets are closed—but what happens after 30 minutes in front of a livescreen? Does your pulse begin to race? Do upticks and downtickshypnotize you? Traders get an adrenaline rush from the market, andMIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 49\nthe excitement clouds their judgment. Calm resolutions made on a\nweekend fly out the window during rallies or declines. “This time isdifferent . . . It’s an exception . . . I won’t put in a stop now, the mar-ket is too volatile” are the giveaway phrases of emotional traders.\nMany intelligent people sleepwalk through the markets. Their eyes\nare open, but their minds are shut. They are driven by emotions andkeep repeating their mistakes. It is OK to make mistakes but not OKto repeat them. When you make a mistake for the first time, it showsthat you are alive, searching, experimenting. Repeating a mistake is aneurotic symptom.\nLosers come in all genders, ages, and colors, but several stock\nphrases give them away. Let us review some of the common excuses.If you recognize yourself, use that as a sign to start learning a new ap-proach to the markets.\nBlame the Broker\nA trader hears his broker’s voice at the most important and tensemoments—when placing buy or sell orders or requesting informationthat may lead to an order. The broker is close to the market, and manyof us assume that he knows more than we do. We try to read ourbroker’s voice and figure out whether he approves or disapproves ofour actions.\nIs listening to your broker’s voice a part of your trading system? Does\nit say to buy when the weekly moving average is up, daily Force Indexis down, and the broker sounds enthused? Or does it simply say to buywhen such and such indicators reach such and such parameters?\nTrying to read your broker’s voice is a sign of insecurity, a common\nstate for beginners. Markets are huge and volatile, and their rallies anddeclines can feel overpowering. Frightened people look for someonestrong and wise to lead them out of the wilderness. Can your brokerlead you? Probably not, but if you lose money, you’ll have a greatexcuse—it was your broker who put you into that stupid trade.\nA lawyer who was shopping for an expert witness recently called\nme. His client, a university professor, had shorted Dell at 20 severalyears ago, before the splits, after his broker told him it “could not goany higher.” That stock became the darling of the bull market, wentthrough the roof, and a year later the professor covered at 80, wipingout his million-dollar account, which represented his life savings. That50 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nman was smart enough to earn a Ph.D. and save a million dollars but\nemotional enough to follow his broker while his life savings weredoing a slow burn. Few people sue their brokers, but almost all begin-ners blame them.\nTraders’ feelings towards brokers are similar to patients’ feelings\ntowards psychoanalysts. A patient lies on the couch, and the analyst’svoice, emerging at important moments, seems to carry deeper psycho-logical truths than the patient could have possibly discovered him-self. In reality, a good broker is a craftsman who can sometimes helpyou get better fills and dig up information you requested. He is yourhelper—not your advisor. Looking to a broker for guidance is a sign ofinsecurity, which is not conducive to trading success.\nMost people start trading more actively after switching to electronic\nbrokers. Low commissions are a factor, but the psychological changeis more important. People are less self-conscious when they don’t haveto deal with a live person. All of us occasionally make stupid trades,and electronic brokers allow us to make them in private. We are lessashamed hitting a key than calling a broker.\nSome traders manage to transfer their anxieties and fears onto elec-\ntronic brokers. They complain that electronic brokers do not do whatthey want, such as accept certain types of orders. Why don’t you trans-fer your account, I ask—and see fear in their faces. It is the fear ofchange, of upsetting the cart.\nTo be a successful trader, you must accept total responsibility for\nyour decisions and actions.\nBlame the Guru\nA beginner entering the markets soon finds himself surrounded by a col-orful crowd of gurus—experts who sell trading advice. Most charge fees,but some give advice for free to drum up business for their brokeragefirms. Gurus publish newsletters, are quoted in the media, and manywould kill to get on TV. Masses are hungry for clarity, and gurus arethere to feed that hunger. Most are failed traders, but being a guru is notthat easy. Their mortality rate is high, and few stay around for more thantwo years. The novelty wears off, customers do not renew subscriptions,and a guru finds it easier to earn a living selling aluminum siding thandrawing trendlines. My chapter on the guru business in Trading for a\nLiving drew more howls and threats than any other in that book.MIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 51\nTraders go through three stages in their attitudes towards gurus. In\nthe beginning, they drink in their advice, expecting to make moneyfrom it. At the second stage, traders start avoiding gurus like theplague, viewing them as distractions from their own decision-makingprocess. Finally, some successful traders start paying attention to a fewgurus who alert them to new opportunities.\nSome losing traders go looking for a trainer, a teacher, or a therapist.\nVery few people are experts in both psychology and trading. I’ve metseveral gurus who couldn’t trade their way out of a paper bag butclaimed that their alleged expertise in psychology qualified them totrain traders. Stop for a moment and compare this to sex therapy. If Ihad a sexual problem, I might see a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a sextherapist, or even a pastoral counselor, but I would never go to aCatholic priest, even if I were Catholic. That priest has no practicalknowledge of the problem—and if he does, you want to run, not walkaway. A teacher who does not trade is highly suspect.\nTraders go through several stages in their attitudes towards tips.\nBeginners love them, those who are more serious insist on doing theirown homework, while advanced traders may listen to tips but alwaysdrop them into their own trading systems to see whether that advicewill hold up. Whenever I hear a trading tip, I run it through my owncomputerized screens. The decision to buy, go short, or stand aside ismine alone, with an average yield of one tip accepted out of every 20heard. Tips draw my attention to opportunities I might have over-looked, but there are no shortcuts to sweating your own trades.\nA greenhorn who has gotten burned may ask for a guru’s track\nrecord. Years ago I used to publish a newsletter and noticed how fright-eningly easy it was for gurus to massage and slant their records, evenif they were tracked by independent rating services.\nI’ve never met a trader who took all the recommendations of his\nguru, even if he paid him a lot of money. If a guru has 200 subscribers,they’ll choose different recommendations, trade them differently, andmost will lose money, each in his own way. There is a rule in the advi-sory business: “If you make forecasts for a living, make a lot of them.”Gurus offer convenient excuses to sleepwalking traders who need ascapegoat for their losses.\nWhether or not you listen to a guru, you’re 100% responsible for the\noutcome of your trades. The next time you get a hot tip, drop it intoyour trading system to see whether it gives you a buy or sell signal.You are responsible for the consequences of taking or rejecting advice.52 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nBlame the Unexpected News\nIt is easy to feel angry and hurt when a sudden piece of bad news\nblows a hole in your stock. You buy something, it goes up, bad newshits the market, and your stock collapses. The market did it to you, yousay? The news may have been sudden, but you are responsible forhandling any challenges.\nMost company news is released on a regular schedule. If you trade\na certain stock, you should know well in advance when that companyreleases its earnings and be prepared for any market reaction to thenews. Lighten up on your position if unsure about the impact of a com-ing announcement. If you trade bonds, currencies, or stock indexfutures, you must know when the key economic statistics are releasedand how the leading indicators or the unemployment rate can impactyour market. It may be wise to tighten your stops or reduce the size ofyour trade in advance of an important news release.\nWhat about a truly unexpected piece of news—a president gets shot,\na noted analyst comes out with a bearish earnings forecast, and so on?You must research your market and know what happened after simi-lar events in the past; you have to do your homework before the eventhits you. Having this knowledge allows you to act without delay. Forexample, the stock market’s reaction to an assault on a president hasalways been a sharp hiccup to the downside, followed by a completeretracement, so a sensible thing to do is buy the break.\nYour trading plan must include the possibility of a sharp adverse\nmove caused by sudden events. You must have your stop in place, andthe size of your trade must be such that you cannot get financially hurtin the case of a reversal. There are many risks waiting to spring on atrader—you alone are responsible for damage control.\nWishful Thinking\nWhen the pain grows bit by bit, the natural tendency is to do nothingand wait for an improvement. A sleepwalking trader gives his losingtrades “more time to work out,” while they slowly destroy his account.\nA sleepwalker hopes and dreams. He sits on a loss and says, “This\nstock is coming back; it always did.” Winners accept occasional losses,take them, and move on. Losers postpone taking losses. An amateurputs on a trade the way a kid buys a lottery ticket. He waits for thewheel of fortune to decide whether he wins or loses. Professionals, toMIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 53\nthe contrary, have ironclad plans for getting out, either with a profit\nor a small loss. One of the key differences between professionals andamateurs is their planning for exits.\nA sleepwalking trader buys at 35 and puts in a stop at 32. The stock\nsinks to 33, and he says, “I’ll give it a little more room.” He moves hisstop down to 30. That is a fatal mistake—he has breached his disci-pline and violated his own plan.\nYou may move stops only one way—in the direction of your trade.\nStops are like a ratchet on a sailboat, designed to take the slack out ofyour sails. If you start giving your trade “more room to breathe,” that extraslack will swing around and hurt you. When the market rewards tradersfor breaking their rules, it sets up an even deeper trap in their next trade.\nThe best time to make decisions is before you enter a trade. Your\nmoney is not at risk, and you can weigh profit targets and loss param-eters. Once you’re in a trade, you begin to form an attachment to it.The market hypnotizes you and lures you into emotional decisions.This is why you must write down your exit plan and follow it.\nTurning a losing trade into an “investment” is a common disease\namong small private traders, but some institutional traders also sufferfrom it. Disasters at banks and major financial firms occur when poorlysupervised traders lose money in short-term trades and stick them intolong-term accounts, hoping that time will bail them out. If you are los-ing in the beginning, you’ll lose in the end. Do not put off the hour ofreckoning. The first loss is the best loss—this is the rule of those of uswho trade with our eyes open.\nA R EMEDY FOR SELF-DESTRUCTIVENESS\nPeople who like to complain about their bad luck are often experts inlooking for trouble and snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Afriend in the construction business used to have a driver who dreamedof buying his own truck and working for himself. He saved money foryears and finally paid cash for a huge brand-new truck. He quit his job,got gloriously drunk, and at the end of the day rolled his uninsuredtruck down an embankment—it was totaled, and the driver came backasking for his old job. Tragedy? Drama? Or fear of freedom and anunconscious wish for a safe job with a steady paycheck?\nWhy do intelligent people with a track record of success keep losing\nmoney on one harebrained trade after another, stumbling from calamityto catastrophe? Ignorance? Bad luck? Or a hidden desire to fail?54 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nMany people have a self-destructive streak. My experience as a psy-\nchiatrist has convinced me that most people who complain aboutsevere problems are in fact sabotaging themselves. I cannot change apatient’s external reality, but whenever I cure one of self-sabotage, hequickly resolves his external problems.\nSelf-destructiveness is such a pervasive human trait because civiliza-\ntion is built on controlling aggression. As we grow up, we are trainedto control aggression against others—behave, do not push, be nice.Our aggression has to go somewhere, and many turn it against them-selves, the only unprotected target. We turn our anger inward and learnto sabotage ourselves. Little wonder so many of us grow up fearful,inhibited, and shy.\nSociety has several defenses against the extremes of self-sabotage.\nThe police will talk a potential suicide down from the roof, and themedical board will take the scalpel away from an accident-prone sur-geon, but no one will stop a self-defeating trader. He can run amok inthe financial markets, inflicting wounds on himself, while brokers andother traders gladly take his money. Financial markets lack protectivecontrols against self-sabotage.\nAre you sabotaging yourself? The only way to find out is to keep\ngood records, especially a Trader’s Journal and an equity curve, shownlater in this book. The angle of your equity curve is an objective indi-cator of your behavior. If it slopes up, with few downticks, you’redoing well. If it points down, it shows you’re not in gear with the mar-kets and possibly in a self-sabotage mode. When you observe that,reduce the size of your trades and spend more time with your Trader’sJournal figuring out what you’re doing.\nYou need to become a self-aware trader. Keep good records, learn\nfrom past mistakes, and do better in the future. Traders who losemoney tend to feel ashamed. A bad loss feels like a nasty comment—most people just want to cover up, walk away, and never be seenagain. Hiding doesn’t solve anything. Use the pain of a loss to turnyourself into a disciplined winner.\nLosers Anonymous\nYears ago I had an insight that changed my trading life forever. Backin those days my equity used to swing up and down like a yo-yo. Iknew enough about markets to profit from many trades but couldn’thold on to my gains and grow equity. The insight that eventually gotMIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 55\nme off the roller coaster came from a chance visit to a meeting of\nAlcoholics Anonymous.\nOne late afternoon I accompanied a friend to an AA meeting at a\nlocal YMCA. Suddenly, the meeting gripped me. I felt as if the peoplein the room were talking about my trading! All I had to do was substi-tute the word lossfor the word alcohol .\nPeople at the AA meeting talked about how alcohol controlled their\nlives, and my trading in those days was driven by losses—fearing themand trying to trade my way out. My emotions followed a jagged equitycurve—elation at the highs and cold clammy fear at the lows, with fin-gers trembling above the speed dial button.\nBack in those days I had a busy psychiatric practice and saw my\nshare of alcoholics. I began to notice similarities between them and los-ing traders. Losers approached markets the way alcoholics walked intobars. They entered with pleasant expectations, but left with meanheadaches, hangovers, and loss of control. Drinking and trading lurepeople across the line from pleasure to self-destructiveness.\nAlcoholics and losers live with their eyes closed—both are in the\ngrip of an addiction. Every alcoholic I saw in my office wanted to argueabout his diagnosis. To avoid wasting time, I used to suggest a simpletest. I’d tell alcoholics to keep on drinking as usual for the next week,but write down every drink, and bring that record to our next appoint-ment. Not a single alcoholic could keep that diary for more than a fewdays because looking in a mirror reduced the pleasure of impulsivebehavior. Today when I tell losing traders to keep a diary of theirtrades, many become annoyed.\nGood records are a sign of self-awareness and discipline. Poor or\nabsent records are a sign of impulsive trading. Show me a trader withgood records, and I’ll show you a good trader.\nAlcoholics and losers do not think about the past or the future, and\nfocus only on the present—the sensation of alcohol pouring downthe gullet or the market pulsing on the screen. An active alcoholic isin denial; he doesn’t want to know about the depth of his abyss, theseverity of his problem, or the harm he is causing himself and others.\nThe only thing that can pierce an alcoholic’s denial is the pain of hit-\nting what AA calls “rock bottom.” It is each individual’s private versionof hell—a life-threatening illness, a rejection by family, a job loss, oranother catastrophic event. The unbearable pain of hitting rock bottompunctures the alcoholic’s denial and forces him to face a stark choice:he can self-destruct or turn his life around.56 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAA is a nonprofit voluntary organization whose only purpose is to\nhelp alcoholics stay sober. It doesn’t ask for donations, advertise,lobby, or take part in any public actions. It has no paid therapists;members help each other at meetings led by long-term members. AAhas a system of sponsorships whereby older members sponsor andsupport newer ones.\nAn alcoholic who joins AA goes through what is called a 12-Step\nprogram. Each step is a stage of personal growth and recovery. Themethod is so effective that people recovering from other addictivebehaviors have begun to use it. \nThe first step is the most important for traders. It looks easy, but is\nextremely hard to take. Many alcoholics can’t take it, drop out of AA,and go on to destroy their lives. The first step consists of standing upat a meeting, facing a room full of recovering alcoholics, and admittingthat alcohol is stronger than you. This is hard because if alcohol isstronger than you, you cannot touch it again. Once you take the firststep, you are committed to a struggle for sobriety.\nAlcohol is such a powerful drug that AA recommends planning to\nlive without it one day at a time. A recovering alcoholic does not planto be sober a year or five years from now. He has a simpler goal—goto bed sober tonight. Eventually those days of sobriety add up to years.The entire system of AA meetings and sponsorships is geared towardthe goal of sobriety one day at a time.\nAA aims to change not only the behavior but the personality in order\nto reinforce sobriety. AA members call some people “sober drunks.” Itsounds like a contradiction in terms. If a person is sober, how can hebe a drunk? Sobriety alone is not enough. A person who has notchanged his thinking is just one step away from sliding back into drink-ing under stress or out of boredom. An alcoholic has to change his wayof being and feeling to recover from alcoholism.\nI never had a problem with alcohol, but my psychiatric experience\nhad taught me to respect AA for its success with alcoholics. It was nota popular view. Each patient who went to AA reduced the profession’sincome, but that never bothered me. After my first AA meeting I real-ized that if millions of alcoholics could recover by following the pro-gram, then traders could stop losing, regain balance, and becomewinners by applying the principles of AA.\nHow can we translate the lessons of AA into the language of trading?A losing trader is in denial. His equity is shrinking, but he continues\nto jump into trades without analyzing what is going wrong. He keepsMIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 57\nswitching between markets the way an alcoholic switches between\nwhiskey and cheap wine. An amateur whose mind isn’t strong enoughto accept a small loss will eventually take the mother of all losses. Agaping hole in a trading account hurts self-esteem. A single huge lossor a series of bad losses smash a trader against his rock bottom. Mostbeginners collapse and wash out. The lifetime of an average specula-tor is measured in months, not years.\nThose who survive fall into two groups. Some return to their old ways,\njust like alcoholics crawl into a bar after surviving a bout of delirium.They toss more money into their accounts and become customers ofvendors who sell magical trading systems. They continue to gamble,only now their hands shake from anxiety and fear when they try to pullthe trigger.\nA minority of traders that hit rock bottom decide to change. Recovery\nis a slow and solitary process. Charles Mackay, the author of one of thebest books on crowd psychology, wrote almost two centuries ago thatmen go mad in crowds, but come to their senses slowly, and one by one.I wish we had an organization for recovering traders, the way recover-ing alcoholics have AA. We don’t because trading is so competitive.Members of AA strive for sobriety together, but a meeting of recoveringtraders could easily be poisoned by envy and showing off. Markets aresuch cutthroat places that we don’t form mutual support groups orfind sponsors. Some opportunists hold themselves out as traders’ coaches,but most make me shudder at their sharkiness. If we had a traders’ or-ganization, I’d call it Losers Anonymous (LA). The name is blunt, but\nthat’s fine. After all, Alcoholics Anonymous does not call itself Dr inkers\nAnonymous. A harsh name helps traders face their impulsivity and self-sabotage. Since we do not have LA, you’ll have to walk on the road torecovery alone. I wrote this book to help you along the way.\nBusinessman’s Risk vs. Loss\nYears ago, when I began my recovery from losing, each morning I heldwhat I called a Losers Anonymous meeting for one. I’d come into theoffice, turn on my quote screen, and while it was warming up I’d say,“Good morning, my name is Alex, and I am a loser. I have it in me todo serious damage to my account. I’ve done it before. My only goal fortoday is to go home without a loss.” When the screen was up, I’d begintrading, following the plan written down the night before while themarkets were closed.58 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nI can immediately hear an objection—what do you mean, go home\nwithout a loss? It is impossible to make money every day. What hap-pens if you buy something, and it goes straight down—in other words,you’ve bought the top tick of the day? What if you sell something shortand it immediately rallies?\nWe must draw a clear line between a loss and a businessman’s risk.\nA businessman’s risk is a small dip in equity. A loss goes through thatlimit. As a trader, I am in the business of trading and must take normalbusiness risks, but I cannot afford losses.\nImagine you’re not trading but running a fruit and vegetable stand.\nYou take a risk each time you buy a crate of tomatoes. If your cus-tomers do not buy them, that crate will rot on you. That’s a normalbusiness risk—you expect to sell most of your inventory, but some fruitand vegetables will spoil. As long as you buy carefully, keeping theunsold spoiled fruit to a small percentage of your daily volume, yourbusiness stays profitable.\nImagine that a wholesaler brings a tractor-trailer full of exotic fruit to\nyour stand and tries to sell you the entire load. He says that you canearn more in the next two days than you made in the previous sixmonths. It sounds great—but what if your customers don’t buy thatexotic fruit? A rotting tractor-trailer load can hurt your business andendanger its survival. It’s no longer a businessman’s risk—it’s a loss.\nMoney management rules draw a straight line between a business-\nman’s risk and a loss, as you will see later in this book.\nSome traders have argued that my AA approach is too negative. A\nyoung woman in Singapore told me she believed in positive thinkingand thought of herself as a winner. She could afford to be positivebecause discipline was imposed on her from the outside, by the man-ager of the bank for which she traded. Another winner who arguedwith me was a lady from Texas in her seventies, a wildly successfultrader of stock index futures. She was very religious and viewed her-self as a steward of money. Each morning she got up early and prayedlong and hard. Then she drove to the office and traded the living day-lights out of the S&P. The minute a trade went against her, she’d cutand run—because the money belonged to the Lord and wasn’t hers tolose. She kept her losses small and accumulated profits.\nI thought that our approaches had a lot in common. Both of us\nhad principles outside the market preventing us from losing money.Markets are the most permissive places in the world. You may do any-MIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 59\nthing you like, as long as you have enough equity to put on a trade.\nIt’s easy to get caught in the excitement, which is why you need rules.I rely on the principles of AA, another trader relies on her religiousfeelings, and you may choose something else. Just make sure you havea set of principles that clearly tells you what you may or may not doin the markets.\nSober in Battle\nMost traders open accounts with money earned in business or the pro-fessions. Many bring a personal track record of success and expect todo well in the markets. If we can run a hotel, perform eye surgery, ortry cases in court, we can surely find our way between the high, thelow, and the close! But the markets, which seem so simple at first, keephumbling us.\nLittle blood gets spilled in trading, but the money, the lifeblood of\nthe markets, has a major impact on the quality and the length of ourlives. Recently, a friend who writes a stock market advisory showedme a stack of letters from his subscribers. The one that caught myeye came from a man who made enough money trading to pay for akidney transplant. It saved his life, but I thought of what happenedto legions of others who also had big needs but traded poorly andlost m oney.\nTrading is a battle. When you pick up your weapon and put your\nlife on the line, would you rather be drunk or sober? You have to pre-pare yourself, choose your fight, go in when you are ready, and quitafter you’ve done what you’ve planned. A man who is cool and sobercalmly picks his fights. He enters and leaves when he chooses and notwhen some bully throws him a challenge. A disciplined player chooseshis own game out of hundreds available. He doesn’t have to chaseevery rabbit like a dog with its tongue hanging out—he lays an ambushfor his game and lets it come to him.\nMost amateurs won’t admit they are trading for entertainment. A\ncommon cover story is that they’re in the markets to make money. Inreality, most traders get tremendous thrills tossing money at half-bakedideas. Trading financial markets is more respectable than betting onponies, but the kicks are just as good.\nI tell my horse-playing friends to imagine going to a race where you\ncan place bets after the horses are out of the gate and take your money60 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\noff the table before the race ends. Trading is a fantastic game, but its\ntemptations are very intense.\nTHEMATURE TRADER\nSuccessful traders are sharp, curious, and unassuming people. Mosthave been through losing periods. They graduated from the school ofhard knocks, and that experience helped smooth their rough edges.\nSuccessful traders are self-assured but never arrogant. People who sur-\nvive in the markets remain alert. They trust their skills and trading meth-ods, but keep their eyes and ears open for new developments. Confidentand attentive, calm and flexible, successful traders are fun to be with.\nSuccessful traders are often unconventional people, and some are\nvery eccentric. When they mix with others, they often break social rules.\nThe markets are set up for the majority to lose money, and a small group\nof winners marches to a different drummer, in and out of the markets.\nMarkets consist of huge crowds of people watching the same trad-\ning vehicles, mesmerized by upticks and downticks. Think of a crowdat a concert or in a movie theater. When the show begins, the crowdgets emotionally in gear and develops an amorphous but powerfulmass mind, laughing or weeping together. A mass mind also emergesin the markets, only here it is more malignant. Instead of laughing orweeping, the crowd seeks each trader’s private psychological weak-ness and hits him in that spot.\nMarkets seduce greedy traders into buying positions that are too\nlarge for their accounts and then destroy them with a reaction they can-not afford to sit out. They shake fearful traders out of winning tradeswith brief countertrend spikes before embarking on runaway moves.Lazy traders are the favorite victims of the market, which keeps throw-ing new tricks at the unprepared. Whatever your psychological flawsand fears, whatever your inner demons, whatever your hidden weak-nesses and obsessions, the market will seek them out, find them, anduse them against you, like a skilled wrestler uses his opponent’s ownweight to toss him to the ground.\nSuccessful traders have outgrown or overcome their inner demons.\nInstead of being tossed by the markets, they maintain their own bal-ance and scan for chinks in the crowd’s armor, so that they can tossthe market for a change. They may appear eccentric, but when itcomes to trading they are much healthier than the crowd.MIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 61\nBeing a trader is a journey of self-discovery. Trade long enough, and\nyou will face all your psychological handicaps—anxiety, greed, fear,anger, and sloth. Remember, you’re not in the markets for psychother-apy; self-discovery is a byproduct, not the goal of trading. The primarygoal of a successful trader is to accumulate equity. Healthy tradingboils down to two questions you need to ask in every trade: “What ismy profit target?” and “How will I protect my capital?”\nA good trader accepts full responsibility for the outcome of every\ntrade. You cannot blame others for taking your money. You have toimprove your trading plans and methods of money management. It willtake time, and it will take discipline.\nDiscipline\nA friend of mine used to have a dog-training business. Occasionally aprospective client would call her and say, “I want to train my dog tocome when called, but I do not want to train it to sit or lie down.” Andshe’d answer, “Training a dog to come off-leash is one of the hardestthings to teach; you must do a lot of obedience training first. Whatyou’re saying sounds like, ‘I want my dog be a neurosurgeon, but I donot want it to go to high school.’”\nMany new traders expect to sit in front of their screens and make\neasy money day-trading. They skip high school and head straight forneurosurgery.\nDiscipline is necessary for success in most endeavors, but especially\nin the markets because they have no external controls. You have towatch yourself because no one else will, except for the margin clerk.You may put on the stupidest and self-destructive trades, but as long asyou have enough money in your account, no one will stop you. No onewill say hold on, wait, think what you’re doing! Your broker will repeatyour order to confirm he got it right. Once your order hits the market,other traders will scramble for the privilege of taking your money.\nMost fields of human endeavor have rules, yardsticks, and profes-\nsional bodies to enforce discipline. No matter how independent youfeel, there is always some agency looking over your shoulder. If a doc-tor in private practice starts writing too many prescriptions for pain-killers, he’ll soon hear from the health department. Markets impose norestrictions, as long as you have enough equity. Adding to losing posi-tions is similar to overprescribing narcotics, but nobody will stop you.As a matter of fact, other market participants want you to be undisci-62 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nplined and impulsive. That makes it easier for them to get your money.\nYour defense against self-destructiveness is discipline. You have to setup your own rules and follow them in order to prevent self-sabotage.\nDiscipline means designing, testing, and following your trading sys-\ntem. It means learning to enter and exit in response to predefined sig-nals rather than jumping in and out on a whim. It means doing theright thing, not the easy thing. And the first challenge on the road todisciplined trading involves setting up a record-keeping system.\nRecord-Keeping\nGood traders keep good records. They keep them not just for theiraccountants but as tools of learning and discipline. If you do not havegood records, how can you measure your performance, rate yourprogress, and learn from your mistakes? Those who do not learn fromthe past are doomed to repeat it.\nWhen you decide to become a trader, you sign up for an expensive\ncourse. By the time you figure out the game, its cost may equal that ofa college education, only most students never graduate—they drop outand get nothing for their money except for memories of a few wild rides.\nWhenever you decide to improve your performance in any area of\nlife, record keeping helps. If you want to become a better runner, keep-ing records of your speeds is essential for designing better workouts.If money is a problem, keeping and reviewing records of all ex-penditures is certain to uncover wasteful tendencies. Keeping scrupu-lous records turns a spotlight on a problem and allows you to improve.\nBecoming a good trader means taking several courses—psychology,\ntechnical analysis, and money management. Each course requires itsown set of records. You’ll have to score high on all three in order tograduate.\nYour first essential record is a spreadsheet of all your trades. You have\nto keep track of entries and exits, slippage and commissions, as wellas profits and losses. Chapter 5, “Method—Technical Analysis” on trad-ing channels will teach you to rate the quality of every trade, allowingyou to compare performance across different markets and conditions.\nAnother essential record shows the balance in your account at the\nend of each month. Plot it on a chart, creating an equity curve whoseangle will tell you whether you are in gear with the market. The goalis a steady uptrend, punctuated by shallow declines. If your curveslopes down, it shows you’re not in tune with the markets and mustMIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 63\nreduce the size of your trades. A jagged equity curve tends to be a sign\nof impulsive trading.\nYour trading diary is the third essential record. Whenever you enter\na trade, print out the charts that prompted you to buy or sell. Pastethem on the left page of a large notebook and write a few wordsexplaining why you bought or sold, stating your profit objective and astop. When you close out that trade, print out the charts again, pastethem on the right page and write what you’ve learned from the com-pleted trade.\nThese records are essential for all traders, and we will return to them\nlater in Chapter 8, “The Organized Trader.” A shoebox crammed withconfirmation slips does not qualify as a record-keeping system. Toomany records? Not enough time? Want to skip high school and diveinto neurosurgery? Traders fail because of impatience and lack of dis-cipline. Good records set you apart from the market crowd and putyou on the road to success.\nTraining for Battle\nHow much training you need depends on the job you want. If youwant to be a janitor, an hour of training might do. Just learn to attacha mop to the right end of the broomstick and find a pail without holes.If, on the other hand, you want to fly an airplane or do surgery, you’llhave to learn a great deal more. Trading is closer to flying a plane thanto mopping a floor, meaning you’ll need to invest a lot of time andenergy in mastering this craft.\nSociety mandates extensive training for pilots and doctors because\ntheir errors are so deadly. As a trader, you are free to be financiallydeadly to yourself—society does not care, because your loss is some-one else’s gain. Flying and medicine have standards and yardsticks, aswell as professional bodies to enforce them. In trading, you have to setup your own rules and be your own enforcer.\nPilots and doctors learn from instructors who impose discipline on\nthem through tests and evaluations. Private traders have no externalsystem for learning, testing, or discipline. Our job is hard because wemust learn on our own, develop discipline, and test ourselves againand again in the markets.\nWhen we look at training for pilots and doctors, three features stand\nout. They are the gradual assumption of responsibility, constant evalu-64 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nations, and training until actions become automatic. Let us see whether\nwe can apply them to trading.\n1. The Gradual Assumption of Responsibility A flying school doesn’t\nput a beginner into a pilot’s seat on his first day. A medical student islucky if he is allowed to take a patient’s temperature on his first day inthe hospital. His superiors double-check him before he can advance tothe next, slightly higher level of responsibility.\nHow does this compare to the education of a new trader? There is nothing gradual about it. Most people start out on an im-\npulse, after hearing a hot tip or a rumor of someone making money. Abeginner has some cash burning a hole in his pocket. He gets a bro-ker’s name out of a newspaper, FedExes him a check, and enters hisfirst trade. Now he is starting to learn! When do they close this market?What is a gap opening? How come the market is up and my stock isdown?\nA “sink or swim” approach does not work in complex enterprises,\nsuch as flying or trading. It is exciting to jump in, but excitement isnot what good traders are after. If you do not have a specific trading plan,you’re better off taking your money to Vegas. The outcome will be thesame, but at least there they’ll throw in some free drinks.\nIf you are serious about learning to trade, start with a relatively small\naccount and set a goal of learning to trade rather than making a lot ofmoney in a hurry. Keep a trading diary and put a performance gradeon every trade.\n2. Constant Evaluations and Ratings The progress of a flying cadet\nor a medical student is measured by hundreds of tests. Teachers con-stantly rate knowledge, skills, and decision-making ability. A studentwith good results is given more responsibility, but if his performanceslips, he has to study more and take more tests.\nDo traders go through a similar process?As long as you have money in your account, you can make impul-\nsive trades, trying to weasel your way out of a hole. You can throwconfirmation slips into a shoebox, and give them to your accountant attax time. No one can force you to look at your test results, unless youdo it yourself.\nThe market tests us all the time, but only a few pay attention. It gives\na performance grade to every trade and posts those ratings, but fewMIND—THE DISCIPLINED TRADER 65\npeople know where to look them up. Another highly objective test is\nour equity curve. If you trade several markets, you can take this test inevery one of them, as well as in your account as a whole. Do most ofus take this test? No. Pilots and doctors must answer to their licensingbodies, but traders sneak out of class because no one takes attendanceand their internal discipline is weak. Meanwhile, tests are a key part oftrading discipline, essential for your victory in the markets. Keepingand reviewing records, as outlined later in this book, puts you a mileahead of undisciplined competitors.\n3. Training until Actions Become Automatic During one of my\nfinals in medical school I was sent to examine a patient in a half-emptyroom. Suddenly I heard a noise from behind the curtain. I looked, andthere was another patient—dying. “No pulse,” I yelled to another stu-dent, and together we put the man on the floor. I began pumping hischest, while the other fellow gave him mouth to mouth, one forcedbreath for four chest pumps. Neither of us could run for help, butsomeone opened the door and saw us. A reanimation team raced in,zapped the man with a defibrillator and pulled him out. \nI never had to revive anyone before, but it worked the first time\nbecause I had five years of training. When the time came to act, I didn’thave to think. The point of training is to make actions automatic, allow-ing us to concentrate on strategy.\nWhat will you do if your stock jumps five points in your favor? Five\npoints against you? What if your future goes limit up? Limit down? If youhave to stop and think while you’re in a trade, you’re dead. You needto spend time preparing trading plans and deciding in advance whatyou will do when the market does any imaginable thing. Play those sce-narios in your head, use your computer, and get yourself to the pointwhere you do not have to ruminate about what to do if the market jumps.\nThe mature trader arrives at a stage where most trading actions have\nbecome nearly automatic. This gives you the freedom to think aboutstrategy. You think about what you want to achieve, and less about tac-tics of how to achieve it. To reach that point, you need to trade for along time. The longer you trade and the more trades you put on, themore you’ll learn. Trade a small size while learning and put on manytrades. Remember, the first item on the agenda for a beginner is tolearn how to trade, not to make money. Once you’ve learned to trade,money will follow.66 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nCHAPTER\nFIVE\nMETHOD—\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS\nWill this stock rise or fall? Should you go long or short? Traders reach\nfor a multitude of tools to find answers to these questions. Many tie\nthemselves into knots trying to choose between pattern recognition, com-puterized indicators, artificial intelligence, or even astrology for some des-perate souls.\nNo one can learn all the analytic methods, just as no one can master\nevery field of medicine. A physician cannot become a specialist in heartsurgery, obstetrics, and psychiatry. No trader can know everything aboutthe markets. You have to find a niche that attracts you and specialize in it.\nMarkets emit huge volumes of information. Our tools help organize\nthese flows into a manageable form. It is important to select analytic toolsand techniques that make sense to you, put them together into a coherentsystem, and focus on money management. When we make our tradingdecisions at the right edge of the chart, we deal with probabilities, not cer-tainties. If you want certainty, go to the middle of the chart and try to finda broker who will accept your orders.\nThis chapter on technical analysis shows how one trader goes about\nanalyzing markets. Use it as a model for choosing your favorite tools,rather than following it slavishly. Test any method you like on your owndata because only personal testing will convert information into knowl-edge and make these methods your own.\nMany concepts in this book are illustrated with charts. I selected them\nfrom a broad range of markets—stocks as well as futures. Technical analy-sis is a universal language, even though the accents differ. You can applywhat you’ve learned from the chart of IBM to silver or Japanese yen. I trademostly in the United States, but have used the same methods in Germany,\n67\nRussia, Singapore, and Australia. Knowing the language of technical analy-\nsis enables you to read any market in the world.\nAnalysis is hard, but trading is much harder. Charts reflect what has\nhappened. Indicators reveal the balance of power between bulls andbears. Analysis is not an end in itself, unless you get a job as an analystfor a company. Our job as traders is to make decisions to buy, sell, orstand aside on the basis of our analysis.\nAfter reviewing each chart, you need to go to its hard right edge and\ndecide whether to bet on bulls, bet on bears, or stand aside. You mustfollow up chart analysis by establishing profit targets, setting stops, andapplying money management rules.\nBASICCHARTING\nA trade is a bet on a price change. You can make money buying low andselling high or shorting high and covering low. Prices are central to ourenterprise, yet few traders stop to think what prices are. What exactly arewe trying to analyze?\nFinancial markets consist of huge crowds of people who meet on the\nfloor of an exchange, on the phone, or via the Internet. We can dividethem into three groups: buyers, sellers, and undecided traders. Buyerswant to buy as cheaply as possible. Sellers want to sell as expensively aspossible. They could take forever to negotiate, but feel pressure fromundecided traders. They have to act quickly, before some undecidedtrader makes up his mind, jumps into the game, and takes away their bar-gain. Undecided traders are the force that speeds up trading. They are truemarket participants, as long as they watch the market and have the moneyto trade it. Each deal is struck in the midst of the market crowd, puttingpressure on both buyers and sellers. This is why each trade represents thecurrent emotional state of the entire market crowd.\nPrice is a consensus of value of all market participants expressed in\naction at the moment of the trade.\nMany traders have no clear idea what they are trying to analyze. Balance\nsheets of companies? Pronouncements of the Federal Reserve? Weatherreports from soybean-growing states? The cosmic vibrations of Gann the-ory? Every chart serves as an ongoing poll of the market. Each tick repre-sents a momentary consensus of value of all market participants. High andlow prices, the height of every bar, the angle of every trendline, the dura-tion of every pattern reflect aspects of crowd behavior. Recognizing thesepatterns can help us decide when to bet on bulls or bears.68 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nDuring an election campaign pollsters call thousands of people asking\nhow they’ll vote. Well-designed polls have predictive value, which is whypoliticians pay for them. Financial markets run on a two-party system—bullsand bears, with a huge silent majority of undecided traders who may throwtheir weight to either party. Technical analysis is a poll of market partici-pants. If bulls are on top, we should cover shorts and go long. If bears arestronger, we should go short. If an election is too close to call, a wise traderstands aside. Standing aside is a legitimate market position and the only onein which you can’t lose money.\nIndividual behavior is difficult to predict. Crowds are much more prim-\nitive and their behavior more repetitive and predictable. Our job is not toargue with the crowd, telling it what’s rational or irrational. We need toidentify crowd behavior and decide how likely it is to continue. If thetrend is up and we find that the crowd is growing more optimistic, weshould trade that market from the long side. When we find that the crowdis becoming less optimistic, it is time to sell. If the crowd seems confused,we should stand aside and wait for the market to make up its mind.\nThe Meaning of Prices\nHighs and lows, opening and closing prices, intraday swings and weeklyranges reflect crowd behavior. Our charts, indicators, and technical tools arewindows into the mass psychology of the markets. You have to be clearabout what you are studying if you want to get closer to the truth.\nMany market participants have backgrounds in science and engineering\nand are often tempted to apply the principles of physics. For example, theymay try to filter out the noise of a trading range to obtain a clear signal ofa trend. Those methods can help, but they cannot be converted into auto-matic trading systems because the markets are not physical processes. Theyare reflections of crowd psychology, which follows different, less preciselaws. In physics, if you calculate everything, you’ll predict where a processwill take you. Not so in the markets, where a crowd can always throw youa curve. Here you have to act within this atmosphere of uncertainty, whichis why you must protect yourself with good money management.\nThe Open The opening price, the first price of the day, is marked on a\nbar chart by a tick pointing to the left. An opening price reflects the influxof overnight orders. Who placed those orders? A dentist who read a tip ina magazine after dinner, a teacher whose broker touted a trade but whoneeded his wife’s permission to buy, a financial officer of a slow-movingMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 69\ninstitution who sat in a meeting all day waiting for his idea to be approved\nby a committee. They are the people who place orders before the open.Opening prices reflect opinions of less informed market participants.\nWhen outsiders buy or sell, who takes the opposite side of their trades?\nMarket professionals step in to help, only they do not run a charity. If floortraders see more buy orders coming in, they open the market higher, forc-ing outsiders to overpay. The pros go short, so that the slightest dip makesthem money. If the crowd is fearful before the opening and sell orders pre-dominate, the floor opens the market very low. They acquire their goodson the cheap, so that the slightest bounce earns them short-term profits.\nThe opening price establishes the first balance of the day between out-\nsiders and insiders, amateurs and professionals. If you are a short-termtrader, pay attention to the opening range—the high and the low of thefirst 15 to 30 minutes of trading. Most opening ranges are followed bybreakouts, which are important because they show who is taking controlof the market. Several intraday trading systems are based on followingopening range breakouts.\nOne of the best opportunities to enter a trade occurs when the market gaps\nat the open in the direction opposite your intended trade. Suppose you ana-lyze a market at night and your system tells you to buy a stock. A piece ofbad news hits the market overnight, sell orders come in, and that stock openssharply lower. Once prices stabilize within the opening range, if you are stillbullish and that range is above your planned stop-loss point, place your buyorder a few ticks above the high of the opening range, with a stop below.You may pick up good merchandise on sale!\nThe High Why do prices go up? The standard answer—more buyers\nthan sellers—makes no sense because for every trade there is a buyer anda seller. The market goes up when buyers have more money and are moreenthusiastic than sellers.\nBuyers make money when prices go up. Each uptick adds to their prof-\nits. They feel flushed with success, keep buying, call friends and tell themto buy—this thing is going up! Eventually, prices rise to a level where bullshave no more money to spare and some start taking profits. Bears see themarket as overpriced and hit it with sales. The market stalls, turns, andbegins to fall, leaving behind the high point of the day. That point marksthe greatest power of bulls for that day.\nThe high of every bar reflects the maximum power of bulls during that\nbar. It shows how high bulls could lift the market during that time period.The high of a daily bar reflects the maximum power of bulls during that70 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nday, the high of a weekly bar shows the maximum power of bulls during\nthat week, and the high of a five-minute bar shows their maximum powerin those five minutes.\nThe Low Bears make money when prices fall, with each downtick mak-\ning money for short sellers. As prices slide, bulls become more and moreskittish. They cut back their buying and step aside, figuring they’ll be ableto pick up what they want cheaper at a later time. When buyers pull intheir horns, it becomes easier for bears to push prices lower, and thedecline continues.\nIt takes money to sell stocks short, and a fall in prices slows down when\nbears start running low on money. Bullish bargain hunters appear on thescene. Experienced traders recognize what’s happening and start coveringshorts and going long. Prices rally from their lows, leaving behind the lowmark—the lowest tick of the day.\nThe low point of each bar reflects the maximum power of bears during\nthat bar. The lowest point of a daily bar reflects the maximum power ofbears during that day, the low point of a weekly bar shows the maximumpower of bears during that week, and the low of a five-minute bar showsthe maximum power of bears during those five minutes. Several years agoI designed an indicator, called Elder-ray, for tracking the relative power ofbulls and bears by measuring how far the high and the low of each barget away from the average price.\nThe Close The closing price is marked on a bar chart by a tick pointing\nto the right. It reflects the final consensus of value for the day. This is theprice at which most people look in their daily newspapers. It is especiallyimportant in the futures markets, because the settlement of tradingaccounts depends on it.\nProfessional traders monitor markets throughout the day. Early in the\nday they take advantage of opening prices, selling high openings andbuying low openings, and then unwinding those positions. Their normalmode of operations is to fade—trade against—market extremes and for thereturn to normalcy. When prices reach a new high and stall, professionalssell, nudging the market down. When prices stabilize after a fall, they buy,helping the market rally.\nThe waves of buying and selling by amateurs that hit the market at the\nopening usually subside as the day goes on. Outsiders have done whatthey planned to do, and near the closing time the market is dominated byprofessional traders.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 71\nClosing prices reflect the opinions of professionals. Look at any chart,\nand you’ll see how often the opening and closing ticks are at the oppo-site ends of a price bar. This is because amateurs and professionals tendto be on the opposite sides of trades.\nCandlesticks and Point and Figure Bar charts are most widely used for\ntracking prices, but there are other methods. Candlestick charts becamepopular in the West in the 1990s. Each candle represents a day of tradingwith a body and two wicks, one above and another below. The bodyreflects the spread between the opening and closing prices. The tip of theupper wick reaches the highest price of the day and the lower wick thelowest price of the day. Candlestick chartists believe that the relationshipbetween the opening and closing prices is the most important piece ofdaily data. If prices close higher than they opened, the body of the can-dle is white, but if prices close lower, the body is black.\nThe height of a candle body and the length of its wicks reflect the battles\nbetween bulls and bears. Those patterns, as well as patterns formed by sev-eral neighboring candles, provide useful insights into the power struggle inthe m arkets and can help us decide whether to go long or short.\nThe trouble with candles is they are too fat. I can glance at a computer\nscreen with a bar chart and see five to six months of daily data, withoutsqueezing the scale. Put a candlestick chart in the same space, and you’llbe lucky to get two months of data on the screen. Ultimately, a candle-stick chart doesn’t reveal anything more than a bar chart. If you draw anormal bar chart and pay attention to the relationships of opening andclosing prices, augmenting that with several technical indicators, you’ll beable to read the markets just as well and perhaps better. Candlestickcharts are useful for some but not all traders. If you like them, use them.If not, focus on your bar charts and don’t worry about missing somethingessential.\nPoint and figure (P&F) charts are based solely on prices, ignoring vol-\nume. They differ from bar and candlestick charts by having no horizontaltime scale. When markets become inactive, P&F charts stop drawingbecause they add a new column of X’s and O’s only when prices changebeyond a certain trigger point. P&F charts make congestion areas standout, helping traders find support and resistance and providing targets forreversals and profit taking. P&F charts are much older than bar charts.Professionals in the pits sometimes scribble them on the backs of theirtrading decks.72 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nChoosing a chart is a matter of personal choice. Pick the one that feels\nmost comfortable. I prefer bar charts but know many serious traders wholike P&F charts or candlestick charts.\nThe Reality of the Chart\nPrice ticks coalesce into bars, and bars into patterns, as the crowd writes itsemotional diary on the screen. Successful traders learn to recognize a fewpatterns and trade them. They wait for a familiar pattern to emerge like fisher-men wait for a nibble at a riverbank where they fished many times in the past.\nMany amateurs jump from one stock to another, but professionals tend\nto trade the same markets for years. They learn their intended catch’s per-sonality, its habits and quirks. When professionals see a short-term bottomin a familiar stock, they recognize a bargain and buy. Their buying checksthe decline and pushes the stock up. When prices rise, the pros reducetheir buying, but amateurs rush in, sucked in by the good news. Whenmarkets become overvalued, professionals start unloading their inventory.Their selling checks the rise and pushes the market down. Amateursbecome spooked and start dumping their holdings, accelerating thedecline. Once weak holders have been shaken out, prices slide to the levelwhere professionals see a bottom, and the cycle repeats.\nThat cycle is not mathematically perfect, which is why mechanical sys-\ntems tend not to work. Using technical indicators requires judgment. Beforewe review specific chart patterns, let us agree on the basic definitions:\nAnuptrend is a pattern in which most rallies reach a higher point than the\npreceding rally; most declines stop at a higher level than the precedingdecline.\nAdowntrend is a pattern in which most declines fall to a lower point than\nthe preceding decline; most rallies rise to a lower level than the pre-ceding rally.\nAnuptrendline is a line connecting two or more adjacent bottoms, slant-\ning upwards; if we draw a line parallel to it across the tops, we’ll havea trading channel.\nAdowntrendline is a line connecting two or more adjacent tops, slanting\ndown; one can draw a parallel line across the bottoms, marking a trad-ing channel.\nSupport is marked by a horizontal line connecting two or more adjacent\nbottoms. One can often draw a parallel line across the tops, marking atrading range.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 73\nResistance is marked by a horizontal line connecting two or more adjacent\ntops. One can often draw a parallel line below, across the bottoms, tomark a trading range.\nTops and Bottoms The tops of rallies mark the areas of the maximum\npower of bulls. They would love to lift prices even higher and make moremoney, but that’s where they get overpowered by bears. The bottoms ofdeclines, on the other hand, are the areas of maximum power of bears. Theywould love to push prices even lower and profit from short positions, butthey get overpowered by bulls. \nUse a computer or a ruler to draw a line, connecting nearby tops. If it\nslants up, it shows that bulls are becoming stronger, which is a goodthing to know if you plan to trade from the long side. If that line slantsdown, it shows that bulls are becoming weaker, and buying is not such agood idea.\nTrendlines applied to market bottoms help visualize changes in the\npower of bears. When a line connecting two nearby bottoms slants down,it shows that bears are growing stronger, and short selling is a goodoption. If that line slants up, however, it shows that bears are becomingweaker.\nWhen the lines connecting the tops and the lines connecting the bottoms\nare close to horizontal, the market is locked in a trading range. We can eitherwait for a breakout or trade short-term swings within that range.\nUptrendlines and Downtrendlines Prices often appear to travel along\ninvisible roads. When peaks rise higher at each successive rally, prices arein an uptrend. When bottoms keep falling lower and lower, prices are ina downtrend.\nWe can identify uptrends by drawing trendlines connecting the bottoms\nof declines. We use bottoms to identify an uptrend because the peaks ofrallies tend to be expansive, uneven affairs during uptrends. The declinestend to be more orderly, and when you connect them with a trendline,you get a truer picture of that uptrend.\nWe identify downtrends by drawing trendlines across the peaks of ral-\nlies. Each new low in a downtrend tends to be lower than the precedinglow, but the panic among weak holders can make bottoms irregularlysharp. Drawing a downtrendline across the tops of rallies paints a morecorrect picture of that downtrend.\nThe most important feature of a trendline is the direction of its slope.\nWhen it rises, the bulls are in control, and when it declines, the bears are74 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nin charge. The longer the trendline and the more points of contact it has\nwith prices, the more valid it is. The angle of a trendline reflects the emo-tional temperature of the crowd. Quiet, shallow trends can last a long time.As trends accelerate, trendlines have to be redrawn, making them steeper.When they rise or fall at 60° or more, their breaks tend to lead to majorreversals. This sometimes happens near the tail ends of runaway moves.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 75\nFigure 5.1 Trendlines; Kangaroo Tails\nDraw uptrendlines across the bottoms to mark uptrends. Draw downtrend-\nlines across the tops to mark downtrends. Notice that prices can briefly pen-etrate a trendline without breaking the trend. Observe that prices seem\nattached to their trendlines with rubber bands that extend only so far in any\ngiven trend. You want to establish positions in the direction of the slope of atrendline, entering reasonably close to it. By the time the trend reaches a newhigh or low, that swing away from the trendline is getting old—there is notmuch life left in the old dog. At the right edge of this chart the trend is down\nand the swing has fallen as far below its trendline as any since May. If you\nare short, it is time to start thinking of taking profits.\nNotice several bars that stick out of the tight weave of prices at the bot-\ntoms in May, November, and April, as well as the latest top in May. Those arekangaroo tails, which tend to mark turning points. The market tests a new\nhigh or a new low with a bar that is much taller than the preceding and fol-\nlowing bars, and then recoils from that price extreme. You can recognize atail during the bar that follows, and trade against it.\nYou can plot these lines using a ruler or a computer. It is better to\ndraw trendlines as well as support and resistance lines across the edges ofcongestion areas instead of price extremes. Congestion areas reflect crowdbehavior, while the extreme points show only the panic among the weak-est crowd members.\nTails—The Kangaroo Pattern Trends take a long time to form, but tails\nare created in just a few days. They provide valuable insights into marketpsychology, mark reversal areas, and point to trading opportunities.\nA tail is a one-day spike in the direction of a trend, followed by a reversal.\nIt takes a minimum of three bars to create a tail—relatively narrow bars inthe beginning and at the end, with an extremely wide bar in the middle.That middle bar is the tail, but you won’t know for sure until the follow-ing day, when a bar has sharply narrowed back at the base, letting the tailhang out. A tail sticks out from a tight weave of prices—you can’t miss it.\nA kangaroo, unlike a horse or a dog, propels itself by pushing with its\ntail. You can always tell which way a kangaroo is going to jump—oppositeits tail. When the tail points north, the kangaroo jumps south, and whenthe tail points south, it jumps north. Market tails tend to occur at turningpoints in the markets, which recoil from them like kangaroos recoil fromtheir tails. A tail does not forecast the extent of a move, but the first jumpusually lasts a few days, offering a trading opportunity. You can do well byrecognizing tails and trading against them.\nBefore you trade any pattern, you must understand what it tells you\nabout the market. Why do markets jump away from their tails?\nExchanges are owned by members who profit from volume rather than\ntrends. Markets fluctuate, looking for price levels that will bring the high-est volume of orders. Members do not know where those levels are, butthey keep probing higher and lower. A tail shows that the market hastested a certain price level and rejected it.\nIf a market stabs down and recoils, it shows that lower prices do not\nattract volume. The natural thing for the market to do next is rally and testhigher levels to see whether higher prices will bring more volume. If themarket stabs higher and recoils, leaving a tail pointing upward, it showsthat higher prices do not attract volume. The members are likely to sell themarket down in order to find whether lower prices will attract volume. Tailswork because the owners of the market are looking to maximize income.\nWhenever you see a very tall bar (several times the average for recent\nmonths) shooting in the direction of the existing trend, be alert to the pos-sibility of a tail. If the following day the market traces a very narrow bar76 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nat the base of the tall bar, it completes a tail. Be ready to put on a posi-\ntion, trading against that tail, before the close.\nWhen a market hangs down a tail, go long in the vicinity of the base of\nthat tail. Once long, place a protective stop approximately half-way down\nthe tail. If the market starts chewing its tail, run without delay. The targetsfor profit taking on these long positions are best established by using movingaverages and channels (see “Indicators—Five Bullets to a Clip,” page 84).\nWhen a market puts up a tail, go short in the area of the base of that tail.\nOnce short, place a protective stop approximately half-way up the tail. Ifthe market starts rallying up its tail, it is time to run; do not wait for theentire tail to be chewed up. Establish profit-taking targets using movingaverages and channels.\nYou can trade against tails in any timeframe. Daily charts are most com-\nmon, but you can also trade them on intraday or weekly charts. The mag-nitude of a move depends on its timeframe. A tail on a weekly chart willgenerate a much bigger move than a tail on a five-minute chart.\nSupport, Resistance, and False Breakouts When most traders and\ninvestors buy and sell, they make an emotional as well as a financial com-mitment to their trade. Their emotions can propel market trends or sendthem into reversals.\nThe longer a market trades at a certain level, the more people buy and\nsell. Suppose a stock falls from 80 and trades near 70 for several weeks,until many believe that it has found support and reached its bottom. Whathappens if heavy selling comes in and shoves that stock down to 60? Smartlongs will run fast, banging out at 69 or 68. Others will sit through theentire painful decline. If losers haven’t given up near 60 and are still alivewhen the market trades back towards 70, their pain will prompt them tojump at a chance to “get out even.” Their selling is likely to cap a rally, atleast temporarily. Their painful memories are the reason why the areasthat served as support on the way down become resistance on the wayup, and vice versa.\nRegret is another psychological force behind support and resistance. If\na stock trades at 80 for a while and then rallies to 95, those who did notbuy it near 80 feel as if they missed the train. If that stock sinks back near80, traders who regret a missed opportunity will return to buy in force.\nSupport and resistance can remain active for months or even years\nbecause investors have long memories. When prices return to their oldlevels, some jump at the opportunity to add to their positions while otherssee a chance to get out.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 77\nWhenever you work with a chart, draw support and resistance lines across\nrecent tops and bottoms. Expect a trend to slow down in those areas, anduse them to enter positions or take profits. Keep in mind that support andresistance are flexible—they are like a ranch wire fence rather than a glasswall. A glass wall is rigid and shatters when broken, but a herd of bulls canpush against a wire fence, shove their muzzles through it, and it will leanbut stand. Markets have many false breakouts below support and aboveresistance, with prices returning into their range after a brief violation.\nA false upside breakout occurs when the market rises above resistance\nand sucks in buyers before reversing and falling. A false downside break-out occurs when prices fall below support, attracting more bears just beforea rally. False breakouts provide professionals with some of the best tradingopportunities. They are similar to tails, only tails have a single wide bar,whereas false breakouts can have several bars, none of them especially tall.\nWhat causes false breakouts and how do you trade them? At the end of\na long rise the market hits resistance, stops, and starts churning. The pro-fessionals know there are many more buy orders above the resistancelevel. Some were placed by traders looking to buy a new breakout, andothers are protective stops placed by those who went short on the wayup. The pros are the first to know where people have stops because theyare the ones holding the orders.\nA false breakout occurs when the pros organize a fishing expedition to\nrun stops. For example, when a stock is slightly below its resistance at 60,the floor may start loading up on longs near 58.85. As sellers pull back, themarket roars above 60, setting off buy stops. The floor starts selling into thatrush, unloading longs as prices touch 60.50. When they see that public buyorders are drying up, they sell short and prices tank back below 60. That’swhen your charts show a false breakout above 60.\nS&P 500 futures are notorious for false breakouts. Day after day this\nmarket exceeds its previous day’s high or falls below its previous day’slow by a few ticks (a tick is the minimum price change permitted bythe exchange where an instrument is traded). This is one of the reasonsthe S&P is a difficult market to trade, but it attracts beginners like flies. Thefloor has a field day slapping them.\nSome of the best trading opportunities occur after false breakouts. When\nprices fall back into the range after a false upside breakout, you have extraconfidence to trade short. Use the top of the false breakout as your stop-loss point. Once prices rally back into their range after a false downsidebreakout, you have extra confidence to trade long. Use the bottom of thatfalse breakout for your stop-loss point.78 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nIf you have an open position, defend yourself against false breakouts\nby reducing your trading size and placing wider stops. Be ready to repo-sition if stopped out of your trade.\nThere are many advantages to risking just a small fraction of your\naccount on any trade. It allows you to be more flexible with stops. Whenthe volatility is high, consider protecting a long position by buying a putor a short position by buying a call. Finally, if you get stopped out on afalse breakout, don’t be shy about getting back into a trade. Beginnerstend to make a single stab at a position and stay out if they are stoppedout. Professionals, on the other hand, will attempt several entries beforenailing down the trade they want.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 79\nFigure 5.2 Support, Resistance, and False Breakouts\nIn September CIEN reached a peak below 140, then attacked that level in\nOctober and rallied above 150, only to sink below the old peak a few days\nlater. Some poor guy actually bought above 150—he really needed that stock!\nThe false upside breakout marked the end of the bull market.\nThe bear market established a bottom just near 65 in December, but in\nJanuary some desperate sellers dumped enough stock to briefly push CIENnear 60. At the right edge of the chart prices are rallying above the level oftheir old bottom. The bear trap has slammed shut, with a 50% rally in just\none month. Such signals are much easier to recognize using technical indi-\ncators, to be discussed later.\nDouble Tops and Bottoms Bulls make money when the market rises.\nThere are always a few who take profits on the way up, but new bullscome in and the rally continues. Every rally reaches a point where enoughbulls look at it and say—this is very nice, and it may get even nicer, butI’d rather have cash. Rallies top out after enough wealthy bulls take theirprofits, while the money from new bulls is not enough to replace whatwas taken out.\nWhen the market heads down from its peak, savvy bulls, the ones\nwho’ve cashed out early, are the most relaxed group. Other bulls who arestill long, especially if they came in late, feel trapped. Their profits aremelting away and turning into losses. Should they hold or sell?\nIf enough moneyed bulls decide the decline is being overdone, they’ll\nstep in and buy. As the rally resumes, more bulls come in. Now pricesapproach the level of their old top, and that’s where you can expect sellorders to hit the market. Many traders who got caught in the previousdecline swear to get out if the market gives them a second chance.\nAs the market rises toward its previous peak, the main question is\nwhether it will it rise to a new high or form a double top and turn down.Technical indicators can be of great help in answering this question. Whenthey rise to a new high, they tell you to hold, and when they form bear-80 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nFigure 5.3 Double Tops and Bottoms; Volume\nABC D\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 81\nish divergences (see “Indicators—Five Bullets to a Clip,” page 84), they tell\nyou to take profits at the second top.\nA mirror image of this situation occurs at market bottoms. The market\nfalls to a new low at which enough smart bears start covering shorts andthe market rallies. Once that rally peters out and prices start sinking again,all eyes are on the previous low—will it hold? If bears are strong and bullsskittish, prices will break below the first low, and the downtrend will con-tinue. If bears are weak and bulls are strong, the decline will stop in thevicinity of the old low, creating a double bottom. Technical indicators helpdecipher which of the two is more likely to happen.\nTriangles A triangle is a congestion area, a pause when winners take\nprofits and new trend followers get aboard, while their opponents tradeagainst the preceding trend. It is like a train station. The train stops to letpassengers off and pick up new ones, but there is always a chance this isthe last stop on the line and it may turn back.\nThe upper boundary of a triangle shows where sellers overpower buy-\ners and prevent the market from rising. The lower boundary shows where\nbuyers overpower sellers and prevent the market from falling. As the twostart to converge, you know a breakout is coming. As a general rule, theCallaway Golf (ELY) reached its high of 27.18 in March, at point A, and strug-\ngled again near that level, to 26.95 in April, at point B. A few days after it\nrecoiled from B, the double top became clearly visible. Many indicators\n(which we will review later) traced bearish divergences at that time.\nIn June the stock collapsed, as the aged founder of the company, the inven-\ntor of the famous Big Bertha golf club, became ill and died. In a fairly typicalemotional reaction, people dumped their stock without stopping to think\nwhether the demise of an individual would ruin a large, well-established com-\npany. Such declines feed on themselves, as lower prices scare more peopleinto selling. Notice a fantastic spike of volume, which reflected mass panic.The low at point C looks like a kangaroo tail, although not in its most classicalform. Prices rallied above 17 at point D in what is called “a dead cat bounce,”not out of any great bullishness but simply as a reaction to the decline.\nAt the right edge of the chart ELY is grinding down towards its recent bot-\ntom on low volume. If it recoils from that level, it’ll establish a double bottom.This is a fairly typical pattern—a crash, followed by a dead cat bounce, fol-lowed by a slow decline into the second bottom. Once prices rally from thesecond low, they are likely to usher in a sustainable rise.\ntrend that preceded the triangle deserves the benefit of the doubt. The\nangles between triangle walls reflect the balance of power between bullsand bears and hint at the likely direction of a breakout.\nAn ascending triangle has a flat upper boundary and a rising lower\nboundary. The flat upper line shows that bears have drawn a line in thesand and sell whenever the market comes to it. They must be a pretty82 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nFigure 5.4 Triangles, Pennants, and Rectangles\nCharts patterns are the footprints of bulls and bears. Patterns A and D are\ncalled pennants —a tight weave of prices that follows a sharp move up or\ndown its flagpole. When a pennant flies in the direction of the trend (A), it is\nusually followed by a sharp reversal. When it flies against the preceding trend\n(D), it is a consolidation pattern and the trend usually continues. Place yourentry orders accordingly, above or below a pennant’s boundary.\nPattern B is a symmetrical triangle and pattern C is an ascending triangle.\nBreakouts from triangles tend to follow the trends that preceded them, espe-\ncially when triangles are compact, consisting of only a few bars. Pattern E is\na rectangle; notice how bulls and bears push against the rectangle walls, cre-\nating brief false breakouts—do not jump in too early. When prices decisively\nbreak out of a rectangle, the reversal is complete.\nAt the right edge of the chart, prices are below a rectangle that provides\nsevere overhead resistance; the price is like a drowning man under an ice\nfloe. The trend is down, with rallies presenting shorting opportunities.\nA\nBCDE\npowerful group, calmly waiting for prices to come to them before unload-\ning. At the same time buyers are becoming more aggressive. They snap upmerchandise and keep raising the floor under the market.\nOn what party should you bet? Nobody knows who’ll win the election,\nbut savvy traders tend to place buy orders slightly above the upper line ofan ascending triangle. Since sellers are on the defensive, if the attackingbulls succeed, the breakout is likely to be steep. This is the logic of buy-ing upside breakouts from ascending triangles.\nA descending triangle has a flat lower boundary and a declining upper\nboundary. The horizontal lower line shows that bulls are pretty deter-mined, calmly waiting to buy at a certain level. At the same time, sellersare becoming more aggressive. They keep selling at lower and lower lev-els, pushing the market closer to the line drawn by buyers.\nAs a trader, which way will you bet—on the bulls or the bears? Expe-\nrienced traders tend to place their orders to sell short slightly below thelower line of a descending triangle. Let buyers defend that line, but if bullscollapse after a long defense, a break is likely to be sharp. This is the logicof shorting downside breakouts from descending triangles.\nA symmetrical triangle shows that both bulls and bears are equally con-\nfident. Bulls keep paying up, and bears keep selling lower. Neither groupis backing off, and their fight must be resolved before prices reach the tipof the triangle. The breakout is likely to go in the direction of the trendthat preceded the triangle.\nVolume Each unit of volume represents the actions of two individuals—\na buyer and a seller. It can be measured by several numbers: shares, con-tracts, or dollars that have changed hands. Volume is usually plotted as ahistogram below prices. It provides important clues about the actions ofbulls and bears. Rising volume tends to confirm trends, and falling volumebrings them into question.\nVolume reflects the level of pain among market participants. At each\ntick in every trade, one person is winning and the other losing. Marketscan move only if enough new losers enter the game to supply profits towinners. If the market is falling, it takes a very courageous or reckless bullto step in and buy, but without him there is no increase in volume. Whenthe trend is up, it takes a very brave or reckless bear to step in and sell.Rising volume shows that losers are continuing to come in, allowing thetrend to continue. When losers start abandoning the market, volume falls,and the trend runs out of steam. Volume gives traders several useful clues.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 83\nA one-day splash of uncommonly high volume often marks the begin-\nning of a trend when it accompanies a breakout from a trading range. Asimilar splash tends to mark the end of a trend if it occurs during a well-established move. Exceedingly high volume, three or more times above\naverage, identifies market hysteria. That is when nervous bulls finallydecide that the uptrend is for real and rush in to buy or nervous bearsbecome convinced that the decline has no bottom and jump in to sell short.\nDivergences between price and volume tend to occur at turning points.\nWhen prices rise to a new high but volume shrinks, it shows that theuptrend attracts less interest. When prices fall to a new low and volumefalls, it shows that lower prices attract little interest and an upside reversalis likely. Price is more important than volume, but good traders alwaysanalyze volume to gauge the degree of crowd involvement. For a moreobjective rating of volume use an indicator called Force Index (see nextsection). Changes in volume detected by Force Index give important mes-sages to traders.\nINDICATORS —FIVEBULLETS TO A CLIP\nI had a friend who drove a tank in World War ll, fighting his way fromStalingrad to Vienna. He maintained his tank with only three tools—a bighammer, a big screwdriver, and the Russian version of “f... you.” He wonthe war with a few simple tools, and we can apply his lessons to the dan-gerous environment of the markets.\nAn amateur tries to grab a bit of money here and there. He uses one\ntechnique today and another tomorrow. His mind is scattered and he keepslosing, enriching only his broker and floor traders. A new hunter walks intothe woods with a load of fancy gear on his back but soon discovers thatmost of it only slows him down. An experienced woodsman travels light.\nA beginner shoots at anything that moves, including his own shadow.\nAn old hunter knows exactly what prey he is after and brings only a fewbullets. Simplicity and discipline go hand in hand. To be a successfultrader, choose a small number of markets, select a few tools, and learn touse them well. If you follow five stocks, your research will be deeper andresults better than if you follow 50. If you use five indicators, you’ll getmore mileage out of them than out of 25. You can always expand later,once you make steady profits.\nThe indicators we are about to discuss represent the choice of one\ntrader. I call this approach “five bullets to a clip.” An old army rifle used totake five bullets, and I analyze markets using no more than five indicators.84 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nIf five do not help, 10 will not do any better because there probably is no\ntrade. I offer you this list as a starting point for selecting your own bullets.Pay attention to the general principle of selecting indicators from differentgroups to focus on different aspects of crowd behavior. The key idea is toselect a few core tools that fit your style of analysis and trading.\nThe tools we are about to review—moving averages, envelopes, MACD,\nMACD-Histogram, and Force Index—are the building blocks of a trading sys-tem described in the following chapter. There is no magic indicator; they allhave advantages and disadvantages. It is important to be aware of bothbecause then we can combine several indicators into a system to take advan-tage of their strengths, while their disadvantages cancel each other out.\nChoice of Tools\nMarkets can confound traders. They often run in two directions at once—up on the weekly charts and down on the dailies. A market can reversewithout sending you an e-mail about its change of plans. A sleepy stockcan get so hot that it burns through stops, while a formerly hot stockbecomes so cold it freezes your capital along with your fingers.\nTrading is a complex, nontrivial game. Markets consist of huge crowds\nof people, and technical analysis is applied social psychology. We mustselect several tools to identify different aspects of market behavior. Beforeusing any indicator, we must understand how it is constructed and what itmeasures. We must test it on historical data and learn how it performsunder different conditions. Once you start testing an indicator, expect toadjust its settings, turning it into a personal trading tool as reliable andfamiliar as an old wrench.\nToolboxes vs. Black Boxes I keep seeing ads in traders’ magazines that\nshow computers with $100 bills coming out of their disk drives. I’d love toget a hold of one of those models. The only ones I could find have the direc-tion of money reversed. Computers can chew up cash, but pulling it out ofthem takes a lot of hard work. Those ads sell black boxes—computerizedtrading systems. Some clown has programmed a bunch of trading rules, putthem on a copy-protected diskette or a CD, and now sells you a tool with agreat track record. Feed it market data, and it will spit out an answer—whento buy or sell! If you believe this magic, wait until you meet Santa Claus.\nA fantastic track record of a canned system is meaningless because it\ncomes from fitting the rules to old data. Any computer can tell you whichrules worked in the past. Black-box programs self-destruct as soon as theMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 85\nmarkets change, even if they include self-optimization. Black boxes appeal\nto beginners who derive a false sense of security from them.\nA good software package is a toolbox—a collection of tools for analyz-\ning markets and making your own decisions. A toolbox can downloaddata, draw charts, and plot indicators, as well as any trading signals youcare to program. It provides charting and analytic tools but leaves you tomake your own trading decisions.\nThe heart of any toolbox is its collection of indicators—tools for iden-\ntifying trends and reversals behind the noise of raw data. Good toolboxesallow you to modify indicators and even design your own. Indicators areobjective; you may argue about the trend, but when an indicator is up, it’sup, and when it is down, it’s down. Keep in mind that indicators arederived from prices. The more complicated they are, the farther they arefrom prices and the farther away from reality. Prices are primary, indica-tors are secondary, and simple indicators work best.\nTrend-Following Indicators and Oscillators Learning to use indicators\nis like learning a foreign language. You have to immerse yourself in them,make typical beginners’ mistakes, and keep practicing until you rise to thelevel of proficiency and competence.\nGood technical indicators are simple tools that perform well when\nmarket conditions change. They are robust, that is, relatively immune toparameter changes. If an indicator gives great signals using a 17-day win-dow but bombs when you try a 15-day window, then it’s probably use-less. Good indicators give useful signals at a broad range of settings.\nWe can divide all technical indicators into three major groups: trend-fol-\nlowing, oscillators, and miscellaneous. Whenever we use an indicator, wemust know to which group it belongs. Each group has its advantages anddisadvantages.\nTrend-following indicators include moving averages, MACD (moving\naverage convergence-divergence), Directional System, and others. Big trends\nmean big money, and these indicators help us stay long in uptrends andshort in downtrends. They have built-in inertia that allows them to lockonto a trend and ride it. That same inertia causes them to lag at turningpoints. Their advantages and disadvantages are the flip sides of each other,and you cannot have one without the other.\nOscillators include Force Index, Rate of Change, and Stochastic, among\nothers. They help catch turning points by showing when markets are\noverbought (too high and ready to fall) or oversold (too low and ready to86 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nrise). Oscillators work great in trading ranges, where they catch upturns\nand downturns. Taking their signals when prices are relatively flat is likegoing to a cash machine—you always get something, although not verymuch. Their downside is that they give premature sell signals in uptrendsand buy signals in downtrends.\nMiscellaneous indicators, such as Bullish Consensus, Commitments of\nTraders, and New High–New Low Index, gauge the current mood of themarket. They show whether the overall bullishness or bearishness is ris-\ning or falling.\nIndicators from different groups often contradict one another. For example,\nwhen markets rise, trend-following indicators turn up, telling us to buy. At thesame time, oscillators become overbought and start flashing sell signals. Theopposite occurs in downtrends, when trend-following indicators turn down,giving sell signals, while oscillators become oversold, flashing buy signals.Which should we follow? The answers are easy in the middle of a chart, butmuch harder at the right edge, where we must make our trading decisions.\nSome beginners close their eyes to complexity, choose a single indi-\ncator, and stick to it until the market whacks them from an unexpecteddirection. Others create a homemade opinion poll; they take a battery ofindicators and average their signals. This is a meaningless exercise be-cause its outcome depends on what indicators you include in your poll;change the selection and you’ll change the outcome. The Triple Screentrading system, described below, overcomes the problem of conflictingindicators by linking them with different timeframes.\nTime—The Factor of Five A computer screen can comfortably show\nabout 120 bars in an open-high-low-close format. What if you display amonthly chart, each of whose bars represents one month? You’ll see 10years worth of history at a glance, your stock’s big picture. You can displaya weekly chart and review its rallies and declines for the past two years. Adaily chart will show you the action for the past few months. How aboutan hourly chart, each of whose bars represents one hour of trading? It willlet you zoom in on the past few days and pick up short-term trends. Wantto get even closer? How about a 10-minute chart, each of whose bars rep-resents 10 minutes of market action?\nLooking at all these charts, you quickly notice that markets can move in\ndifferent directions at the same time. You may see an upmove on theweekly chart, while the dailies are breaking down. An hourly chart may besagging, while a 10-minute chart is rallying. Which trend to follow?METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 87\nMost beginners look at only one timeframe, usually daily. The trouble is\nthat a new trend, erupting from another timeframe, often hurts traders whodo not look beyond their noses. Another serious problem is that looking atthe daily chart puts you on par with thousands of other traders who alsolook at it. What’s your advantage, what’s your edge?\nMarkets are so complex that we must always analyze them in more than\none timeframe. The Factor of Five, first described in Trading for a Living ,\nlinks all timeframes. Every timeframe is related to the next higher and thenext lower by the factor of five. There are almost five (4.3 to be exact) weeksto a month, five days to a week, and close to five hours in many trading days.We can break an hour into 10-minute segments and those into 2-minute bars.\nThe key principle of Triple Screen, which we will review later, is to\nchoose your favorite timeframe and then immediately go up to the time-frame one order of magnitude higher. There we make a strategic decisionto go long or short. We return to our favorite timeframe to make tacticaldecisions about where to enter, exit, place a profit target and a stop.Adding the dimension of time to our analysis gives us an edge over thecompetition.\nUse at least two, but not more than three, timeframes because adding more\nonly clutters up the decision-making process. If you are day-trading with30- and five-minute charts, then a weekly chart is essentially irrelevant. If you\nare trading market swings using a weekly and a daily, then the wiggles of afive-minute chart are no more than noise. Choose your favorite timeframe,add the timeframe one order of magnitude higher, and start your analysis atthat point.\nMoving Averages\nMoving averages (MAs) are among the oldest, simplest, and most usefultools for traders. They help identify trends and find areas for enteringtrades. We plot them as lines on price charts, each of whose points reflectsthe latest average price.\nWhat is the reality behind the moving averages, and what do they measure?\nEach price is a momentary consensus of value among market partici-\npants, a snapshot of the market crowd at the moment of a trade. What ifyou show me a snapshot of your friend and ask whether he is an optimistor a pessimist, a bull or a bear? It is hard to tell from a single photo. If youtake his snapshot from the same position for 10 days in a row and bringthem to a lab, you can get a composite photo. When 10 pictures are super-88 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nimposed upon one another, the typical features stand out, while the atypi-\ncal fade away. If you start updating that composite each day, you’ll have amoving average of your friend’s mood. If you lay a string of compositephotos side by side, it will be clear whether your friend is becoming hap-pier or sadder.\nA moving average is a composite photograph of the market. It adds\nnew prices as they occur and drops old ones. A rising moving averageshows that the crowd is becoming more optimistic—bullish. A fallingmoving average shows that the crowd is becoming more pessimistic—bearish.\nA moving average responds not only to the data but to how we con-\nstruct it. We must make several decisions to help separate the message ofour moving average from the construction noise. First, we need to decidewhat data we’ll use. We need to select the width of our time window—wider for catching longer trends, narrower for catching minor ones.Finally, we need to choose the type of moving average.\nWhat Data to Average? Traders who rely on daily and weekly charts\nusually apply moving averages to closing prices. This makes sense,because they reflect the final consensus of value, the most important priceof the day.\nThe closing price of a five-minute or an hourly bar has no such special\nmeaning. Day-traders are better off averaging not closing prices, but anaverage price of each bar. For example, they can average Open +High +\nLow +Close of each bar, divided by four, or High +Low +Close divided\nby three.\nWe can apply moving averages to indicators, such as Force Index (see\nbelow). A raw Force Index reflects price changes and volume for the day.Averaging produces a smoother plot and reveals a longer-term trend ofForce Index.\nHow Long a Moving Average? Moving averages help identify trends. A\nrising MA encourages you to maintain longs, whereas a falling MA tellsyou to hold shorts. The wider the time window, the smoother is a movingaverage. That benefit has a cost. The longer a moving average, the slowerit responds to trend changes. The shorter a moving average, the better ittracks prices, but the more subject it is to whipsaws, temporary deviationsfrom the main trend. If you make your moving average very long, it willmiss important reversals by a wide margin. Shorter MAs are more sensitiveMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 89\nto trend changes, but those shorter than 10 bars defeat the purpose of a\ntrend-following tool.\nAt the time I wrote Trading for a Living , I was using 13-bar MAs, but in\nrecent years I switched to longer moving averages to catch more importanttrends and avoid whipsaws. To analyze weekly charts, start with a 26-weekmoving average, representing half a year’s worth of data. Try to shorten thatnumber and see whether you can do it without sacrificing the smoothnessof your MA. On the daily charts, start with a 22-day MA, reflecting roughlythe number of trading days in a month, and see whether you can make itshorter. Whatever length you decide to use, be sure to test it on your owndata. If you track just a handful of markets, you’ll have enough time to trydifferent lengths of moving averages until you get smoothly flowing lines.\nThe width of any indicator time window is best expressed in bars rather\nthan days. The computer doesn’t know whether you are analyzing daily,monthly, or hourly charts; it sees only bars. Whatever we say about a dailyMA applies to the weekly or the monthly. It’s better to call it a 22-bar MArather than a 22-day MA.\nMathematically savvy traders can look into using adaptive moving aver-\nages whose length changes in response to market conditions, as advo-cated by John Ehlers, Tushar Chande, and Perry Kaufman. Ehlers’ latestbook, Rocket Science for Traders, delves into adapting all indicators to cur-\nrent market conditions.\nWhat Type of Moving Average? A simple MA adds up prices in its time\nwindow and divides the sum by the width of that window. For example, fora 10-day simple MA of closing prices, add up closing prices for the past 10days and divide the sum by 10. The trouble with a simple MA is that eachprice affects it twice—when it comes in and when it drops out. A high newvalue pushes up the moving average, giving a buy signal. This is good; wewant our MAs to respond to new prices. The trouble is that 10 days later,when that high number drops from the window, the MA also drops, givinga sell signal. This is ridiculous because if we shorten a simple MA by oneday, we’ll get that sell signal a day sooner, and if we lengthen it by a day,we’ll get it a day later. We can engineer our own signals by fiddling with thelength of a simple MA!\nAn exponential moving average (EMA) overcomes this problem. It re-\nacts only to incoming prices, to which it assigns more weight. It does notdrop old prices from its time window, but slowly squeezes them out withthe passage of time.90 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nEMA =Ptoday•K+EMAyesterday•(1− K)\nN =the number of days in the EMA (selected by trader)\nPtoday=today’s price\nEMAyesterday =the EMA of yesterday\nFew people calculate indicators by hand these days—computers do it\nfaster and more accurately. If we decide to look at a 22-bar EMA of clos-ing prices, K =2/(22+ 1)=2/23 =0.087. Multiply the latest closing price by\nthat figure, multiply yesterday’s EMA by 0.913 (i.e., 1 − 0.087 ), add the two,\nand arrive at today’s EMA. Traders sometimes ask where to get an EMA inthe beginning. Begin by calculating a 22-bar simple MA and then switch tothe EMA. Most indicators require you to have one or two months of databefore they start giving meaningful signals.\nTrading Signals The most important message of a moving average is the\ndirection of its slope. When the EMA rises, it shows that the crowd is be-coming more optimistic and bullish, which is a good time to be long. Whenit falls, it shows that the crowd is becoming more pessimistic and bearish. Itis a good time to be short.\nWhen a moving average points up, trade that market from the long side.\nWhen a moving average points down, trade that market from the short side. As\na trader, you have three options: go long, go short, or stand aside. A movingaverage takes away one of those. When it points up, it prohibits you fromshorting and tells you to go long or stand aside. When it points down, it pro-hibits you from buying and tells you to look only for shorts or stay out. Whenan EMA starts jerking up and down, it indicates a vacillating, trendless mar-ket; it is better to stop using trend-following methods. Continue to monitorthe EMA, but take its signals at a discount until a new trend emerges.\nThe only time when it is OK to override the message of a moving aver-\nage is when trying to pick a bottom after a bullish divergence betweenMACD-Histogram (described below) and price. If you do that, be sure touse tight stops. If you succeed, bank your profits but do not think that therules of the game have changed. A trader who thinks he is above the rulesbecomes careless and loses money.\nEnter long positions in the vicinity of a rising MA. Enter short positions in\nthe vicinity of a falling MA. Use MA to differentiate between “value trades” andwhereN K =+2\n1METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 91\n92 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nFigure 5.5 Moving Average—Major Trend\nAn exponential moving average is slow but steady, like a directional\nindicator on a steamroller. EMA works in all timeframes but shines on\nthe weeklies, where it helps you stay with the major trend no matter\nhow hard it tries to shake you off. Trading in the direction of a weeklymoving average should help you get ahead of many traders. You can posi-\ntion yourself in the direction of the EMA and hold, or else trade in and out,\nusing daily charts.\nThis 26-week EMA has tracked the entire glorious bull market in YHOO,\nfrom its obscure beginnings, to the breathtaking $250 peak, and back into the\ndoghouse. If you wake up in the morning, look at the weekly EMA, and trade\nin its direction, you will not be in too bad a shape!\nThere are no perfect indicators, and an EMA has its share of diffi-\nculties when markets go flat. When the EMA starts to quiver, as it did in\n1999, it is time to stand aside or trade short term, not counting on a\nmajor trend.\nNotice the three tails in YHOO (and the fourth, not as pure as the first\nthree). Every time there was a tail, the price got halved within weeks.\nAt the right edge of the chart prices are flat and EMA is declining. Prices\nare closer to the bottom than they are to the top, but there is no rush\nto buy. Let the EMA flatten out and tick up before positioning for a new\nmajor bull move.\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 93\n“greater fool theory trades.” Most uptrends are punctuated by declines, when\nprices return to the EMA. When we buy near the moving average, we buyvalue and can place a tight stop slightly below the EMA. If the rally resumes,we’ll make money, but if the market turns against us, the loss will be small.Buying near the EMA helps maximize gains and minimize risks.\nFigure 5.6 Value Trades and Greater Fool Theory Trades\nWhen you buy near a rising moving average, you buy value (points D and F).\nWaiting for such opportunities requires patience, but it is infinitely safer thanchasing rallies. Those who buy high above the EMA pay above value, hoping\nto meet a greater fool who will pay them even more. Anxious traders who\nbuy near the tops (points C and E) get shaken out, or else they tensely waitto get out at breakeven.\nMany stocks and futures have typical behavior patterns, and you should\ntry to identify them and use them. At the time of this writing, EBAY likes to\nhave kangaroo tails (A, B, C, and E). The C tail had the most classical shape,\nbut others worked also. Knowing what pattern to expect helps you recognize\nit a little sooner when it appears.\nAt the right edge of the chart the EMA has stopped rising and begun to flut-\nter. The bull move is over. If you are a trend trader, it is time to move over to\nother, trending stocks. Keep an eye on EBAY, waiting for a new trend to emerge.\nA\nBCE\nF\nD\nValueValue\nIf we buy high above the EMA, our actions say, “I am a fool, I am over-\npaying, but I hope to meet a greater fool down the road who’ll pay meeven more.” Betting on the greater fool theory is a poor idea. There arevery few fools in the markets. Financial markets do not attract foolish peo-ple, and counting on them is a losing proposition.\nThere are times when wild rallies in high-flying stocks seem to vindi-\ncate the greater fool theory. Stocks with no assets or earnings can fly onhot air. A value trader who feels he is missing those spectacular moveshas a choice. He can stick to his method, soberly saying, “Can’t catchthem all.” Or he may decide, “When living with the wolves, howl like awolf” and start buying upside breakouts. If you do that, remember, youare now engaged in greater fool theory trading and the only asset sepa-rating you from the manic crowd is your risk control—your stops andmoney management.\nThe same rules apply to shorting in downtrends. When you go short on\na rally to the EMA, you are selling value—before the market reverses andstarts destroying value again. A greater fool theorist shorts far below theEMA—the farther away, the greater the fool.\nUse a system of dual moving averages to identify trends and enter posi-\ntions. You may select an EMA that tracks your market well, but it moves\nso explosively that prices never react back to that EMA, denying you achance to put on a value trade. To solve this problem, you can add a sec-ond moving average. Use the longer EMA to indicate the trend, and theshorter to find entry points.\nSuppose you find that a 22-day EMA does a good job identifying trends\nin your market. Plot it, but then divide its length in half and plot an 11-dayEMA on the same screen in a different color. Continue to use the 22-day EMAto identify bull and bear moves, but use pullbacks to the shorter EMA toidentify entry points.\nMoving averages help identify trends and decide whether to trade long\nor short. They help mark value areas for entering trades. To find exit points,we turn to our next tool, channels on moving averages.\nChannels\nMarkets are manic-depressive beasts. They rise in powerful rallies, onlyto collapse in breathtaking declines. A stock catches the public’s fancy,shoots up 20 points one day, and then slides 24 points down the next.What drives those moves? Fundamental values change slowly, but wavesof greed, fear, optimism, and despair drive prices up and down.94 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nHow can you tell when a market has reached an undervalued or over-\nvalued level, a zone for buying or selling? Market technicians can usechannels to find those levels. A channel, or an envelope, consists of twolines, one above and one below a moving average. There are two maintypes of channels: straight envelopes and standard deviation channels,also known as Bollinger bands.\nIn Bollinger bands the spread between the upper and lower lines keeps\nchanging in response to volatility. When volatility rises, Bollinger bandsspread wide, but when markets become sleepy, those bands start squeez-ing the moving average. This feature makes them useful for options traderssince volatility drives options prices. In a nutshell, when Bollinger bandsbecome narrow, volatility is low, and options should be bought. When theyswing far apart, volatility is high, and options should be sold or written.\nTraders of stocks and futures are better off with straight channels or\nenvelopes. They keep a steady distance from a moving average, provid-ing steadier price targets. Draw both lines a certain percentage above orbelow the EMA. If you use dual moving averages, draw channel lines par-allel to the longer one.\nA moving average reflects the average consensus of value, but what is\nthe meaning of a channel? \nThe upper channel line reflects the power of\nbulls to push prices above the average consensus of value. It marks thenormal limit of market optimism. The lower channel line reflects the powerof bears to push prices below the average consensus of value. It marks thenormal limit of market pessimism. A well-drawn channel helps diagnosemania and depression. \nMost software programs draw channels according\nto this formula:\nUpper channel line =EMA +EMA •Channel coefficient\nLower channel line =EMA − EMA •Channel coefficient\nA well-drawn channel contains the bulk of prices, with only a few\nextremes poking out. Adjust the coefficient until the channel containsapproximately 95 percent of all prices for the past several months. Mathe-maticians call this the second standard deviation channel . Most software\npackages make this adjustment very easy.\nFind proper channel coefficients for any market by trial and error. Keep\nadjusting them until the channel holds approximately 95% of all data, withonly the highest tops and the lowest bottoms sticking out. Drawing a chan-nel is like trying on a shirt. Choose the size in which the entire body fits com-fortably, with only the wrists and the neck poking out.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 95\nDifferent trading vehicles and timeframes require different channel\nwidths. Volatile markets require wider channels and higher coefficients.The longer the timeframe, the wider the channel; weekly channels tend tobe twice as wide as dailies. Stocks tend to require wider channels thanfutures. A good time to review and adjust channels in futures is when anold contract nears expiration and you switch to the new front month.\nA channel drawn in an uptrend tends to fit the peaks. Rallies in a bull\nmarket are much stronger than declines, and bottoms seldom reach thelower channel line. In a downtrend, a channel tends to track bottoms,while the tops are too limp to rise to the upper channel line. It is unnec-essary to draw two separate channels, one for the tops and the other forthe bottoms; just follow the dominant crowd. In a flat market expect bothtops and bottoms to touch their channel lines.\nWhen we are bullish, we want to buy value near the rising EMA and take\nprofits when the market becomes overvalued—at or above the upper chan-nel line. When bearish, we want to go short near the falling EMA and coverwhen the market becomes undervalued—at or below the lower channel line.96 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nBEGIK\nJ\nH\nF\nDC\nA\nFigure 5.7 Channels for Profit Taking\nWhen the EMA rises, it identifies an uptrend. It is a good idea to buy near that\nEMA or slightly higher or lower, depending on the stock’s recent behavior.At point A, EMA stands at 35, while the low point of the bar reaches 33—a\nIf you buy near a rising moving average, take profits in the vicinity of\nthe upper channel line. If you sell short near a falling moving average,cover in the vicinity of the lower channel line. Channels catch swings\nabove and below value but not major trends. Those swings can be veryrewarding. If you can catch a move from the EMA to the channel line inbond futures, you’ll make about $2,000 in profit on a $2,000 margin. Ifyou can do this a few times a year, you’ll find yourself far ahead of manyprofessionals.\nA beginner who sells his position near the upper channel line may\nregret it several weeks later. In a bull market, what looks overvalued todaymay look like a bargain the next month. Professionals do not let such feel-ings bother them. They are trading, not investing. They know it’s easy tobe smart looking at old charts, but hard to make decisions at the rightedge. They have a system, and they follow it.\nWhen prices blow out of a channel but then return to the moving aver-\nage, trade in the direction of the slope of that MA, with a profit target nearthe channel line. Prices break out of channels only during the strongest\ntrends. After they pull back, they often retest the extremes of those break-METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 97\n2-point downside penetration. At point C, the price low penetrates the EMA\nby 1 point, at D by 2.25, at F by 4, at point H by 0.75, and at J by 4. Those\nshort-term bottoms keep alternating between shallow and deep—an impor-\ntant piece of intelligence when you try to decide where to place your buy\norder. If the latest penetration was shallow, expect the next one to be deep,and vice versa, and place your buy orders accordingly.\nThe place to sell stocks purchased near the EMA is at the upper channel\nline. Looking back, it is easy to see that buy-and-hold would have workedeven better in TARO, but the future is not nearly as clear at the right edge ofthe chart. Buying value near the EMA and taking profits above value, near theupper channel line, is safer and more reliable. Stock bought at A can be soldat B, bought again at C or D and sold at E, and so on.\nA trader can grade his performance, based on the percentage of the chan-\nnel he takes in profits on any given trade. For example, at the right edge ofthe chart, the upper channel line stands at 97 and the lower at 69, makingthe channel 28 points high. An A trader should get the minimum of 30% or8.4 points out of the next trade, a B trader 20% or 5.6 points, and a C trader\n10% or 2.8 points.\nAt the right edge of the chart, prices are hitting the upper channel line. It\nis time to take profits on stocks purchased in area J, near the EMA, and waitfor a pullback.\nouts. A breakout from a channel gives us confidence to trade again in its\ndirection.\nPrices occasionally take off on wild runaway trends. They break out of a\nchannel and stay out for a long time, without pulling back to their EMA.When you recognize such a powerful move, you have a choice: stand asideor switch to a system for trading impulse moves. Professional traders, oncethey find a technique that works for them, tend to stay with it. They’d rathermiss a trade than change to an unfamiliar style.\nIf a moving average is essentially flat, go long at the lower channel line,\nsell short at the upper channel line, and take profits when prices return totheir moving average. The upper channel line marks an overbought zone.\nIf the market is relatively flat on long-term charts, rallies to the upperchannel line then provide shorting opportunities, whereas declines tothe lower channel line provide buying opportunities. Professionals tendto trade against deviations and for the return to normalcy. Amateurs thinkthat every breakout will be followed by a massive runaway move. Oncein a rare while the amateurs are right, but in the long run it pays to betlike the pros. They use channels to find when the market has outrun itselfand where it is likely to reverse.\nHow to Grade Your Performance Imagine two friends taking a college\ncourse. Both have similar abilities and backgrounds, but one takes a testeach week, while the other waits for a final. All other factors being equal,which of them is likely to get a higher grade on the exam? The one whowaited or the one who took weekly tests?\nMost educational systems test students at regular intervals. Testing\nprompts people to fill the gaps in their knowledge. Students who taketests throughout the year tend to do better on their finals. Frequent testshelp improve performance.\nMarkets keep testing us, only most traders don’t bother to look up their\ngrades. They gloat over profits or trash confirmation slips for losing trades.Neither bragging nor beating yourself makes you a better trader.\nThe market grades every trade and posts results on a wall, only most\ntraders have no clue where to look. Some count money, but that’s a verycrude measure, which does not compare performance in different marketsat different prices. You may take more money from a sloppy trade in a bigexpensive market than from an elegant entry and exit in a difficult narrowmarket. Which of them reveals a higher level of skill? Money is importantbut it doesn’t always provide the best measure of success.98 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 99\nChannels help us grade the quality of our trades.\nWhen you enter a trade, measure the height of the channel from the\nupper to the lower line. If you use daily charts to find trades, measure thedaily channel; if you use a 10-minute chart, measure the channel on a 10-minute chart; and so on. When you exit that trade, calculate the numberof points you’ve taken as a percentage of the channel. That is your per-formance grade.\nIf a stock is trading at 80 with a 10% channel, then the upper channel line\nis at 88 and the lower at 72. Suppose you buy that stock at 80 and sell it at84. If you take 4 points out of the 16-point channel, then your grade is \n4⁄16\nor 25%. Where does that place you on the rating curve?\nAny trade where you take 30% or more out of a channel earns you an\nA. If you take between 20 and 30%, your grade is a solid B. If you grabbetween 10 and 20%, you earn a C. You get a D by taking less than 10%out of a channel or running a loss.\nGood traders keep good records. Your first essential record is a spread-\nsheet of all your trades (we’ll review this in Chapter 8, “The OrganizedTrader”). Add two columns to your spreadsheet. Use the first to record theheight of the channel when you enter the trade. Use the second to calculatewhat percentage of that channel you’ve grabbed exiting that trade. Keep mon-itoring your grades to see whether your performance is improving or deteri-orating, steady or erratic. Back in college, professors used to grade you. Nowyou can use channels to find out your grades and become a better trader.\nWhat Markets to Trade? Channels can help us decide which stocks or\nfutures to trade and which to leave alone. A stock may have great funda-mentals or beautiful technical signals, but measure its channel before youput on a trade. It’ll show you whether the swings are wide enough to beworth trading.\nYou may look at a volatile stock whose channel height is 30 points. If\nyou are an A trader, you should be able to get 30%, or 9 points, out of atrade. That will be more than enough to pay commissions, cover slippage,and leave you with profits. On the other hand, if you look at an inexpen-sive stock whose channel is only 5 points high, then an A trader would beshooting for a paltry 1.5-point gain. That would leave you with next tonothing after commissions and slippage—leave that stock alone, no mat-ter how good it looks.\nWhat if your performance slips a bit or the market throws you a curve?\nWhat if you earn only a C and take only 10% out of a channel? The first\nstock, with its 30-point channel, will return 3 points profit—enough to make\nsome money after expenses. The stock with a 5-point channel will returnonly half a point, and commissions and slippage may push you into nega-tive territory! Beginners are often seduced by low-priced stocks with strongtechnical patterns. They cannot understand why they keep losing money.When there is no room for the stock to swing, a trader can’t win.\nA good technical analyst who was slowly losing money called me for\na consultation. When I asked him to fax me his charts, he showed $10and $15 stocks whose channels were only $2 to $4 tall. There was simplyno room for price swings, while commissions, slippage, and expensescontinued to chip away at his equity. If you’re going to support yourselfby fishing, find a channel where the fish are big enough.\nOnce you become interested in a new stock, draw a channel to see\nwhether it’s wide enough to trade. We like to think of ourselves as A tradersand all-around A people, but what if you pull only a C trade? If you takeonly 10 percent out of this channel, will it be worth trading? Beginningtraders should leave alone any stock whose channel is narrower than 10points, meaning that a C trader can take one point out of it.\nA few traders said to me it was OK to trade stocks with narrrow chan-\nnels, as long as one increased trading size. They think that trading 10,000shares in a three-point channel is the same as trading 1,000 shares in a30-point channel, but it is not, because the ratio of slippage to channel ismuch higher in narrow channels, raising the external barrier to victory.\nLow-priced stocks with slender channels can make good investments.\nThink of Peter Lynch, a famous money manager, looking for his elusive10-bagger, a stock that goes up 10-fold. A $5 stock is much more likely torise to $50 than an $80 stock to rally to $800. But those are investments,not trades. As a trader, you are looking to take advantage of short-termswings. That is why you should not waste your energy on any stock whosechannel is narrow.\nThe Rewards of Day-Trading Day-trading seems deceptively easy, and\nbeginners flock to it like moths to a flame. Amateurs look at intraday chartsand see strong rallies and steep declines. It looks like the money is therefor the picking by any sharp-witted individual with a computer, a modem,and a live data feed. Day-trading firms make fortunes in commissions. Theypromote day-trading because they need to replace the great majority of cus-tomers who flame out. The firms hide customer statistics from the public,but in the year 2000 state regulators in Massachusetts subpoenaed recordswhich showed that after 6 months only 16% of day-traders made money.100 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThere is an old Russian saying: “your elbow is near, yet you can’t bite\nit.” Try it now—stretch your neck, bend your arm, go for it. So near, yetso far. It’s the same with day-trading—the money is right in front of yourface, yet you keep missing it by a few ticks. Why do so many people loseso much money day-trading? There is simply not enough height in intra-day channels to make profits. Using channels to select trades sends apowerful message to day-traders.\nLook at a few popular actively traded stocks—YHOO, AMZN, and AOL\nare in the forefront of public attention on the day I write this. The figures arelikely to change by the time you read this book, but today I get the follow-ing numbers for channel heights on their daily and five-minute charts:\nA-level C-level Five- A-level C-level\nDaily trader trader minute trader trader\nchannel (30%) (10%) channel (30%) (10%)\nAOL 20 6 2 3 0.9 0.3\nAMZN 21 6.3 2.1 3 0.9 0.3\nYHOO 54 16.2 5.4 7 2.1 0.7\nA swing trader who uses daily charts to buy and hold for a few days can do\nvery well in these active stocks. He can really clean up if he is an A-leveltrader, but even if he is a C trader, taking 10% out of a channel, he can stayafloat while he’s learning. A person who day-trades the same stocks mustbe a straight-A trader in order to survive. Anything less, and he’ll be eatenalive by slippage, commissions, and expenses.\nI can hear a howl of protests from the crowd of vendors who make a\ngood living from day-trading—brokers, software dealers, system sellers,etc. They can roll out their examples of successful day-traders, as if thatproves anything! Brilliant day-traders do exist, and I am friends with ahandful of them myself. Sadly, it’s a very small handful.\nThe chances of becoming a successful day-trader are very low because\nthe channels on intraday charts are not high enough. You must be astraight-A trader to make money out of those minute swings. The slightestdistraction, a bit of market noise, a slight slip of performance, and anotherday-trader bites the dust.\nDay-trading provides fantastic entertainment value. Recreational ath-\nletes expect to pay for their sport rather than make money from it.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 101\nRecreational day-traders who expect to make money are deluding them-\nselves into believing that they will reach their elbow with their teeth.Maybe tomorrow ....\nMACD-Histogram\nMACD stands for Moving Average Convergence-Divergence. This indicator\nwas developed by Gerald Appel, who combined three moving averagesinto two MACD lines. We can enhance MACD by plotting it as a histogram,reflecting the distance between those lines. It helps identify trends and ratethe power of bulls and bears. It is one of the best tools in technical analy-sis for catching reversals.\nBefore we use any indicator, we must understand how it is constructed\nand what it measures. As noted before, each price represents a momen-tary consensus of value of market participants. A moving average showsus the average consensus of value during a selected period of time. A fastmoving average reflects the average consensus during a short period oftime, and a slow moving average during a longer period of time. MACD-Histogram measures changes in consensus by tracking the spread betweenfast and slow moving averages.\nAppel used three exponential moving averages to create MACD:\n1.Calculate a 12-day EMA of closing prices.\n2.Calculate a 26-day EMA of closing prices.\n3.Subtract the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA—this is the fast or\nMACD line.\n4.Calculate a 9-day EMA of the fast line—this is the slow or signal line.\nThe values of 12, 26, and 9 have become standard numbers, used as de-\nfaults in most software packages. My testing shows that changing thesevalues has little impact on MACD signals, unless you go way out on a limband seriously distort their relationships by more than doubling one but notthe others. If you track several markets and do not have the time to cus-tomize your indicators, you can accept the default values of MACD. If youfollow only a few markets, it makes sense to experiment with higher andlower MACD values to find those that more closely track turning points inyour stocks or futures. If your software doesn’t include MACD, you mayuse two EMAs (for example, 12-day and 26-day) in lieu of the fast andslow MACD lines. Then apply the MACD-Histogram formula, on the nextpage, to the spread between those two averages.102 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThe fast line of MACD reflects a short-term consensus of value, while the\nslow signal line reflects a longer-term consensus. When the fast line risesabove the slow line, it shows that market participants are becoming morebullish. When bulls are becoming stronger, it is a good time to get long.When the fast line of MACD falls below the slow line, it shows that marketparticipants are becoming bearish. When bears become stronger, it is a goodMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 103\nFigure 5.8 MACD Lines\nEntry and exit signals are rarely symmetrical. The indicator that gives you\ngood entry signals is usually not the best indicator for exits; some other toolwill do a better job. MACD lines give entry signals when the fast line crossesthe slow line. If the fast line crosses above, it gives a signal to go long. When\nit crosses below, it gives a signal to sell short. Waiting for a crossover in the\nopposite direction to close out a position is not a good idea because by thattime a lion’s share of profits will have evaporated.\nCan you find a trading system in this chart? MACD lines tell you to enter\nat the crossover, but how will you decide when to exit? What tools can you\nuse to find out when a market surge is starting to fade and hop off with profit?\nAt the right edge of the chart MACD lines are in a buy mode, with a fast\nline above the slow and both rising. Prices are hovering above the EMA—anovervalued level. Buying at the right edge would mean taking a “greater fool\ntheory” trade. Placing a buy order in the vicinity of the rising EMA would\nallow us to buy value.\nbuy buybuy buysell sell sell\ntime to get short. MACD lines follow trends, and their crossovers mark trend\nreversals. Like all trend-following indicators, they work best when marketsare moving but lead to whipsaws during choppy periods. We can makeMACD more useful by converting it into MACD-Histogram.\nMACD-Histogram =Fast MACD line −Slow signal line\nMACD-Histogram measures the spread between short-term and long-\nterm moving averages and plots it as a histogram. It reflects the differencebetween short-term and long-term consensus of value. Some softwarepackages include MACD lines but not MACD-Histogram. In that case, runMACD lines, return to the menu and run an indicator called spread (or\nsimilar), which should measure the spread between the two lines and plotit as a histogram.\nWhen you look at MACD lines, their spread may appear tiny, but MACD-\nHistogram rescales it to fit the screen. The slope of MACD-Histogram showswhether bulls or bears are growing stronger. That slope is defined by the104 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nB\nAC\nFigure 5.9 MACD-Histogram\nA very powerful signal of MACD-Histogram, which occurs only once or\ntwice per year on a daily chart, is a divergence between the indicator peaksor bottoms and price extremes. In area A the Euro grinds down to a low ofTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nrelationship between the two latest bars. When the bars of MACD-Histogram\nrise (like the pattern of letters g-G), they show that the crowd is becomingbullish—it is a good time to be long. When the slope of MACD-Histogramdeclines (like in letters Q-q), it shows that the crowd is becoming bearish—it is a good time to be short.\nMarkets run on a two-party system—the bulls and the bears. When\nMACD-Histogram rises, it shows that bulls are becoming stronger, and whenit declines, it shows that bears are becoming stronger. MACD-Histogramhelps you bet on the winning party and sell short the opposition.\nThe Strongest Signal MACD-Histogram gives two types of signals. One\nis ordinary, and we see it at every bar—it is the slope of MACD-Histogram. An uptick of MACD-Histogram shows that bulls are strongerthan they were at the previous bar, and a downtick shows that bears aregaining. Those upticks and downticks provide minor buy and sell signals,but we shouldn’t read too much into them. Markets do not move inMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 105\n84 cents and MACD-Histogram confirms that low by tracing its own bottom,\nA. Prices rally into area B, and a strong rally of MACD-Histogram confirms\nits strength. It rises to a new multi-month high, showing that bulls are becom-\ning stronger below the surface of the bear market. Prices trace a double top\nin area B. The second top of MACD-Histogram in that area is a little lowerthan the first, warning of the imminent resumption of the downtrend. So far,\nthe indicator and prices are in gear, but from this point they diverge.\nIn area C prices crash to a new bear market low, while MACD-Histogram\nstops just below its centerline, creating a more shallow bottom than during itsprevious decline. When it ticks up from that low, it completes the bullish di-vergence and shows that bears have run out of steam and bulls are taking over.\nWhen two or three diverse technical tools flash the same message, they\nconfirm one another. Notice that prices have traced a false downside break-\nout in area C. That breakout has cleaned out stops placed by bulls and suckedin the most rabid bears who shorted. Premature bulls have been shaken out,late bears have been trapped, and the upside reversal is complete. Thosetrapped bears will have to cover shorts when they can no longer stand the\npain, adding fuel to the rally.\nAt the right edge of the chart prices are shooting higher from a bullish\ndivergence. This powerful pattern usually propels prices for weeks if notmonths.\nstraight lines, and it’s normal for MACD-Histogram to keep ticking up\nand down.\nThe other signal occurs rarely, only a couple of times per year on the\ndaily charts of most markets, but it’s worth waiting for because it is thestrongest signal in technical analysis. That signal is a divergence betweenthe peaks and bottoms of price and MACD-Histogram. A divergence occurswhen the trend of price highs and lows goes one way and the trend of topsand bottoms in MACD-Histogram goes the opposite way. Those patterns takeseveral weeks or even more than a month to develop on the daily charts. \nA bullish divergence occurs when prices trace a bottom, rally, and then\nsink to a new low. At the same time MACD-Histogram traces a differentpattern. When it rallies from its first bottom, that rally lifts it above thezero line, “breaking the back of the bear.” When prices sink to a new low,MACD-Histogram declines to a more shallow bottom. At that point,prices are lower, but the bottom of MACD-Histogram is higher, showingthat bears are weaker and the downtrend is ready for a reversal. MACD-Histogram gives a buy signal when it ticks up from its second bottom.\nOccasionally, the second bottom is followed by a third. This is why\ntraders must use stops and proper money management. There are no cer-tainties in the markets, only probabilities. Even a reliable pattern such asa divergence of MACD-Histogram fails occasionally, which is why we mustexit if prices fall below their second bottom. We must preserve our trad-ing capital and reenter when MACD-Histogram ticks up from its third bot-tom, as long as it is higher than the first.\nA bearish divergence occurs when prices rise to a new high, decline,\nand then rise to a higher peak. MACD-Histogram gives the first sign oftrouble when it breaks below its zero line during the decline from its firstpeak. When prices reach a higher high, MACD-Histogram rises to a muchlower high. It shows that bulls are weaker, and prices are rising simply outof inertia and are ready to reverse.\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles MACD-Histogram offers traders what\nx-rays offer doctors, showing the strength or weakness of the bone belowthe surface of the skin. Bulls or bears may appear powerful when pricesreach a new extreme, but a divergence of MACD-Histogram shows that thedominant party is becoming weak and prices are ready to reverse.\nGo long when MACD-Histogram traces a bullish divergence, that is,\nwhen prices fall to a new low while the indicator ticks up from a more shal-low low. Get long after MACD-Histogram ticks up from its second bottom.106 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nA bottom that is more shallow than the preceding one shows that bears\nhave grown weaker, and the uptick tells us that bulls are taking over. Placea protective stop below the latest bottom. Rallies from bullish divergencestend to be very powerful, but you must always use protection in case asignal does not work out.\nAn aggressive trader can make that stop “stop-and reverse,” meaning\nthat if stopped out of a long position, he will reverse and go short. Whena super-strong signal doesn’t pan out, it shows that something is funda-mentally changing below the surface of the market. If you buy on thestrongest signal in technical analysis and then your stop gets hit, it meansthat bears are especially strong, making it worthwhile to sell short.Reversing positions from long to short is usually not the best idea, but thefailure of a divergence of MACD-Histogram is an exception.\nI call this a Hound of the Baskervilles signal, after a story by Sir Arthur\nConan Doyle. Sherlock Holmes was called to investigate a murder on acountry estate. His clue came from the fact that the family dog did not barkwhile the crime was being committed. That indicated the dog knew thecriminal, and the murder was an inside job. Sherlock Holmes receivedhis signal not from the action but from the lack of expected action. Whena divergence of MACD-Histogram fails to produce a reversal, it gives aHound of the Baskervilles signal.\nGo short when the MACD-Histogram traces a bearish divergence, that is,\nwhen prices rise to a new high but the indicator ticks down from a lowerpeak. When the crowd gets on its hind legs and roars, it is tempting to\nthrow caution to the wind, close our eyes, and buy. When the crowd be-comes manic, it is hard to remain cool, but an intelligent trader looks forMACD-Histogram divergences. If prices rally, decline, and then rally to ahigher level, but MACD-Histogram rallies, falls below its zero line, break-ing the back of the bull, and rallies again, but to a lower level, it createsa bearish divergence. It shows that bulls have grown weaker, the stock isrising out of inertia, and as soon as that inertia runs out, the stock is likelyto collapse.\nMACD-Histogram flashes a signal to go short when it ticks down from\nits second peak. Once short, place a stop above the latest rally peak.Placing stops when shorting near the tops is notoriously difficult becauseof high volatility. Trading smaller positions allows you to place wider stops.\nDivergences between MACD-Histogram and prices on the daily charts\nare almost always worth trading. Divergences on the weekly charts usu-ally mark transitions between bull and bear markets.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 107\nWhen MACD-Histogram reaches a new multi-month peak, it indicates\nthat bulls are extremely strong, and the corresponding price peak is likelyto be retested or exceeded. When MACD-Histogram falls to a new multi-month low, it shows that bears are extremely strong, and the correspondingprice low is likely to be retested or exceeded.\nWhen MACD-Histogram rises to a new record peak, it shows a terrific\nsplash of bullish enthusiasm. Even if bulls pause to catch their breath, theupside inertia is so strong that the rally is likely to resume after a pause.When MACD-Histogram drops to a new low, it shows that bears are ex-tremely strong. Even if bulls manage to stage a rally, the sheer downsideinertia is likely to drive the market to retest or exceed its low.\nMACD-Histogram works like headlights on a car—it lights up a stretch\nof the road ahead. It doesn’t show you the entire way home, but lets yousee far enough so that driving at a normal speed you can prepare for thetwists and turns ahead.108 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nA\nC\nBD\nE\nFigure 5.10 The Hound of the Baskervilles Signal\nHeating oil, along with the rest of the oil complex, ran up to an historic high\nin November 2000. Then the demand shrunk, new supplies entered the mar-\nket, bullish mania was broken, and oil began to slide. In December, it fell to85 cents (point A), with MACD-Histogram tracing a new massive low, which\nForce Index\nForce Index is an oscillator developed by this author and first described\ninTrading for a Living . The decision to reveal Force Index was one of the\nhardest in writing that book. I felt reluctant to disclose my private weaponbut remembered how resentful I used to feel while reading books byauthors who wrote, in so many words, “Now, of course, you wouldn’texpect me to tell you everything,” I decided I would write either every-thing or nothing, and describe Force Index.\nThe disclosure did me no harm. Force Index continues to work for me\nas well as it did before. Very few software companies have included it intheir systems, and its behavior on my charts hasn’t changed. This remindsme of a good friend with whom I served on a ship. He was the biggestsmuggler I ever met, but he never hid anything far away. Sometimes he’dput the contraband right on his desk, under the noses of customs officers.\nLeaving a secret in the open can be the best way of hiding it.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 109\nindicated that bears were extremely strong. There was a brief reflex rally to\nthe EMA, while the indicator turned positive (breaking the back of the bear)\nand then declined to a more shallow low (point B). At that time prices tracedout a kangaroo tail, reaching down to 75 cents, and turned up. That bullishdivergence, combined with a tail, gave a buy signal. Remember, no matter\nhow strong the signal, a serious trader needs to use stops.\nHeating oil resumed its decline and gave a Hound of the Baskervilles\nsell signal when prices violated their bottom B in area C. It paid to switch\nto the short side then because heating oil eventually slid below 68. A vio-lation of a bullish divergence of MACD-Histogram is a prime example of\nthe Hound of the Baskervilles signal. The underlying fundamentals must be\nextremely strong to violate a divergence, and one is well advised to trade\nin the direction of the break after the stop is hit.\nIf you have the discipline to use stops and reverse after a divergence is vio-\nlated, you are not going to be afraid the next time you see a divergence. After\nseeing a new bullish divergence D-E you’ll put on a trade again, using the\nsame principles and rules.\nAt the right edge of the chart a minor bullish divergence is taking shape.\nPrices have briefly violated their March-April lows and rallied, completing a\nfalse downside breakout and giving a bullish signal. The EMA has stoppeddeclining and gone flat. From here, heating oil should be traded from the\nlong side, with a stop below the recent low.\nForce Index helps identify turning points in any market by tying together\nthree essential pieces of information—the direction of price movement, itsextent, and volume. Price represents the consensus of value among marketparticipants. Volume reflects their level of commitment, financial as well asemotional. Price reflects what people think, and volume what they feel.Force Index links mass opinion with mass emotion by asking three ques-tions: Is the price going up or down? How big is the change? How muchvolume did it take to move the price?\nIt is very useful to measure the force of a move because strong moves\nare more likely to continue than weak ones. Divergences between peaksand bottoms of prices and Force Index help nail important turning points.Spikes of Force Index identify zones of mass hysteria, where trendsbecome exhausted. Here is the Force Index formula:\nForce Index =(Close\ntoday−Closeyesterday )•Volumetoday\nIf the market closes higher today than yesterday, Force Index is positive,\nand if it closes lower, Force Index is negative. The greater the spreadbetween today’s and yesterday’s closes, the greater the force. The higherthe volume, the more forceful the move.\nForce Index is greater when the market moves far on high volume and\nlesser when the market moves a short distance on thin volume. When themarket closes unchanged, Force Index equals zero.\nSmooth Is Better We can plot Force Index as a histogram, with positive\nreadings above the zero line and negative readings below. The raw ForceIndex looks very jagged, up one day, down the next. It works better if wesmooth it with an exponential moving average and plot it as a line.\nIf we smooth Force Index with a long-term EMA of 13 days or longer, it\nwill measure long-term shifts in the balance of power between bulls andbears. To help pinpoint entries and exits, we should smooth Force Indexwith a very short moving average, such as a two-day EMA.\nWhen the trend of our stock or future is up and the two-day EMA of\nForce Index declines below zero, it gives a buy signal. When the trend isdown and the two-day EMA of Force Index rallies above zero, it gives asell signal. \nThe key to using a short-term Force Index is to combine it with a trend-\nfollowing indicator. For example, when the 22-day EMA of price is up andthe two-day EMA of Force Index becomes negative, it reveals a short-termsplash of bearishness within an uptrend, a buying opportunity. Once long,110 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 111\nFigure 5.11 Force Index—Two-Day EMA\nSpikes of a short-term, two-bar Force Index mark areas where trends exhaust\nthemselves. The downward spike in area A showed that the move from 56 to43 was at its end. Curiously enough, it was immediately followed by an\nupward spike in area B. This pattern of two adjacent spikes, pointing inopposite directions, shows a great deal of confusion in the markets and isusually followed by a period of flat prices. GE remained flat for almost two\nmonths following those two opposing spikes.\nTechnical patterns confirm one another when they give similar mes-\nsages. The downward spike in area C showed that the downtrend was\nbecoming exhausted. That bullish signal was followed by a bullish diver-\ngence between prices and Force Index, which traced a series of higher bot-\ntoms while prices tried to grind lower. For fans of classical charting, there\nwas a “reverse head-and-shoulders” pattern. Finally, there was a kangaroo\ntail at the very low. It looks as if GE keeps ringing a bell and telling us thatthe decline is over, it is ready to go up! In area D, half-way through the rise\nfrom 37 to 53, Force Index starts tracing a bearish divergence, warning\nthat bulls are losing power. When the EMA follows this up by turning\ndown in May, the bullish game is over. It is the last good chance to takeprofits and position short.\nAt the right edge of the chart the EMA is down and prices have just fallen\nto a new low, but Force Index is starting to trace a bullish divergence. It tells\nyou to tighten stops on short positions.\nS S\nTail\nH\nAB\nCD\n112 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nyou have several exit strategies. If you’re very short-term oriented, sell the\nday after Force Index turns positive, but if your time horizon is wider, holduntil prices hit their channel line or the EMA turns flat.\nWhen the 22-day EMA of prices is down, and the two-day EMA of Force\nIndex rallies above zero, it reveals a short-term splash of bullishness withina downtrend, a shorting opportunity. If you’re very short-term oriented,grab a quick profit and cover the day after Force Index turns negative. Ifyour time horizon is wider, use the lower channel wall for the profit target.\nWhen the two-day EMA of Force Index spikes up or down, exceeding its\nnormal peaks or lows by several times, it identifies an exhaustion move—a signal to take profits on existing positions.\nWhen the trend is up and the two-day EMA of Force Index traces a\nsharp upward spike, eight or more times above its normal height for thepast two months, it marks a buying panic. The bulls are afraid of missingthe train and bears feel trapped and cover shorts at any cost. Such spikestend to occur during end-stages of bull moves. They tell you it is a goodtime to take profits on long positions. Prices often rally to retest the spikeday’s high. By then the spirit is gone from the rally and other indicatorsstart developing bearish divergences, warning of a trend reversal.\nWhen the two-day EMA of Force Index traces a sharp downward spike\nduring a downtrend, four or more times deeper than normal for the pasttwo months, it marks an hysterical stage of the downmove. It identifies aselling panic among the bulls, who are dumping their holdings at anyprice to get out. Such spikes tend to occur at the end-stages of bear moves.They tell you that it’s a good time to take profits on short positions. Pricessometimes retest the spike day’s low, but by then most indicators aredeveloping bullish divergences and an upside reversal is coming.\nSpikes are somewhat similar to the kangaroo tails we discussed earlier\n(see “The Reality of the Chart” on page 73). The difference between themis that tails are purely price-based, while Force Index reflects volume aswell as prices. Tails and spikes identify panics among the weakest players.Once they get flushed out, the trend is ready to reverse.\nA Reversal Is Coming Trend reversals do not have to come as a surprise;\ndivergences between Force Index and price usually precede them. If themarket is trying to rally, but the peaks in Force Index are becoming lower,it is a sign of weakness among the bulls. If a stock or a future is trying todecline, but the bottoms in Force Index are becoming more shallow, it isa sign of weakness among the bears.\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 113\nFigure 5.12 Force Index—13-Day EMA\nA longer-term Force Index, smoothed with a 13-day EMA, identifies longer-\nterm shifts of power between bulls and bears. When it is below zero, bears\nare in control, and when it is above that line, the bulls are in charge.Divergences between the peaks of this indicator and price peaks precedemarket tops, whereas divergences between their lows precede importantbottoms.\nIn area A, Force Index traces a lower peak during the final price peak. It\nreveals that bulls are weak and a top is likely. A few days later, the EMA ticksdown, confirming that a new downtrend has begun. A mirror image of thispattern occurs in area B, where we see a lower closing price, a higher bot-\ntom of Force Index, and a few days later an uptick of the EMA, auguring an\nimportant rally. Notice also the double bottom in that area—a kangaroo tail,followed by a retest of the lows. This is one of many examples of patterns andindicators reinforcing each other. In area C Force Index traces a bearishdivergence and warns you that the bull move is over. A few days later the\nEMA ticks down, and it’s all downhill from there. The market keeps sending\nyou messages—all you have to do is listen.\nAt the right edge of the chart the market is declining, confirmed by the\nfalling EMA. Force Index is starting to trace a bullish divergence; it is time totighten stops on short positions.\nA Tail B C\n114 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nA divergence between an EMA of Force Index and price shows that the\ntrend is ready to reverse. Divergences between the patterns of peaks or\nbottoms of Force Index and prices show that the trend is becomingweaker. The power of this message depends on the length of the EMA withwhich we smooth our Force Index. If we use a very short EMA of ForceIndex, such as two days, its divergences help pinpoint the ends of short-\nterm trends lasting a week or so. If we use a 13-day or longer EMA ofForce Index, we can identify the ends of longer-term moves that last months.\nIf the trend is up and you are long, take profits when the two-day EMA\nof Force Index traces a bearish divergence—a lower peak in the indica-tor during a higher price in the market. If you are short, take profits whenthe two-day EMA of Force Index traces a bullish divergence—a higherbottom in the indicator during a lower price in the market. Take yourprofits and monitor the market from the sidelines. It is cheaper to exit andreenter than sit through a countertrend move.\nIt is essential to combine Force Index with trend-following indicators. If\nyou use this oscillator alone, it will lead to overtrading because it is so sen-sitive. In that case, only your broker will make money. The signals of ashort-term oscillator must be filtered using a long-term trend-followingindicator. This is the key principle of the Triple Screen trading system.\nThe Fifth Bullet\nA clip for an old army rifle held only five bullets. Going into action withsuch a weapon forced one to take good aim instead of shooting wildly.This is a good attitude for trading the markets.\nBy now, we have selected four bullets—exponential moving averages,\nchannels, MACD-Histogram, and Force Index. A moving average andMACD are trend-following indicators. Channels, Force Index, and MACD-Histogram are oscillators. What fifth bullet shall we pick?\nTo help you choose your fifth bullet, we’ll review several more tools.\nFeel free to range beyond this menu, but make sure to understand howeach indicator is constructed and what it measures. Test your indicators todevelop confidence in their signals.\nInTrading for a Living I described more than a dozen technical indi-\ncators. There are dozens more in other books on technical analysis.Quality and the depth of understanding are more important than quantity.A drowning amateur, grasping at straws, keeps adding indicators. Amature trader selects a few effective tools, learns to use them well, andfocuses on system development and money management.TEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nThere are no magic bullets in the markets. There is no perfect or\nultimate indicator. A trader who becomes preoccupied with indicators\nquickly reaches the point of diminishing returns. Your choice of analytictools depends on your trading style. The idea is to select your tools andquickly move on to where the real money is—system development andrisk management.\nElder-ray Elder-ray is an indicator developed by this author and named\nfor its similarity to x-rays. It shows the structure of bullish and bearishpower below the surface of the markets. Elder-ray combines a trend-following moving average with two oscillators to show when to enterand exit long or short positions. Most software developers fail to in-clude Elder-ray in their packages, but you can do it yourself with minimal\nprogramming.\nTo plot Elder-ray, divide your computer screen into three horizontal\npanels. Plot a chart of the stock you plan to analyze in the top panel andadd an exponential moving average. The second and third panels willcontain Bull Power and Bear Power, plotted as histograms. Here are theElder-ray formulae:\nBull Power =High −EMA\nBear Power =Low −EMA\nA moving average reflects the average consensus of value. The high of\neach bar reflects the maximum power of bulls during that bar. The low ofeach bar marks the maximum power of bears during that bar.\nElder-ray works by comparing the power of bulls and bears during each\nbar with the average consensus of value. Bull Power reflects the maximumpower of bulls relative to the average consensus, and Bear Power the max-imum power of bears relative to that consensus.\nWe plot Bull Power in the second windowpane as a histogram. Its\nheight reflects the distance between the top of the price bar and theEMA—the maximum power of bulls. We plot Bear Power in the third win-dowpane. Its depth reflects the distance between the low of the price barand the EMA—the maximum power of bears.\nWhen the high of a bar is above the EMA, Bull Power is positive. When\nthe entire bar sinks below the EMA, which happens during severe de-clines, Bull Power becomes negative. When the low of a bar is below theEMA, Bear Power is negative. When the entire bar rises above the EMA,which happens during wild rallies, Bear Power becomes positive.METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 115\n116 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThe slope of a moving average identifies the current trend of the mar-\nket. When it rises, it shows that the crowd is becoming more bullish; it isa good time to be long. When it falls, it shows that the crowd is becomingmore bearish; it is a good time to be short. Prices keep getting away froma moving average but snap back to it, as if pulled by a rubber band. BullPower and Bear Power show the length of that rubber band. Knowing the\nFigure 5.13 Elder-ray\n“Buy low, sell high” sounds good, but traders and investors seem to have\nbeen more comfortable buying Lucent above 70 than below 7. Perhaps they\nare not as rational as the efficient market theorists would like us to believe?Elder-ray gives rational traders a glimpse into what is going on below the sur-face of the market.\nWhen the trend, identified by the 22-day EMA, is down and bulls are\nunder water, the rallies back to the surface mark shorting opportunities\n(arrows A and B). Prices draw a kangaroo tail in area C, and a sharp rally fol-lows. A rise from 5.50 to 11.50 is nothing to sneeze at; cheaper stocks tendto have bigger percentage gains. In area D, Lucent slides to a new low, but\nBear Power traces a more shallow bottom, completing a bullish divergence.\nThat false downside breakout traps bears. As the rally accelerates, Bear\npower becomes positive and each dip of Bear power back to its zero linemarks a buying opportunity (area E).\nAB\nCE D bull power\nbear power\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 117\nnormal height of Bull or Bear Power reveals how far prices are likely to get\naway from their moving average before returning. Elder-ray offers one ofthe best insights into where to take profits—at a distance away from themoving average that equals the average Bull Power or Bear Power.\nElder-ray gives buy signals in uptrends when Bear Power turns nega-\ntive and then ticks up. A negative Bear Power means that the bar is strad-dling the EMA, with its low below the average consensus of value. Waitingfor Bear Power to turn negative forces you to buy value rather than chaserunaway moves. The actual buy signal is given by an uptick of Bear Power,which shows that bears are starting to lose their grip and the uptrend isabout to resume. Take profits at the upper channel line or when a trend-following indicator stops rising. Profits may be greater if you ride theuptrend to its conclusion, but taking profits at the upper channel line ismore reliable.\nElder-ray gives shorting signals in downtrends when Bull Power turns\npositive and then ticks down. We can identify the downtrend by a declin-ing daily or weekly EMA. A positive Bull Power shows that the bar is strad-dling the EMA, with its high above the average consensus of value.Waiting for Bull Power to turn positive before shorting forces you to sellat or above value instead of chasing waterfall declines. The actual short-ing signal is given by a downtick of Bull Power, which shows that bullsare starting to slip and the downtrend is about to resume. Once short, takeprofits at the lower channel line or when the trend-following indicatorstops falling, depending on your style. You can make more money byholding on for the duration of the downtrend, but it is easier to achievesteady results by taking profits at the lower channel line. A beginningtrader is better off learning to catch short swings, while leaving long-termtrend trading for a later stage of development.\nStochastic This oscillator identifies overbought and oversold condi-\ntions, helping us buy low or sell high. Just as important, it helps avoidbuying at high prices or shorting at low prices. This indicator was popu-larized by George Lane decades ago and is now included in most soft-ware packages.\nStochastic measures the capacity of bulls to close prices near the top of\nthe recent trading range and the capacity of bears to close them near thebottom. It ties the high of the range, representing the maximum powerof bulls, with the low, representing the maximum power of bears, andwith closing prices, the final balance in the markets, representing theactions of smart money.\n118 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nBulls may push prices higher during the day, or bears may push them\nlower, but Stochastic measures their performance at closing time—the cru-cial money-counting time in the markets. If bulls lift prices during the daybut cannot close them near the high of the recent range, Stochastic turnsdown, identifying weakness and giving a sell signal. If bears push pricesdown during the day but cannot close them near the lows, Stochastic turnsup, identifying strength and giving a buy signal.\nThere are two types of Stochastic: Fast and Slow. Both consist of two\nlines: the fast line, called %K, and the slow line, called %D. We constructFast Stochastic in two steps and Slow Stochastic in three steps:\n1.Obtain %K,the fast line.\nwhere Close\ntoday=today’s close\nLown=the lowest low for the selected number of bars\nHighn=the highest high for the selected number of bars\nn =the number of bars for Stochastic (selected by the trader)\nWe have to choose the number of days, or bars, over which to calculate\nStochastic—the value of n. If we use a low number, below 10, Stochasticwill focus on the recent bars and flag minor turning points. If we choosea wider window, Stochastic will look at more data and flag major turns,missing minor ones.\nHow wide should we make the Stochastic window? Since we use oscil-\nlators to catch reversals, short-term windows are better; we should reservelonger time windows for trend-following indicators. Five or seven days area good starting point, but consider testing longer parameters to find theones that work best in your market.\n2.Obtain %D, the slow line. We obtain %D by smoothing the fast line\n%K over a number of bars that is shorter than %K. For example, if wedecide to plot a five-day Stochastic, we will use the value of five for the%K formula, above, and three bars for the %D formula, below:\n% • DClose Low\nHigh Lowtoday n\nnn=− ()\n− ()Three-bar sum of \nThree-bar sum of 100% • KClose Low\nHigh Lowtoday n\nnn=−\n−100\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 119\nFast Stochastic is very sensitive to price changes, making its lines appear\njagged. It pays to add one more step and convert it into a smoother SlowStochastic. Of course, a computer does this all automatically.\n3.Convert Fast Stochastic into Slow Stochastic. The slow line of Fast\nStochastic becomes the fast line of Slow Stochastic. Repeat step 2, above,to obtain the slow line %D of Slow Stochastic.\nStochastic is designed to oscillate between 0 and 100. Low levels mark\noversold markets, and high levels mark overbought markets. Overboughtmeans too high, ready to turn down. Oversold means too low, ready toturn up. Draw horizontal reference lines at levels that have marked previoustops and bottoms, starting with 15 near the lows and 85 near the highs.\nLook for buying opportunities when Stochastic nears its lower reference\nline. Look for selling opportunities when Stochastic nears its upper refer-ence line. Buying when Stochastic is low is emotionally hard because mar-\nkets usually look terrible near bottoms, which is precisely the right time tobuy. When Stochastic rallies to its upper reference line, it tells you to startlooking for selling opportunities. This also goes against the grain emo-tionally. When Stochastic rallies to a top, the market often looks fantastic,which is a good time to sell.\nWe should not use Stochastic alone, in a mechanical manner. When a\nstrong uptrend takes off, Stochastic quickly becomes overbought and startsflashing sell signals. In a powerful bear market, Stochastic becomes oversoldand flashes premature buy signals. This indicator works well only if you useit with a trend-following indicator and take only those Stochastic signals thatpoint in the direction of the main trend.\nShould a trader wait for Stochastic to turn up to recognize a buy signal?\nShould he wait for it to turn down to recognize a sell signal? Not really,because by the time Stochastic turns, a new move is usually under way. Ifyou are looking for an opportunity to enter, the mere fact of Stochasticreaching an extreme gives you a signal.\nGo long when Stochastic traces a bullish divergence, that is, when prices\nfall to a new low but the indicator makes a more shallow low. Go shortwhen Stochastic traces a bearish divergence, that is, when prices rise to anew high but the indicator ticks down from a lower peak than during theprevious rally. In an ideal buying situation, the first Stochastic low is below\nand the second above the lower reference line. The best sell signals occurwhen the first top of Stochastic is above and the second below the upperreference line.\n120 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAB C D E F G H I\nFigure 5.14 Stochastic\nIt may feel good to buy when prices are high and it brings relief to sell\nwhen prices fall, but Stochastic helps you do the right thing—buy low andsell high. When it declines to its lower reference line, it tells you themarket is oversold and gives a signal to buy (points B, C, and F). Whether\nyou buy or not, low Stochastic prevents you from shorting when it falls to\nlow levels.\nWhen Stochastic rises to its upper reference line, it gives a sell signal\n(points A, D, G, and H). A sell signal may be premature in a strong uptrend,\nbut whether you take it or not, one thing is clear—it is too late to buy.\nStochastic helps you avoid chasing trends.\nDivergences give the strongest signals. At point E, Exxon rises to a dou-\nble top, while Stochastic traces a lower top—a bearish divergence, a strongsell signal. A powerful rally begins in March, but by May there is a bearish\ndivergence—a sign that the party is coming to an end. There is one more\nchance to sell and go short when a triple bearish divergence appears at\npoint I—it is all downhill from there.\nAt the right edge of the chart XOM is declining, confirmed by the falling\nEMA. Stochastic is trying to trace a bullish divergence, but the second bot-\ntom is almost as low as the first; the bears are very strong, and the decline\nis likely to continue.\nMETHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 121\nDo not buy when Stochastic is above its upper reference line and do not\nsell short when it is below its lower reference line. These “no go” rules are\nprobably the most useful messages of Stochastic. Moving averages are bet-ter than Stochastic at identifying trends, MACD-Histogram is better at iden-tifying reversals, channels are better at identifying profit targets, and ForceIndex is sharper at catching entry and exit points. The trouble with themis that they give action signals most of the time. Stochastic identifies dan-ger zones, just like a line of red flags on a ski slope marks unsafe areasfor skiers. It says “no go” just when you feel tempted to chase a trend.\nReady to Hunt? Your choice of indicators depends on personal prefer-\nences, just like selecting a car. Be sure to combine trend-following indicators,which identify trends, with oscillators, which identify reversals.\nIn addition to the indicators described above, you may want to take a\nlook at the Directional indicator, which does a good job of signalingtrends. It consists of several components, one of which, ADX, helps iden-tify new bull markets. Williams %R is an oscillator similar to Stochastic,especially useful for showing when to pyramid winning positions. RelativeStrength Index (RSI) is an oscillator based entirely on closing prices. Ithelps track the behavior of market professionals who tend to dominatemarkets at closing time. All of them are described in Trading for a Living .\nKeep in mind that no single indicator can guarantee you victory in the\ntrading game. Trend-following indicators, such as moving averages, catchtrends but produce whipsaws in trading ranges. Oscillators identify topsand bottoms during trading ranges but flash premature countertrend sig-nals when the markets begin to run. Trading signals are easy to recognizein the middle of the chart, but hard to see at the right edge.\nThere is no magic indicator. All indicators are building blocks of trad-\ning systems. A good system uses several tools, combining them so thattheir negative features filter each other out, while their positive featuresremain undisturbed.\nCHAPTER\nSIX\nTRADING\nBeginners become emotional when they trade, but if you want to\nsurvive and succeed, you must develop discipline. The moment\nyou become aware of feeling fear or joy, use that as a signal to tightenyour discipline and follow your system. You developed that systemwhen the markets were closed and you felt calm. Now it gives youyour only chance of survival and success in the markets.\nThe idea of an automatic trading system is fundamentally flawed. If\nthose systems could work, then the smartest guy with the biggest com-puter would have cornered the market long ago. Automatic systems donot work because the market is not a mechanical or electronic entitythat follows the laws of physics. It is a huge crowd of people acting inaccordance with the imperfect laws of mass psychology. Physics andmathematics can help, but trading decisions must take psychology intoaccount.\nWhen you talk with a pro, one of the first questions he’ll ask—or\nnot even ask because he’ll know the answer from a few of your com-ments—is whether you are a discretionary trader or a system trader.\nA discretionary trader takes in market information and analyzes it using\nseveral technical tools. He is likely to shift and apply somewhat differenttools to different markets at different times. His decision-making tree hasmany branches, and he follows them at different times as market condi-tions change. All branches are connected to the sturdy trunk of his deci-sion-making tree, an inviolate set of rules for risk control.\nA system trader develops a mechanical set of rules for entering and\nexiting trades. He backtests them and puts them on autopilot. At thatpoint, an amateur and a pro go in opposite directions. An amateur,frightened by the market, feels relieved that a system, either his own\n123\nor bought from someone else, will free him from worry. Market con-\nditions always change and all systems self-destruct, which is why everyamateur with a mechanical system must lose money in the end. A prowho puts his system on autopilot continues to monitor it like a hawk.He knows the difference between a normal drawdown period and atime when a system deteriorates and has to be shelved and replaced.A professional system trader can afford to use a mechanical system pre-cisely because he is capable of discretionary trading!\nIn my experience, system traders tend to achieve more consistent\nresults, but the best and most successful traders use the discretionaryapproach. The choice depends on your temperament rather than acold business decision. Some people feel attracted to system trading,others to discretionary trading. Much of what you read in this bookdeals with discretionary trading. All of these components can be usedin systematic trading. This book is written to help both types of traders.\nA trading system is an action plan for the market, but no plan can\nanticipate everything. A degree of judgment is always required, evenwith the best and most reliable plans.\nThink of any other plan or system in your life. For example, you\nprobably have a system for taking your car out of the garage. You needto open the garage door, start the car, warm up the engine, and pullthe car out into the street without bumping into walls, running over tri-cycles, or getting hit by passing trucks.\nYou have a system in the sense that you perform the same actions\neach time in the same sequence, not thinking of the routine but pay-ing attention to what is important—watching out for dangers, such askids on bicycles, or freshly fallen snow, or a neighbor crossing thesidewalk. When you detect an obstacle, you deviate from your system,and return to it after the situation returns to normal. You would not tryto design a complete system, which would include dealing with thesnow, and the bicyclists, and the neighbors because that system wouldbe too complex and still could never be complete—a neighbor couldcome into your car’s path from another angle. A system automates rou-tine actions and allows you to exercise discretion when needed.\nAnd that’s what you need in the markets—a system for finding\ntrades, setting stops, establishing profit targets—all the while payingattention to a heavy truck headed toward you in the shape of a FederalReserve announcement or a kid on a tricycle in the form of a disap-pointing earnings report. Many beginners set themselves the impossible124 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\ntask of designing or buying a complete trading system, which is just as\nimpossible as a complete system for pulling your car out of the garage.\nI have two friends who earn a good living testing systems for traders.\nBoth are expert programmers. One of them laughed as he told me howhe gets at least one phone call a week from yet another amateur whothinks he has discovered the Holy Grail. He wants his automatic set ofrules backtested to find the best parameters, and his only concern is thatthe programmer should not steal his secret! I asked my friend how manyprofitable automatic systems he found during several years of backtesting.\nNot one.Not one? Doesn’t he get discouraged doing this kind of work?Well, what keeps him going is that he has a handful of steady clients\nwho are successful professional traders. They bring him snippets oftrading methods for testing. They may test their parameters for placingstops, the length of MACD, and so on. Then they use their own judg-ment to bind those snippets into a decision-making tree.\nAn intelligent trading system includes components that have been\nbacktested, but the trader retains control over his actions. He has sev-eral inviolate rules, mostly having to do with risk control and moneymanagement, but allows himself latitude in combining those compo-nents to reach trading decisions.\nAn intelligent trading system is an action plan for entering and exit-\ning markets that spells out several specific functions, such as findingtrades or protecting capital. Most actions, such as entries, exits, andadjusting stops, can be partly but not fully automated. Thinking is ahard job; a mechanical trading system tempts you by promising youwon’t have to think any more, but that’s a false promise. To be a suc-cessful trader you need to use your judgment. A trading system is astyle of trading, not an automatic turnkey operation.\nSYSTEM TESTING\nYou must test each indicator, rule, and method before including themin your trading system. Many traders do this by dumping historical datainto testing software and obtaining a printout of their system’s param-eters. The profit-loss ratio, the biggest and the smallest profit or loss,the average profit and loss, the longest winning and losing streaks, theaverage profit, and the average or the maximum drawdowns give theappearance of objectivity and solidity.TRADING 125\nThose printouts provide a false sense of security.\nYou may have a very nice printout, but what if the system delivers\nfive losses in a row, while you trade real money? Nothing in your test-ing has prepared you for that, but it happens all the time. You grit yourteeth and put on another trade. Another loss. Your drawdown is get-ting deeper. Will you put on the next trade? Suddenly, an impressiveprintout looks like a very thin reed on which to hang your future, whileyour account is being whittled away.\nThe attraction of electronic testing is such that there is now a small\ncottage industry of programmers who test systems for a fee. Sometraders spend months, if not years, learning to use testing software. Aloser who cannot admit he’s afraid to trade has a wonderful excuse thathe is learning new software. He’s like a swimmer who is afraid of water\nand keeps himself busy ironing his swimsuit.\nOnly one kind of system testing makes sense. It is slow, it is time-\nconsuming, and it does not lend itself to testing a hundred markets atonce, but it’s the only method that prepares you for trading. It consistsof going through historical data one day at a time, scrupulously writ-ing down your trading signals for the day ahead, then clicking yourchart forward and recording the trades and signals for the next day.\nBegin by downloading your stock or futures data for a minimum of\ntwo years. Swing to the left side of the file, without looking at whathappened next. Open your technical analysis program and a spread-sheet. The two most important keys for traders on a computer are Altand Tab because they let you switch between two programs. Open twowindows in your analytic program—one for your long-term chart withits indicators, the other for the short-term chart. Open a spreadsheet,write down your system’s rules at the top of the page and createcolumns for the date, entry date and price, and the exit date and price.\nTurn to the weekly chart and note its signal, if any. If it gives you a\nbuy or sell signal, go to the daily chart ending on the same date to seewhether it gives you a buy or a sell signal as well. If it does, record theorder you have to place in your spreadsheet. Now return to the dailychart and click one day forward. See whether your buy or sell order wastriggered. If so, return to the spreadsheet and record the result. Track yourtrade day by day, calculating stops and deciding where to take profits.\nFollow this process throughout your entire data file, advancing a\nweek at a time on the weekly chart, a day at a time on the daily chart.At every click write down your system’s signals and your actions.126 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAs you click forward, one day at a time, the market history will\nslowly unfold and challenge you. You click and a buy signal comesinto view. Will you take it? Record your decision in a spreadsheet. Willyou take profits at a set target, on a sell signal, or on the basis of priceaction? You are doing much more than testing a set of rigid rules.Moving ahead day by day, you develop your decision-making skills.This one-bar-at-a-time forward testing is vastly superior to what you getfrom backtesting software.\nHow will you deal with gap openings when prices open above your\nbuy level or below your stop? What about limit moves in futures?Should the system be adjusted, changed, or scrapped? Clicking forwardone day at a time gets you as close to the real experience of trading asyou can ever get without putting on a trade. It puts you in touch withthe raw edge of the market, which you can never experience throughan orderly printout from a professional system tester.\nManual testing will improve your ability to think, recognize events,\nand act in the foggy environment of the market. Your trading plansmust include certain absolute rules, most of them concerning moneymanagement. As long as you stay within those rules, you have muchfreedom in trading the markets. Your growing levels of knowledge,maturity, judgment, and skill are much more important assets than anycomputerized testing.\nPaper Trading\nPaper trading means recording your decision to trade and tracking it asif it were a real trade, only without money. Most of those who papertrade have lost their nerve after getting beat up by the markets. Somepeople alternate between real trades and paper trades and cannotunderstand why they seem to make money on paper but lose when-ever they put on a real trade.\nThis happens for two reasons. First, people tend to be less emotional\nwith paper. Good decisions are easier to make when your money is noton the line. Second, good trades often look murky at entry time. Theeasy-looking ones are more likely to lead to problems. A nervous begin-ner jumps into obvious-looking trades but paper trades the more prom-ising ones. It goes without saying that hopping between real tradingand paper trading is sheer nonsense. You either do one or the other.\nThere is only one good reason to paper trade—to test your discipline.TRADING 127\nIf you can download your data at the end of each day, do your\nhomework, write down your orders for the day ahead, watch the open-ing and record your entries, and then track your market each day,adjusting your profit targets and stops—if you can do all of this for sev-eral months in a row, recording your actions, without skipping a day—then you probably have the discipline to trade that market. Someonewho is in it for entertainment will not be able to paper trade this waybecause it requires work.\nTo paper trade your system, download your data at the end of each\nday. Apply your tools and techniques, reach trading decisions, calculatestops and profit targets, and write them down for tomorrow. Do not placeyour orders with a broker, but check whether they would have been trig-gered and write down those fills. Enter paper trades in your spreadsheetand your trading diary (see Chapter 8, “The Organized Trader”). If youhave the willpower to repeat this process daily for several months, thenyou have the discipline for successful trading with real money.\nStill, there is no substitute for trading with real money, because it\nengages emotions more than any paper trade. It is better to learn byputting on very small real trades than paper trades.\nTRIPLE SCREEN UPDATE\nOne of the most pleasant encounters that occur several times each yearis when a trader comes up to me at some conference and tells me howhe started trading for a living after studying my book or participatingin a Camp. At that point, he may be living and trading on a moun-taintop, and as often as not he owns the mountaintop. I noticed longago that half-way through our conversation these people becomeslightly apologetic. They tell me they use Triple Screen, but not exactlythe way I taught it. They may have modified an indicator, addedanother screen, substituted a tool, and so forth. Whenever I hear that,I know I am talking to a winner.\nFirst of all, I tell them they owe their success primarily to themselves.\nI did not teach them any differently than the dozens of others in thesame class. Winners have the discipline to take what is offered and useit to succeed. Second, I see their apology for having changed someaspects of my system as an indication of their winning attitude. To ben-efit from a system, you must test its parameters and fine-tune them untilthat system becomes your own, even though originally it was developedby someone else. Winning takes discipline, discipline comes from confi-128 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\ndence, and the only system in which you can have confidence is the\none you have tested on your own data and adapted to your own style.\nI developed the Triple Screen trading system in the mid-1980s and\nfirst presented it to the public in 1986 in an article in Futures magazine .\nI updated it in Trading for a Living and several videos. Here I will\nreview it, focusing on recent enhancements.\nWhat is a trading system? What’s the difference between a method,\na system, and a technique?\nA method is a general philosophy of trading. For example; trade with the\ntrend, buy when the trend is up, and sell after it tops out. Or—buyundervalued markets, go long near historical support levels, and sellafter resistance zones have been reached.\nA system is a set of rules for implementing a method. For example, if our\nmethod is to follow trends, then the system may buy when a multi-weekmoving average turns up and sell when a daily moving average turnsdown (get in slow, get out fast). Or—buy when the weekly MACD-Histogram ticks up and sell after it ticks down.\nA technique is a specific rule for entering or exiting trades. For example,\nwhen a system gives a buy signal, the technique could be to buy whenprices exceed the high of the previous day or if prices make a new lowduring the day but close near the high.\nThe method of Triple Screen is to analyze markets in several time-\nframes and use both the trend-following indicators and oscillators. Wemake a strategic decision to trade long or short using trend-followingindicators on long-term charts. We make tactical decisions to enter orexit using oscillators on shorter-term charts. The original method hasnot changed, but the system—the exact choice of indicators—hasevolved over the years, as have the techniques.\nTriple Screen examines each potential trade using three screens or\ntests. Each screen uses a different timeframe and indicators. Thesescreens filter out many trades that seem attractive at first. Triple Screenpromotes a careful and cautious approach to trading.\nConflicting Indicators\nTechnical indicators help identify trends or turns more objectively thanchart patterns. Just keep in mind that when you change indicatorparameters, you influence their signals. Be careful not to fiddle withindicators until they tell you what you want to hear.TRADING 129\nWe can divide all indicators into three major groups:\nTrend-following indicators help identify trends. Moving averages,\nMACD lines, Directional system, and others rise when the markets arerising, decline when markets fall, and go flat when markets enter trad-ing ranges.\nOscillators help catch turning points by identifying overbought and\noversold conditions. Envelopes or channels, Force Index, Stochastic,Elder-ray, and others show when rallies or declines outrun themselvesand are ready to reverse.\nMiscellaneous indicators help gauge the mood of the market crowd.\nBullish Consensus, Commitments of Traders, New High–New Low Index,and others reflect the general levels of bullishness or bearishness inthe market.\nDifferent groups of indicators often give conflicting signals. Trend-\nfollowing indicators may turn up, telling us to buy, while oscillatorsbecome overbought, telling us to sell. Trend-following indicators mayturn down, giving sell signals, while oscillators become oversold, giv-ing buy signals. It is easy to fall into the trap of wishful thinking andstart following those indicators whose message you like. A trader mustset up a system that takes all groups of indicators into account andhandles their contradictions.\nConflicting Timeframes\nAn indicator can call an uptrend and a downtrend in the same stock onthe same day. How can this be? A moving average may rise on a weeklychart, giving a buy signal, but fall on a daily chart, giving a sell signal.It may rally on an hourly chart, telling us to go long, but sink on a 10-minute chart, telling us to short. Which of those signals should we take?\nAmateurs reach for the obvious. They grab a single timeframe, most\noften daily, apply their indicators and ignore other timeframes. Thisworks only until a major move swells up from the weeklies or a sharpspike erupts from the hourly charts and flips their trade upside down.Whoever said that ignorance was bliss was not a trader.\nPeople who have lost money with daily charts often imagine they\ncould do better by speeding things up and using live data. If you can-not make money with dailies, a live screen will only help you losefaster. Screens hypnotize losers, but a determined one can get even closerto the market by renting a seat and going to trade on the floor. Prettysoon a margin clerk for the clearing house notices that the new trader’s130 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nequity has dropped below limit. He sends a runner into the pit who\ntaps that person on the shoulder. The loser steps out and is never seenagain—he has “tapped out.”\nThe problem with losers is not that their data is too slow, but their\ndecision-making process is a mess. To resolve the problem of conflict-ing timeframes, you should not get your face closer to the market, butpush yourself further away, take a broad look at what’s happening,make a strategic decision to be a bull or a bear, and only then returncloser to the market and look for entry and exit points. That’s whatTriple Screen is all about.\nWhat is long term and what is short term? Triple Screen avoids rigid\ndefinitions by focusing instead on the relationships between time-frames. It requires you to begin by choosing your favorite timeframe,which it calls intermediate. If you like to work with daily charts, yourintermediate timeframe is daily. If you are a day-trader and like five-minute charts, then your intermediate timeframe is the five-minutechart, and so on.\nTriple Screen defines the long term by multiplying the intermediate\ntimeframe by five (see “Time—The Factor of Five,” page 87). If yourintermediate timeframe is daily, then your long-term timeframe is weekly.\nIf your intermediate timeframe is five minutes, then your long-term ishalf-hourly, and so forth. Choose your favorite timeframe, call it inter-mediate, and immediately move up one order of magnitude to along-term chart. Make your strategic decision there, and return to the\nintermediate chart to look for entries and exits.\nThe key principle of Triple Screen is to begin your analysis by step-\nping back from the markets and looking at the big picture for strategicdecisions. Use a long-term chart to decide whether you are bullish orbearish, and then return closer to the market to make tactical choicesabout entries and exits.\nThe Principles of Triple Screen\nTriple Screen resolves contradictions between indicators and time-frames. It reaches strategic decisions on long-term charts, using trend-following indicators—this is the first screen. It proceeds to maketactical decisions about entries and exits on the intermediate charts,using oscillators—this is the second screen. It offers several methodsfor placing buy and sell orders—this is the third screen, which we mayimplement using either intermediate- or short-term charts.TRADING 131\nBegin by choosing your favorite timeframe, the one with whose\ncharts you like to work, and call it intermediate. Multiply its length byfive to find your long-term timeframe. Apply trend-following indicatorsto long-term charts to reach a strategic decision to go long, short, orstand aside. Standing aside is a legitimate position. If the long-termchart is bullish or bearish, return to the intermediate charts and useoscillators to look for entry and exit points in the direction of the long-term trend. Set stops and profit targets before switching to short-termcharts, if available, to fine-tune entries and exits.\nS\nCREEN ONE\nChoose your favorite timeframe and call it intermediate. Multiply it by\nfive to find the long-term timeframe. Let’s say you prefer to work with\ndaily charts. In that case, move immediately one level higher, to theweekly chart. Do not permit yourself to peek at the dailies because thismay color your analysis of weekly charts. If you are a day-trader, youmight choose a 10-minute chart as your favorite, call it intermediate,and then immediately move up to the hourly chart, approximately fivetimes longer. Rounding off is not a problem; technical analysis is a craft,not an exact science. If you are a long-term investor, you might choosea weekly chart as your favorite and then go up to the monthly.\nApply trend-following indicators to the long-term chart and make a\nstrategic decision to trade long, short, or stand aside. The original ver-\nsion of Triple Screen used the slope of weekly MACD-Histogram as itsweekly trend-following indicator. It was very sensitive and gave manybuy and sell signals. I now prefer to use the slope of a weekly expo-nential moving average as my main trend-following indicator on long-term charts. When the weekly EMA rises, it confirms a bull move andtells us to go long or stand aside. When it falls, it identifies a bearmove and tells us to go short or stand aside. I use a 26-week EMA,which represents half a year of trading. You can test several differentlengths to see which tracks your market best, as you would with anyindicator.\nI continue to plot weekly MACD-Histogram. When both EMA and\nMACD-Histogram are in gear, they confirm a dynamic trend and en-courage you to trade larger positions. Divergences between weeklyMACD-Histogram and prices are the strongest signals in technicalanalysis, which override the message of the EMA.132 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTRADING 133\nAB\nFigure 6.1 Triple Screen—Weekly Chart\nGaming stocks tend to do well in a weak economy—gambling appeals to\npeople down on their luck. In 2000 and 2001, as the broad stock market wasdeclining, gaming stocks put in a stellar performance. Alliance Gaming, forinstance, rallied from below 2 to over 40, with very few pullbacks. Howcould Triple Screen help us benefit from this performance?\nThe pattern between points A and B is called a saucer bottom, a slow\ndrawn-out minimal decline and just as minimal a rise on hardly any vol-ume. Still, during that time ALLY had managed to put in a bullish diver-gence of MACD-Histogram, a hugely powerful signal that is rarely seenon weekly charts. It traced a low in area A, but could not even pushbelow zero at the bottom of the saucer. The first vertical arrow marks thepoint where MACD-Histogram starts trending higher. A few weeks laterthe weekly EMA also turns up, and at that point, with both weekly indi-cators trending up, ALLY becomes a screaming buy. It is time to switch tothe daily charts and look for buying opportunities. The second vertical\narrow marks another period when both the EMA and MACD-Histogramare in gear to the upside, and then the stock doubles in a few weeks. Theclean, steady uptrend of the weekly EMA keeps telling us to trade ALLYonly from the long side.\nAt the right edge of the chart, the weekly EMA keeps trending higher,\nbut wildly volatile price action shows that the easy portion of the uptrendis over. MACD-Histogram is moving opposite the EMA, warning of highvolatility ahead. The relatively easy money is off the table.\nSCREEN TWO\nReturn to the intermediate chart and use oscillators to look for trading\nopportunities in the direction of the long-term trend. When the weekly\ntrend is up, wait for daily oscillators to fall, giving buy signals. Buyingdips is safer than buying the crests of waves. If an oscillator gives a sellsignal while the weekly trend is up, you may use it to take profits onlong positions but not to sell short.134 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nFigure 6.2 Triple Screen—Daily Chart\nThe uptrend on the weekly chart keeps telling us to trade ALLY from the\nlong side or stand aside. With the daily EMA also rising, we have severaloptions. We may buy when prices pull back to their rising daily EMA, orwhen short-term Force Index dips below zero. The upper channel line pro-vides a logical profit-taking target. An experienced trader can pyramidhis position, adding to it whenever a new buy signal appears and onlytightening stops instead of exiting at the upper channel. That channel keepsgetting wider as prices rise—from 10 points wide in April to 16 in July.\nAt the right edge of the chart, the alternating spikes of Force Index\nwarn traders that the days of relatively easy money are over. The markethas become hysterical, and the likelihood of trend continuation is low.Better bank your winnings and go look for another stock in another groupthat is rising or falling quietly, not yet discovered by the market crowd.TEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nWhen the weekly trend is down, look for daily oscillators to rise,\ngiving sell signals. Shorting during upwaves is safer than selling newlows. When daily oscillators give buy signals, you may use them totake profits on shorts but not to buy. The choice of oscillators dependson your trading style.\nFor conservative traders, choose a relatively slow oscillator, such as\ndaily MACD-Histogram or Stochastic, for the second screen. When theweekly trend is up, look for daily MACD-Histogram to fall below zeroand tick up, or for Stochastic to fall to its lower reference line, givinga buy signal.\nReverse these rules for shorting in bear markets. When trend-\nfollowing indicators point down on the weekly charts, but daily MACD-Histogram ticks down from above its zero line, or Stochastic rallies toits upper reference line, they give sell signals.\nA conservative approach works best during early stages of major\nmoves, when markets gather speed slowly. As the trend accelerates,pullbacks become more shallow. To hop aboard a fast-running trend,you need faster oscillators.\nFor active traders, use the two-day EMA of Force Index (or longer,\nif that’s what your research suggests for your market). When theweekly trend is up and daily Force Index falls below zero, it flags abuying opportunity.\nReverse these rules for shorting in bear markets. When the weekly\ntrend is down and the two-day EMA of Force Index rallies above zero,it points to shorting opportunities.\nMany other indicators can work with Triple Screen. The first screen\ncan also use Directional System or trendlines. The second screen canuse Momentum, Relative Strength Index, Elder-ray, and others.\nThe second screen is where we set profit targets and stops and make\na go–no go decision about every trade after weighing the level of riskagainst the potential gain.\nSet the stops. A stop is a safety net, which limits the damage from any\nbad trade. You have to structure your trading in such a way that nosingle bad loss, or a nasty series of losses, can damage your account.Stops are essential for success, but many traders shun them. Beginnerscomplain about getting whipsawed, stopped out of trades that eventu-ally would have made them money. Some say that putting in a stopmeans asking for trouble because no matter where you put it, it willbe hit.TRADING 135\nFirst of all, you need to place stops where they are not likely to be\nhit, outside of the range of market noise (see SafeZone on page 173).Second, an occasional whipsaw is the price of long-term safety. Nomatter how great your analytic skills, stops are always necessary.\nYou should move stops only one way—in the direction of the trade.\nWhen a trade starts moving in your favor, move your stop to a break-even level. As the move persists, continue to move your stop, protect-ing some of your paper profit. A professional trader never lets a profitturn into a loss.\nA stop may never expose more than 2% of your equity to the risk of\nloss (see Chapter 7, “Money Management Formulas”). If Triple Screenflags a trade but you realize that a logical stop would risk more than2% of your equity, skip that trade.\nSet profit targets. Profit targets are flexible and depend on your goals\nand capital. If you are a well-capitalized, long-term-oriented trader, youmay build up a large position at an early stage of a bull market, repeat-edly taking buy signals from the daily charts, as long as the weeklytrend is up. Take your profits after the weekly EMA turns flat. The re-verse applies to downtrends.\nAnother option is to take profits whenever prices on the daily\ncharts hit their channel line. If you go long, sell when prices hit theupper channel line and look to reposition on the next pullback to thedaily moving average. If you go short, cover when prices fall to theirlower channel line and look to reposition short on the next rally tothe EMA.\nA short-term-oriented trader can use the signals of a two-day EMA\nof Force Index to exit trades. If you buy in an uptrend when the two-day EMA of Force Index turns negative, sell when it turns positive. Ifyou go short in a downtrend after the two-day EMA of Force Indexturns positive, cover when it turns negative.\nBeginners often approach markets like a lottery—buy a ticket and sit\nin front of the TV to find out whether you have won. You will knowthat you are becoming a professional when you start spending almostas much time thinking about exits as looking for entries.\nSCREEN THREE\nThe third screen helps us pinpoint entry points. Live data can help savvytraders but hurt beginners who may slip into day-trading.136 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nUse an intraday breakout or pullback to enter trades without real-\ntime data. When the first two screens give you a buy signal (the weekly\nis up, but the daily is down), place a buy order at the high of the pre-vious day or a tick higher. A tick is the smallest price fluctuation per-mitted in any market. We expect the major uptrend to reassert itself andcatch a breakout in its direction. Place a buy order, good for one dayonly. If prices break out above the previous day’s high, you will bestopped in automatically. You do not have to watch prices intraday,just give your order to a broker.\nWhen the first two screens tell you to sell short (the weekly is down,\nbut the daily is up), place a sell order at the previous day’s low or atick lower. We expect the downtrend to reassert itself, and try to catchthe downside breakout. If prices break below the previous day’s low,they will trigger your entry.\nDaily ranges can be very wide, and placing an order to buy at the\ntop can be expensive. Another option is to buy below the market. Ifyou are trying to buy a pullback to the EMA, calculate where that EMAis likely to be tomorrow and place your order at that level. Alternatively,use the SafeZone indicator (see page 173) to find how far the market islikely to dip below its previous day’s low and place your order at thatlevel. Reverse these approaches for shorting in downtrends.\nThe advantage of buying upside breakouts is that you follow an\nimpulse move. The disadvantage is that you buy high and your stop isfar away. The advantage of bottom fishing is that you get your goodson sale and your stop is closer. The disadvantage is the risk of gettingcaught in a downside reversal. A “breakout entry” is more reliable, butprofits are smaller; a “bottom-fishing entry” is riskier, but the profits aregreater. Make sure to test both methods in your markets.\nUse real-time data, if available, for entering trades. When the first\ntwo screens give you a buy signal (the weekly is up, but the daily isdown), use live data to get long. You could follow a breakout fromthe opening range, when prices rally above the high of the first 15 to30 minutes of trading, or apply technical analysis to intraday chartsand finesse your entry. When trying to short, you may enter on adownside breakout from the opening range. You could also monitorthe market intraday and use technical analysis to enter into a shorttrade, using live charts.\nThe techniques for finding buy and sell signals on real-time charts are\nthe same as on daily charts, only their speed is much higher. If you useTRADING 137\nweeklies and dailies to get in, use them also to get out. Once a live chart\ngives an entry signal, avoid the temptation to exit using intraday data.Do not forget that you entered that trade on the basis of weekly anddaily charts, expecting to hold for several days. Do not be distracted bythe intraday chop if you are trading swings that last several days.\nDAY-TRADING\nDay-trading means entering and exiting trades on the same day. Watch-ing money flow from the screen into your account is extremely appeal-ing. Surely we are smart enough to use modern technology to outrunslow-moving folks who follow their stocks through the newspapers.\nEvery partial truth contains a dangerous lie. Day-trading can bring\nprofits to professionals, but it is also a common last stop for losers whoblow what little is left of their accounts. Day-trading offers advantagesand disadvantages, while placing extreme demands on its practitioners.\nDay-trading offers one of the markets’ greatest challenges, but it\nis amazing how little literature on it exists. There are several “day-trading for dummies” types of books, a few get-rich-quick jobs, butnot a single definitive volume on day-trading. Bad day-traders writebad books and good day-traders are too action-oriented to sit downto write.\nA good day-trader is a street-smart person with fast reflexes. He is\nquick, confident, and flexible. Successful day-traders are so focused onthe immediate results that they do not make good writers. I hope oneof them will rise to the challenge of writing a book, but in the mean-time, here are a few notes, even though each of them deserves its ownchapter in a thick book on day-trading.\nThe late 1990s saw an explosion of interest in day-trading. Even\nhousewives and students were pulled in by the bull market and theeasy reach of the Internet. Brokers advertise for more people to comein to day-trade, knowing full well most will bust out.\nThe advantages of day-trading include:\nTrading opportunities are more frequent. If you can trade with daily\ncharts, you’ll see similar trades more often on intraday charts.\nYou can cut losses very quickly.There is no overnight risk if a major piece of news hits your market\nafter the close.138 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThe disadvantages of day-trading include:\nYou miss longer-term swings and trends.\nProfits are smaller because intraday swings are shorter.Expenses are higher because of more frequent commissions and\nslippage. Day-trading is a very expensive game, which is why ven-dors love it.\nDay-trading makes several hard demands on its practitioners:You must act instantly—if you stop to think, you’re dead. With daily\ncharts you have the luxury of time, but intraday charts demandimmediate action.\nDay-trading chews up a great deal of time. You have to ask yourself\nwhether the hourly pay is better in longer-term trading.\nDay-trading plays into people’s gambling tendencies. If there are any\ngaps in your discipline, day-trading will find them fast.\nThere are three main groups of day-traders: floor traders, institu-\ntional traders, and private traders. They have different agendas and usedifferent tools. Imagine three persons coming to the beach—one goesfor a swim, another stretches in the sun, and the third goes jogging andruns head on into a tree. Floor traders and institutional traders tend todo better than private traders. Let us see what we can learn from them.\nLessons from Floor Traders\nFloor traders stand in the pit, trading with each other, but more oftenagainst the public. They scalp, spread, and take directional trades.\nScalping is based on the fact that there are two prices for any stock\nor future. One is a bid—what the pros are offering to pay. The otheris an ask—what the pros are willing to sell for. You may bid below themarket, but as a friend said, “You can’t excite the market with a flac-cid bid.” When in a hurry, you buy at the ask and pay what sellersdemand. If you want to sell, you may place a limit order above themarket or “hit the bid” and accept what buyers are willing to pay.\nFor example, the last trade in gold was at 308.30, but now it is\nquoted as 308.20 bid, 308.40 ask. This means there are willing buyersat 308.20, while sellers are asking for 308.40. When a market order tobuy comes into the pit, a floor trader goes short by selling at 308.40.The outsider has paid the ask price, and the floor trader is now shortTRADING 139\nand needs to buy. When a market order to sell comes to the floor, he\nbuys at 308.20, and pockets 20 cents profit. Floor traders pay no com-missions, only clearing costs, and can afford to trade even for singleticks. They stand on their feet all day, yelling to all passersby that theywant to buy a tick below the market and sell a tick above. It is thehighest paid form of manual labor.\nThis is a simplified example. The reality is less orderly, as floor\ntraders try to widen the spread and make more than one or two ticks.They compete with one another, shouting, jumping, and getting intoeach other’s faces. It helps to be tall and muscular and have a bigvoice. You get stabbed with pencils and splattered with saliva. Thereis a story about a floor trader who died of a heart attack on the floorbut remained upright, squeezed in by the crowd.\nA floor trader can get stuck if he buys a tick below the market but\nthe market falls by two ticks, and puts him underwater. Half of all floortraders disappear in their first year. One of the Chicago exchanges putsred circular badges on the chest of new traders, making them look likeshooting targets. Lest you start feeling sorry for floor traders, keep inmind that many of them make a very good living and some make agreat deal of money from hitting you for a tick or more on every trade.Before electronic trading became a serious threat, seats on some ex-changes sold for a million dollars.\nFloor traders also get involved in spreading—buying and selling\nrelated markets when their relationships get out of line. Spread traderstend to be more cautious and better capitalized than scalpers. Finally,some of the wealthiest floor traders get involved in directional trading.They put on trades that last days or weeks, closer to the timeframe ofpublic traders.\nWhat lessons can we learn from the floor? If you are a position trader,\nyou should use limit orders whenever possible. Buy and sell at speci-fied prices, and don’t let the floor scalp you. Put those fellows on a diet.Another lesson is to stay away from scalping. When a crowd of athleticyoung men starts fighting for ticks, jumping, salivating, and screaming,you have no business reaching into that crowd to grab a few ticks foryourself because they’ll take off your fingers. If you day-trade awayfrom the floor, forget about scalping. Look for the longer-term day-trades, where the competition tapers off a bit. Go to the middle groundbetween scalpers who chase ticks and position traders with theirend-of-the-day charts. Try to find one or two trades a day, longer than\nscalping but shorter than position trades.140 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nLessons from Institutional Day-Traders\nInstitutional traders work for banks, brokerage houses, and similar\nfirms. A company may have more than a hundred traders sitting behindrows of expensive equipment. Maintaining each seat costs severalthousand dollars a month, not counting salaries and bonuses. Eachinstitutional trader narrowly focuses on a single market. One may tradeonly two-year Treasury notes, another only five-year notes, and so on.\nInstitutional traders generate paper-thin returns on huge volumes of\ncapital. A friend of mine who trades bonds for a leading investmentbank in New York has access to essentially unlimited capital during theday, but his overnight positions are capped at $250 million. His stan-dard deviation, the amount he usually wins or loses in a trading day,is $180,000. This is 0.072% of his overnight limit, and only about0.010% of his intraday size.\nHis profits appear large until you express them as a percentage of his\naccount and ask yourself what you would earn if you traded as well ashim. Suppose your account is $250,000 or one-thousandth of his $250million. If you could match my friend’s percentage gains, you’d earn$180 on overnight trades and $25 at the end of a busy day-trading ses-sion. That would hardly cover your costs! Why do institutions do it?\nThe big boys benefit from economies of scale, but the main reason\nthey stay in the game is to keep themselves visible to potential cus-tomers. Their main income comes from commissions and spreads oncustomer orders. Institutional traders accept paper-thin returns to main-tain a presence in the market, which gives them first dibs on lucrativecustomer business. They work to maintain visibility, and as long as theydo not lose money, they’re happy.\nThe main thing we can learn from institutional traders is their rigid\nsystem of discipline, with managers forcing them to cut losses. A pri-vate trader has no manager, which is why he needs to design andimplement a strict system of money management rules. Institutionaltraders benefit from focusing on a single market, unlike private traderswho may jump from cocoa today to IBM tomorrow. It pays to choosejust a few trading vehicles and learn them well.\nInstitutions are busy scalping, and a private trader is better off keep-\ning out of this area to avoid getting trampled. If you see a trade thatoffers only a few ticks, it is safer to pass it up because the institutionscan barge in at any moment. The longer your timeframe, the less com-petition you have from them.TRADING 141\nPrivate traders have one enormous advantage over institutions, but\nmost of them toss it away. Corporate traders must broadcast their bidand ask in order to maintain a presence in the markets. “How are youfor 5 dollar/yen,” calls a customer, wishing to trade $5 million for yenor vice versa. The bank trader must quote his bid and ask, ready totake either side of that trade. He must trade at all times, while a pri-vate trader has the luxury of waiting for the best moment.\nYou are under no obligation to buy or sell. You have the freedom\nof standing aside, but most private traders throw away this awesomeadvantage. People get sucked into the excitement of the game. Theyjump in instead of waiting for the best trades. Remember, the idea isto trade well, not to trade often.\nGetting the Data\nReal-time data tends to be pricey, and you must cover its cost beforetaking home a dime. Many exchanges make fortunes selling real-timedata, forcing vendors to delay free broadcasts to the public. The 20-minute delay preserves entertainment value, but trying to use that datafor day-trading is like driving a car with cardboard for a windshield,looking out through a side window. Day-trading is a very fast game,played by some very clever people. Trying to compete against them onthe basis of delayed data is a joke.\nMost day-traders use software to display, chart, and analyze their data.\nReal-time analytic software has been around for years, but the great NAS-DAQ bull market led to an upsurge in the popularity of Level 2 quotes,which show who is bidding and offering what stock. This is ballyhooedas the new road to riches. Most of those riches go to vendors and bro-kers who benefit from hyperactive trading. I haven’t noticed anyimprovement in the overall performance of private traders with Level 2quotes. The early users may have had an advantage a few years ago,when the concept was new, but once it became popular, the edge dis-appeared. This is a common story with new technologies—early usersget an edge, the tool becomes a fad, and the edge fades away.\nA day-trader needs a dedicated computer, good analytic software,\nand a fast connection to the Internet. This setup may cost several thou-sand dollars, plus a monthly bill of a few hundred dollars for live dataand exchange fees. You can reduce the cost of data by following justone market, which is not a bad idea because it helps keep you focused.142 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nSome professional futures traders dispense with computers alto-\ngether. They quit their day jobs and go on the floor. Some move to acity that has an exchange where they buy or lease a seat. Costs arehigher on bigger exchanges that handle high volumes in popular mar-kets, and cheaper on smaller exchanges in lesser markets. The bestway to learn is to get a job as a clerk on the floor and work for some-one, but this option is open only to the young—the floor generallydoesn’t hire people over 25. They want them young, pliable, and with-out any preconceived ideas.\nPsychology\nThe great paradox of day-trading is that it demands the highest level ofdiscipline, while attracting the most impulsive, addictive, and gambling-prone personalities. If trading is a thrill, then day-trading provides thebest rush. It is a joy to recognize a pattern on your screen, put in anorder, and watch the market explode in a stiff rise, stuffing thousandsof dollars into your pockets. A former military pilot said that day-trading was more exciting than sex or flying jet aircraft.\nCorporate traders are in the market because their companies gave\nthem jobs. Private traders enter for reasons that are partly rational andpartly irrational. The only rational reason is to make money, but a prof-itable day-trade delivers such a great high that it sweeps most peopleoff their feet. Flooded with pleasure, they go looking for the next highand lose money.\nThe purpose of any business is to make money. A well-run business\nalso gratifies many of its owners’ and employees’ psychological needs,but money is the pivot of the enterprise. Traders who become hookedon thrills take their eyes off the money and jump into impulsive trades.Vendors encourage day-traders because losers spend like drunkensailors on software, data, systems, and even coaches, most of whomhave never traded or busted out. Go into any port area, and you’llsee plenty of bars, brothels, and tattoo parlors. Go into day-trading,and you’ll see more vendors than you can shake a stick at. There is moneyto be made from turkeys whose market life is measured in monthsor weeks.\nSuccessful day-traders test patterns and systems, measure risks and\nrewards, and focus on building equity. Winners tend to be emotionallycool. If day-trading attracts you, you must answer several questions:TRADING 143\nAre you successfully trading with end-of-day charts? If the answer is\n“no,” stay away from day-trading. You need a minimum of oneyear successful trading experience before attempting to day-trade.\nDo you have an addictive streak? If you have a history of drinking,\ndrugs, overeating, or gambling, stay as far away as possible fromday-trading because it will trigger your addictive tendency anddestroy your account.\nDo you have a written business plan? How much money will you\ntrade? In what markets? How will you choose entries and exits?How will you manage risks, use stops, and allocate capital? Do\nnot go near day-trad ing without a written plan. Be sure to keep\nseparate records for day-trading and position trading. Find outwhich one is more profitable for you.\nChoosing the Market\nDay-trading compares to position trading like flying to driving.Comfortably seated behind the wheel of a car you can lean back,listen to music, use a cell phone, and even glance at a magazine whilestopped at a red light. Do not attempt that in a jet.\nDay-trading demands total concentration on a single market. It is\nlike serial monogamy—you may trade several markets in your career,but only one at any given time. What market will you choose? The twoessential features of a good day-trading market are high liquidity andvolatility.\nLiquidity refers to the average daily volume of your trading vehicle—\nthe higher, the better. It is easy to join a huge crowd and just as easyto leave without drawing attention to yourself and distorting the mar-ket with your order. When you place a market order to buy or sell athinly traded stock or a commodity, you give the pros a license to skinyou alive in slippage. If you use a limit order, it may never get filled.Trading a big liquid market, such as IBM or soybeans, allows you toget in and out more easily with less slippage.\nVolatility refers to the average daily range of your trading vehicle.\nThe greater the distance between the high and the low of the day, thebigger your target. Shooting at a big target is easier than shooting at atiny one. Remember our discussion of channels? If you know how totrade, you will get more money from a wide channel, at any level ofskill. Someone who trades at C level and takes 10% from a channel willget 1 point from a 10-point channel, but 2 points from a 20-point chan-144 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nnel. A C-level trader has no business day-trading, but even an A trader\nwants as big a target as possible.\nYou can find good liquidity and volatility in the leading stocks,\nfutures, and currencies. Another important feature of a day-tradingmarket is its personality. Some markets move smoothly, others like tojump. Bonds, for example, tend to spend a day or two in a very nar-row range, then explode, moving more in half an hour than in severalpreceding days, and then fall asleep again. Trading them is like infantryfighting—90% sheer boredom and 10% sheer terror.\nWhat markets should you day-trade? In stocks, look at those that\nshow up on the list of the most active issues of the day. That’s wherethe action is. These stocks’ liquidity is very high, and their volatility tendsto be good. Explore the list of top gainers and losers for the day. Whenthe same name shows up on that list day in and day out, it is clearlyamong the most volatile issues, with great day-trading potential.\nWhen it comes to futures, make your first steps in such relatively peace-\nful markets as corn, sugar, or copper. Once you’ve learned the ropes,consider moving up to stock index futures or the futures on the GermanBund, both among the favorite vehicles of professional day-traders.\nAnalysis and Decision Making\nIf you remove price and time markings from a chart, you won’t beable to tell whether it is weekly, daily, or intraday. Markets are fractal,to borrow a term from chaos theory. To recall our earlier discussion,the seashore is fractal, since the coastline looks equally jagged fromany height. Since charts in different timeframes are so alike, we mayanalyze them using similar methods.\nComing to day-trading after a year or more of successful position\ntrading gives you a great advantage. You can use the same methods,and only have to speed them up. You can use the principles of TripleScreen to make strategic decisions on longer-term charts and tacticalchoices on shorter-term charts.\nSCREEN ONE\nAnalyze your market on a longer-term chart, using trend-following indi-cators, and make a strategic decision to trade long, short, or stand aside.\nChoose the timeframe you prefer to trade and call it intermediate. Let\nus select a five-minute chart for our intermediate timeframe, with eachbar representing five minutes of trading. You can choose a longer chartTRADING 145\n146 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nA\nWed Thu Fri\nFigure 6.3 Day-Trading—25-Minute Chart\nIf we prefer a five-minute chart for day-trading, we should start our analy-\nsis with a timeframe that is five times longer, a 25-minute chart. Differentstocks go in and of out of favor with day-traders. Human GenomeSciences (HGSI) is popular today, with strong, healthy trends and nogaps. There is a downtrend on Monday, which bottoms out on Tuesday,turns up on Wednesday, and rises into Friday, with a pullback at the endof that day as longs take profits before the weekend.\nThere is a strong buy signal right at the opening on Wednesday as the\nEMA turns up, confirmed by the uptick of MACD-Histogram. As EMAkeeps rising, it tells us to trade HGSI from the long side; the firstscreen of T riple Screen is bullish. This signal is much more important than\nany uptick or downtick of MACD-Histogram. When MACD rises in gearwith the EMA, it suggests trading larger size, but when it declines, it is aperfectly normal “breathing” behavior, as long as there is no bearishdivergence.\nAt the right edge of the chart the market is closing for the weekend.\nThe EMA is slightly rising, so bulls have to be given the benefit of doubt.Also, MACD-Histogram has declined to the level normally associatedwith bottoms; it is closer to a bottom than to a top. We should wait for theopening on Monday, anticipating a buy signal, while being prepared totrade from the short side if the EMA ticks down.\nTRADING 147\nif you wish, but not much shorter, as that might pit you against insti-\ntutional scalpers. To stand completely apart from the crowd, you mayselect an unorthodox length, such as seven or nine minutes.\nSome day-traders, intoxicated by the promise of technology, use\none-minute or even tick charts. These provide the illusion that you arepresent on the floor, even though it can easily take half a minute orlonger for the data to be keyed in, uploaded to the satellite, and broad-cast to your screen. You are not on the floor, you are behind. Whenmarkets begin to run, time lags get even worse.\nMultiply your intermediate timeframe by five to find the long-term\ntimeframe. If your intermediate timeframe is five minutes, use a 25-\nminute chart. If your software does not allow plotting 25-minute charts,round it off to half an hour. A successful trader needs to stand apartfrom the crowd. This is why it pays to use uncommon parameters forcharts and indicators. There are probably thousands of people usinghalf-hourly charts, but only a tiny minority uses 25-minute charts andgets its signals a little faster.\nApply a trend-following indicator to the long-term chart and use its\ndirection to make a strategic decision to trade long, short, or stand aside.Start with a 20- or 30-bar EMA and adjust its length until it tracks yourmarket with a minimum of whipsaws. When the 25-minute EMA rises, itidentifies an uptrend and tells you to trade from the long side or stand\naside. When the EMA falls, it identifies a downtrend and tells you to\ntrade only from the short side or stand aside. Make a strategic decision onthis long-term chart before returning to your intermediate-term charts.\nSuccessful day-traders tend to rely less on indicators and more on\nchart patterns. The gaps between trading days can distort intraday indi-cators. Still, some indicators, such as moving averages and envelopes,also called channels, are useful even with intraday charts.\nSCREEN TWO\nReturn to the intermediate (five-minute) charts to look for entries in thedirection of the trend.\nPlot a 22-bar EMA on the five-minute chart and draw a channel\nthat contains about 95% of price action. Moving averages reflect the\naverage consensus of value, while channels show the normal limits ofbullishness and bearishness. We want to get long during uptrends, buy-ing below the EMA on a five-minute chart, and short in downtrends,above the EMA. Do not get long above the upper channel line, where\nthe market is overvalued, or sell short below the lower channel line,\nwhere it is undervalued.\nUse oscillators, such as MACD-Histogram and Force Index, to iden-\ntify overbought and oversold areas. Trade in the direction of the tide,\nentering when a wave goes against the tide. When the 25-minute trendis up, falling prices and oscillators on a five-minute chart reflect a tem-porary bearish imbalance—a buying opportunity. When the 25-minutetrend is down, rising prices and oscillators on a five-minute chart reflecta temporary bullish imbalance—a shorting opportunity.\nDay-traders sometimes ask whether they should analyze weekly and\ndaily charts. The weekly trend is essentially meaningless for them, andeven the daily is of limited value. Looking at too many timeframes canlead to “paralysis from analysis.”\nPlace SafeZone stops. After entering a trade, place a protective stop,\nusing the SafeZone method (see page 173). Consider making it “on close148 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThu FriAB C D E\nFigure 6.4 Day-Trading—Five-Minute Chart\nThe long-term 25-minute chart has told us to trade HGSI from the long\nside.

If\nthe 25-minute trend is up, buy pullbacks to the EMA on a five-minutechart, especially when oscillators are oversold. Reverse the procedurein downtrends.

It declines back to the EMA, giving ample opportunities to\nposition long, even if you missed the first signal. The MACD bottom inarea C is more shallow, showing that bears are weaker, reinforcing thebuy signal. Prices make four more attempts to reach the upper channelline. You can sell at any of them, but if you have not sold during the firstthree, the fourth is a must. It is getting late in the day, you already knowthat today prices do not seem to be able to reach their upper channelline, and as a day-trader you do not want to hold overnight. Sure enough,during the last half-hour there is a downdraft, as day-traders who over-stayed the uptrend start pushing through the door, trying to get out.\nOn Friday, there is a buy signal right at the opening, followed by a\nquick rally to the upper channel line for profit taking, and then anotherdecline to the EMA (point D). The subsequent rallies never quite reach theupper channel line, but there is another buying opportunity at point E,during a pullback to the EMA. There are two weak rallies later in the after-noon, and if you do not use them to take profits, there is one last ringfor the hard of hearing when the EMA turns down. Intraday charts oftenhave countertrend moves late in the day, as traders with paper profits startclosing positions.\nAt the right edge of the chart, the trading day and the trading week are\nover. You have no overnight risk and can relax before the opening onMonday, when the 25-minute MACD-Histogram will tell you whether totrade this stock from the long or the short side.\nminute oscillators, such as MACD-Histogram, are making new highs\nand related markets are rallying, you may wait for the channel to behit or penetrated. If the indicators are weak, grab your profit fast with-out waiting for prices to touch the channel.\nMeasure your performance as the percentage of the channel width.\nYou must be an A trader to make day-trading worthwhile. Even then,you have to prove to yourself that you can make more money day-trading than position trading. Try to trade only a few times a day andaim to catch at least a third of that day’s range. Enter cautiously, butrun fast. Do not trade during after-hours sessions when markets tendto be very thin.\nTaking Day-Trades Overnight\nIf you enter a trade early in the day and the market keeps moving inyour favor, should you hold that trade overnight? How about over theweekend? Of course, those questions only apply to profitable trades.Taking a loss overnight is strictly for losers.\nA beginner must close his day-trades by the end of the day, but an\nexperienced pro has the option of holding them overnight. When amarket closes within a few ticks of its high, it usually exceeds it thenext morning. A market that closes on its lows usually flirts with lowerlows the next day. Those extensions are not guaranteed, as the marketmay close on its high, get hit with bad news overnight, and opensharply lower. This is why only experienced day-traders have theoption of taking their trades overnight.\nResearch, knowledge, and discipline put your trades on a cooler,\nmore rational footing. You have to research the past, calculate theodds, and make informed decisions for the future. When you day-trade, there are plenty of hours when the market goes nowhere, leav-ing you free to crunch the numbers. You may use a single computeror get two machines and dedicate one to trading and another toresearch.\nGet one year’s history for the market you’re day-trading. Drop it into\na spreadsheet and start asking questions. Every time the market closedwithin 5 ticks of its high, how many times did it reach a new high thenext day? How far did it go the next day? What about the days whenthat market closed within 5 ticks of the lows? How low did it go thenext day? Once you get the answers, find out what happened whenthe market closed within 10 ticks of the high, and so on.150 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nProfessionals tend to trade the same market month after month,\neven though there is a huge turnover of amateurs. Professionals havegrown used to trading in a certain way, and to trade like them youmust find those patterns and express them in numbers. You must baseyour trades on facts and probabilities, not on gut feel and hope. Youmust do your own research. You cannot buy the answers, because onlyfinding them yourself will give you the confidence to trade.\nOpening Range Breakouts\nPeople get tips at parties, from the newspapers, and on TV, that glue-box of mass culture. Investment officers at slow-moving institutionsmay sit in a meeting all day before getting permission to buy or sell.They tend to place orders before the open. Most overnight orderscome from casual investors, gamblers chasing hot tips, and brokerswho want to leave work early to play golf or make marketing calls.\nThe two busiest times for professional traders are the beginning and\nthe end of each session, especially the first and last half-hour periods.The influx of overnight orders gives professionals an opportunity toperform a public service by accommodating those who are eager to getin at the opening. They unwind those positions near the close, whenone loser after another throws in the towel. Many pros go out for lunchin the middle of the day, which is why many markets tend to becomedirectionless and choppy between 12 and 1:30. The curve of intradayvolume tends to be U-shaped, with peaks at the open and the close,and a low in the middle.\nSerious traders watch openings because they set the tone for the bal-\nance of the day. If the total size of buy orders exceeds that of sell orders,the floor opens the market higher, forcing the crowd to pay up. Prosestablish short positions at such high levels that the very first drop makesthem money. If the volume of sell orders is higher, the pros open the mar-ket lower, load up on the cheap, and sell at a profit on the first bounce.\nDuring the first 15 to 30 minutes after the open many stocks and\nfutures swing up and down on high volume. As the bulk of overnightorders gets filled, volume starts to dry up, and the swings slow down,retreating from the high and the low of the opening range. What hap-pens next largely depends on the width of the opening range.\nWhen the opening range is very wide, say 80% of an average daily\nrange for the past month, it is likely to have set both the high and thelow for that day. The floor loves wide opening ranges because theirTRADING 151\n152 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAB\nCDEFGH\nFigure 6.5 Day-Trading—Opening Range Breakout\nElder-ray, 5-minute chart\nStocks for day-trading should have heavy volume, be volatile, and be\nexpensive rather than cheap, so that they have decent intraday ranges. Atthe time of this writing, Checkpoint is definitely on the list, along withNVDA, TARO, and a few other swingers. By the time you read this, otherstocks will be in the forefront of day-traders’ attention.\nCHKP has been rallying, coming off the market’s recent lows and clos-\ning at 39.44. Today it opens at 39.26 at 9:30 (point A) and within 10 min-utes runs up to 40.25 (point B), establishing the high of the openingrange. It then drifts lower, hitting the low of 38.93 at 10:10 \nA.M.—the low\nof the opening range (point C). For the next hour and a half CHKP mean-ders within its fairly narrow opening range of only 1.32, but by 11:35 it runsup to its upper edge and penetrates it by 3 ticks (point D). The next bar is7 ticks higher—this is no false breakout, this is a real opening range break-out, the trend is up, and we have to get long. The 13-bar EMA is steadilyrising. Whenever Bear Power returns to the zero line and turns nega-tive, it shows that bears have regained their footing—a good time to addto longs within an uptrend (points E, F, G, and H). At 15:25 (point I) the EMAturns down, giving a sell signal—time to take profits on long positions.\nAt the right edge of the chart, the day is over, and we may count prof-\nits before going home. If you bought on the first buy signal following theopening range breakout and sold when the EMA turned down, your profitis 42.15 −40.40 =1.75. Multiply this by the number of shares you traded,\nand add other positions if you pyramided.\nTRADING 153\nextremes provide two good levels of support and resistance. The pros\nkeep buying near the lows, shorting near the highs, and spending therest of the day unwinding their positions at a profit. A narrow openingrange makes it more likely that the market will break out of it and starta new trend for the day.\nThe high and the low of an opening range are like the feet of a\nboxer. When they are wide apart, the boxer is stable and in control,but when they are close, it is easy to knock him off balance and forcehim to move.\nOutsiders love trends and chase breakouts, but the floor operates in\na reactive mode, selling the highs and buying the lows. It prefers flattrading ranges to runaway trends. The floor usually wins, but once ina while outsiders overwhelm the pros and push the market into atrend. When that happens, smart floor traders cut their losses and run,while the dumb and the stubborn contribute to the mortality rate.\nThe opening range has several implications for day-traders:\nThe opening and closing prices, like two poles of a magnet, tend to\nbe at the opposite extremes of a day’s bar. If the market opensnear the low of a wide opening range, expect it to close near theupper edge and look for buying opportunities. If it opens near thehigh of a wide opening range, expect it to close lower and lookfor shorting opportunities.\nBreakouts from wide opening ranges tend to be false. When prices\ntake out the high or the low of a wide opening range, be alert tothe possibility of the breakout petering out and be ready to tradeits return into the range.\nWhen the opening range is narrow, expect a breakout and be ready\nto trade in its direction.\nSuccessful traders test everything. There are hours in most days when\nthe market is undecided, neither a buy nor a sell. Use that time toresearch its opening ranges—how many minutes they take to form inyour stock or future, how wide they tend to be, and so on. Create agraph linking the height of the opening range with the likelihood ofa breakout, and you’ll acquire a private tool, a real edge in the markets.\nCurrencies—Trading the 24-hour Markets The United States is the\nonly country in the world where most people don’t think much aboutcurrencies. We live in the dollar universe, but the moment an American\nsets foot abroad, he realizes that everyone, from executives to taxi\ndrivers, watches exchange rates. When the people outside the UnitedStates, and even recent immigrants to the United States, get a bit oftrading capit al, their first idea is to trade currencies. The bulk of currency\ntrading takes place in the interbank market, directly between dealers.\nBeginners turn to unscrupulous currency trading shops that buckettheir orders (hold their money without executing trades) and kill themwith commissions, spreads, and interest charges. Survivors discovercurrency futures, where spreads are more narrow, commissions morereasonable, and no interest is charged for the privilege of holding aposition.\nAside from the horrors of forex shops, the biggest challenge of cur-\nrencies is that they trade around the clock. You may enter a trade, ana-lyze it in the evening, and decide to take profits the next day. Whenyou wake up, there is no profit to be taken. The turning point you sawcoming has already come and gone, not in the United States, but inAsia or Europe. Someone has picked your pocket while you slept!Markets are tough enough without exposing yourself to 24-hour risk.\nBig financial institutions deal with this problem by implementing a\nsystem of “passing the book.” A bank may open a position in Tokyo,manage it intraday, and then transfer it to its London branch beforeclosing for the night. London continues to trade that position and inthe evening passes the book to New York, which trades it until itpasses it back to Tokyo. Currencies follow the sun, and small traderscan’t keep up with it. I once visited a wealthy Thai gentleman who wasplanning to install his two sons and himself in three different citiesaround the globe to trade currencies, but the boys balked.\nIf you trade currencies, you should either take a very long-term view\nand ignore daily fluctuations, or else day-trade, avoiding overnightpositions. If you trade currency futures, use two sets of data. Use cashor interbank data for your weekly charts and futures data for the dailiesto pinpoint entries and exits. The daily charts of currency futures arefull of overnight gaps because those markets are open for only a fewhours a day, but the charts of cash are smooth.\nS&P 500—False Breakouts S&P futures are notoriously hard to trade,\nbut newcomers are drawn to them like moths to a flame. “Are you manenough to trade the S&P?!” is the battle cry of those overgrown boys.Most traders are woefully undercapitalized for this expensive contract.It is hard to see how anyone with less than a quarter million in his154 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\naccount could trade a single contract of this volatile market, which\noften jumps several points of $250 each within minutes.\nThe floor takes full advantage of the fact that most gamblers do not\nhave enough money to carry overnight positions, place sensible stops,or ride out small adverse moves. The floor has got the art of shak-ing out inexperienced day-traders down to a science. They use falsebreakouts to make losers jump like Pavlov’s dogs, buying high andselling low.\nThe floor tries to push prices through several well-known levels on\nmost days, flushing out weak holders. There is always a mass of sellstops below the low of the opening range and the low of the day.Shoving the market through those lows leads to selling by weak hold-ers, and the pros then buy their merchandise on sale. There is alwaysa mass of buy stops at the high of the opening range, the high of theday, and the high of the previous day, placed by weak shorts. Pushingthe S&P through those levels sets off panicky buying. That’s whenthe floor sells short, positioning itself for the next downswing. Thereis nothing uniquely devious about this game, only it works especiallywell in the S&P because there are so many amateurs and this marketis so expensive that they have no staying power.\nA day-trader who recognizes the special challenges of the S&P can\nreach several conclusions:\nThis is not a good market for beginners; it is too expensive and too\nfast. Learn to drive an old Chevy before a turbocharged Ferrari.\nHave a good-sized account if you plan to trade this market. A quar-\nter of a million dollars for each contract gives you staying powerand allows you to place sensible stops.\nFade false breakouts in the S&P—trade against them. Use oscillators\nto detect when a false breakout starts running out of steam, andtrade for the return into the middle of the day’s range.\nThe Daily Plan\nA day in front of a live screen includes many dead hours when nothingseems to happen. People grow bored and restless, and the next thingyou know, a day-trader turns his screen into an entertainment center.Professionals tend to follow a timetable to reinforce their discipline.\nYour trading day should start before the opening. Give yourself at\nleast half an hour to assemble and analyze overnight data. Watch thefirst half hour of trading with no interruptions, not even phone calls. IfTRADING 155\nyou put on a trade, then manage it. Otherwise dedicate two hours to\nresearch, database maintenance, reading a trading magazine or a book,\nor trolling the net for fresh ideas, all the while in front of the screen.Suspend everything if the market looks close to giving a buy or sellsignal. Have lunch at your desk if you are managing a trade. Reviewtrading-related posts on the net and put more time into research.Consider keeping exercise equipment in your trading room, such as astationary bicycle or a rowing machine. A healthy mind in a healthybody. As the closing approaches, the market again demands your undi-vided attention, especially if you are exiting a trade.\nThere are two reasons to have a daily plan. You need to make sure\nthat all the necessary work gets done, trades found, placed, exited,recorded, and research conducted. The other reason is to remind your-self that you are day-trading as a business and not for amusement andthat you are serious about success.\nRemember that your feelings, desires, and anxieties are part and\nparcel of the game. When feelings are unsettled, trading becomes aproblem. I had a client in the late 1990s who had achieved phenome-nal success day-trading just one stock, AOL. He looked at yesterday’sclosing price, checked the levels at which AOL traded in Europe, andreviewed any overnight news. When AOL shot out of the gate after theopen, he traded its first swing, and sometimes two or three more dur-ing the first 30 minutes or an hour. He grossed $5,000 almost dailywithin the first hour of trading, buying and selling 1,000 shares at aclip. Then he spent the rest of day pissing that money away and losing!\nWhen he came to consult me, it was obvious that his system worked\nwell only during the first hour. It tracked an overnight buildup of pres-sure, and once that pressure equalized, he had no edge. His systemwas fantastically effective—as long as he stopped trading an hour afterthe opening. But he could not stop!\nIt turned out that his self-esteem was largely based on trying to win\nhis old father’s respect. The father was an immigrant who built a suc-cessful business by the dint of hard work, and he only respected menwho worked hard and put in long hours. My client felt that he hadto keep on “working” in the markets all day rather than turn off hiscomputer and go outside to play golf, drive his boat, or putter in thegarden. He did not want psychotherapy. I tried calling him at 10:30to remind him to stop trading, but then he got caller ID to avoid mycalls. A great system is only half the game; the other is trading psy-chology. The only goal of successful traders is to grow equity. Every-156 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nthing else, in cluding love, respect, and so forth, has to be gained outside\nthe markets.\nTHEIMPULSE SYSTEM\nHigh volatility during the bull market of the 1990s made momentumtrading very popular. The idea is to jump aboard a fast-moving stockas it begins to run and hop off after it slows down. Momentum tradersdo not care about company fundamentals; they may not even knowwhat that company does. All they care about is direction and speed.They buy when a stock rallies (they rarely go short) and hope to cashout before the impulse runs out.\nThe game of momentum trading appears deceptively easy. The\nowners of trading rooms make fortunes in commissions, while legions\nof traders lose even bigger fortunes trying to grab money from fast-\nmoving stocks. Impulse trading tends to degenerate into impulsivetrading, and the game is over.\nMomentum trading has a built-in psychological contradiction that’s\ndeadly to most people. On the one hand, this fast game, like infantryfighting or video game playing, is best suited for young people withstrong hunting instincts, capable of abandoning themselves to the game.On the other hand, momentum trading requires the cold detached disci-pline of a professional card counter in a casino. Successful momentumtrading, like professional gambling, is a boring business. The ability toaccept small steady gains—essential for momentum trading—is very rare.Few people can walk away from the table just as the party gets going.\nOne of my favorite clients is a professional trader in London who\nsometimes, for entertainment, goes to a casino at night. He playsblackjack for a minimum stake of £5 and quits when he is either £200ahead or £400 behind. He has worked out a card-counting methodand a money management system that have him going home with £20013 times out of 14. He has proven to himself that he can steadily winat the casino, and now he rarely goes there because he must spend6 or 7 hours counting and betting before reaching his winning or los-ing limit. It is hard work, counting all the time. The crowd of amateursaround him is having a lot of fun losing. My client prefers to stay homeand trade stocks where the odds are much more to his liking.\nSuccessful momentum trading requires great discipline. You must\nidentify a price move, hop aboard without waiting for a better confir-mation, and jump off as soon as that move slows down. The longerTRADING 157\nyou wait to identify the momentum, the less money is left for you.\nTaking profits is stressful because of a normal human tendency to holdout for a little more and then beat yourself up for having left too early.A momentum trader needs a set of technical rules, a money manage-ment system, and iron discipline to enter when the time is right andexit without regrets after hitting his profit target or a loss limit.\nEntries\nI designed this system to identify the inflection points where a trendspeeds up or slows down. The Impulse System works in any timeframe,including intraday. It provides buy and sell signals, but leaves it up toyou to select good markets, tweak parameters, and supply the discipline.\nChoose an active market whose prices swing in a broad channel.\nWhat happens if you make a C trade and grab only 10% of a channelwidth? This result is not too bad if the channel is 20 points wide, buta C trade is an exercise in futility if the channel is only 5 points wide.Chase fat rabbits, don’t waste your time on skinny ones.\nThe Impulse System combines two simple but powerful indicators.\nOne measures market inertia, the other its momentum. When bothpoint in the same direction, they identify an impulse worth following.We get an entry signal when both indicators get in gear, but as soon asthey stop confirming one another, we take that as an exit signal.\nThe Impulse System uses an exponential moving average to find\nuptrends and downtrends. When the EMA rises, it shows that inertiafavors the bulls. When EMA falls, inertia works for the bears. The sec-ond component is MACD-Histogram, an oscillator whose slope reflectschanges of power among bulls or bears. When MACD-Histogram rises,it shows that bulls are becoming stronger. When it falls, it shows thatbears are growing stronger.\nThe Impulse System flags those bars where both the inertia and the\nmomentum point in the same direction. When both the EMA andMACD-Histogram rise, they show that bulls are roaring and the uptrendis accelerating. When both indicators fall together, they show that bearsare crushing the market. Those indicators may stay in gear with eachother for only a few bars, but that’s when the market travels fast—theimpulse is on!\nBefore you rush to apply the Impulse System to your favorite mar-\nket, remember how Triple Screen analyzes markets in more than one158 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\ntimeframe. Select your favorite timeframe and call it intermediate.\nMultiply it by five to define your long-term timeframe. If your favoritechart is daily, analyze the weekly chart to make a strategic decisionto be a bull or a bear. Use a 26-week EMA, the slope of weekly MACD-Histogram, or both, on the weekly chart.\nOnce you’ve defined the long-term trend, return to your daily chart\nand look for trades only in the direction of the weekly. The ImpulseSystem uses a 13-day EMA and a 12-26-9 MACD-Histogram. The EMA,tracking market inertia, is a little shorter than our usual 22 bars, mak-ing the system more sensitive.\nWhen the weekly trend is up, turn to the daily charts and wait for\nboth the 13-day EMA and MACD-Histogram to turn up. When bothinertia and momentum rise, you have a strong buy signal, telling youto get long and stay long until the buy signal disappears.\nWhen the weekly trend is down, turn to the daily charts and wait for\nboth the 13-day EMA and MACD-Histogram to turn down. They give youa signal to go short, but be ready to cover when that signal disappears.\nSome technical programs allow you to mark price bars with different\ncolors. Make them green when both the EMA and MACD-Histogramrise, and red when both indicators fall. Don’t mark the bars where theindicators point in the opposite directions. This lets you easily see sig-nals at a glance.\nProgramming differs for different software packages, but here’s how\nI programmed buy signals into Internet Trader Pro:\nAlertMarker (mov (c,13,e) > ref (mov (c,13,e), −1) and fml \n(“MACD-Histogram”) > ref (fml (“MACD-Histogram”), −1), Below)\nHere is the code for sell signals:\nAlertMarker (mov (c,13,e) < ref (mov (c,13,e), −1) and fml \n(“MACD-Histogram”) < ref (fml (“MACD-Histogram”), −1), Above)\nIf you know how to program, you can add more features to the sys-\ntem. You can make its EMA length variable and test different lengths,looking for those that work best in your market. You can programsound alarms for buy and sell signals and monitor a number of mar-kets without being glued to the screen. There is a fisherman on theesplanade near where I live who has several fishing poles, each witha little bell. Whenever a fish bites, a bells rings, the man puts his news-paper down and starts reeling it in.TRADING 159\n160 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAB\nFigure 6.6 The Impulse System\nWhen both EMA and MACD-Histogram point in the same direction,\nthey identify an accelerating market move. The best way to see Impulsesignals is to program buys and sells in different colors. Trade in thedirection of an impulse to catch the sharpest, most dynamic moves.Also, never, ever trade against the Impulse. For example, a bullish diver-gence, a double bottom, and a kangaroo tail in March and April allpoint to an important bottom, but you may not buy as long as Impulseis down. The sell signal disappears at point A, and that’s when you maygo long.\nThe Impulse System beautifully tracks the bear move in January-March\nand the bull move in April–May. In May, bearish divergence B is followedby the disappearance of an Impulse buy signal, which permits shorting.The resulting downtrend is not as dynamic as the two preceding moves,with alternating Impulse buy and sell signals. It is a sign of an indecisivemarket, which is hard to trade. If in doubt, stay out.\nAt the right edge of the chart, a triple bullish divergence of MACD-\nHistogram gives a buy signal. The Impulse System has just gone off itssell signal. The stock market appears poised for a rally. If you buy, witha stop below the latest low, make sure that order is stop-and-reverse. Ifthis bullish divergence gets aborted, the market will give a Hound of theBaskervilles signal and fall out of bed.\nTRADING 161\nExits\nWhen a cowboy at a rodeo hops on the back of a wild bronco, how\nlong does he ride it? Twenty seconds, 35 maybe, 50 if he is good andlucky. Wild momentum trades don’t last long either. Try to hop off whileyou’re still in the money.\nThe time to buy into a momentum trade is when all your ducks are\nin a row, that is, when the weekly trend is up and the daily EMA andMACD-Histogram are rising. Hop off as soon as a single indicatorturns down. Usually, daily MACD-Histogram turns first as the upsidemomentum starts weakening. When the buy signal disappears, sellwithout waiting for a sell signal.\nReverse the procedure in downtrends. A momentum trade on the\nshort side starts when the weekly trend turns down and the daily EMAand MACD-Histogram also fall, showing that the downward momen-tum is accelerating. Cover shorts as soon as one of those indicatorsstops giving a sell signal. The most dynamic part of the decline is over,and your momentum trade has fulfilled its goal.\nThe Impulse System encourages you to enter cautiously but exit fast.\nThis is the professional approach to trading, the total opposite of theamateurs’ style. Beginners jump into trades without thinking too muchand take forever to get out, hoping and waiting for the market to turntheir way.\nThe Impulse System, like Triple Screen, is a method of trading rather\nthan a mechanical system. It identifies islands of order in the oceanof market chaos by showing when the crowd, usually so aimless anddisorganized, becomes emotional and starts to run. You get in when itspattern emerges and hop off when it starts to sink back into chaos.\nTest the Impulse System on your own market data to answer several\nimportant questions. Should you enter and exit at the open, after see-ing the signal in the evening, or should you try to anticipate those sig-nals? What if you do your homework 15 minutes before the close andbuy or sell without waiting for tomorrow? Experiment with several dif-ferent parameters of the EMA and MACD-Histogram.\nYou must be very disciplined to trade this system because it is hard\nto place an order when the market is already flying, but even harderto quit while you’re ahead without waiting for a reversal. You are notallowed to kick yourself if the trend continues after you get out. Donot touch this system if you have the slightest problem with discipline.\nThe Impulse System can help you trade other systems. Check its\nmessage when Triple Screen gives you a signal to buy. If the ImpulseSystem flashes a sell signal, hold off buying; do not trade against it. Youwant to buy a dip, not a waterfall decline. Reverse the procedure indowntrends. Hold off shorting if the Impulse System flashes a buysignal. Such “negative rules,” designed to keep you out of trouble, areamong the most useful for serious traders.\nMARKET THERMOMETER\nA beginner needs to learn a battery of standard technical indicators andstart tweaking their parameters. Some traders create their own indica-tors to gauge different aspects of crowd behavior and identify marketmoves. Let us walk through the process of creating a new technical indi-cator and see how to go about building your own private indicators.\nAll good indicators reflect some aspect of market reality. Market\nThermometer helps differentiate between sleepy, quiet periods and hotepisodes when market crowds become excited. It can help you adaptyour trading to the current environment.\nQuiet markets typically have narrow bars that tend to overlap one\nanother. Hot, boiling markets tend to have wide bars whose highs andlows extend far outside the previous day’s range. Beginners jump intotrades during those wide bars, afraid to miss a runaway move. If youenter when the markets are quiet, your slippage is likely to be lower.Hot markets are good for taking profits because then slippage maywork in your favor.\nWhen gold recently ran up $40 in one week, a journalist asked a\nfamous investor whether it was a good buy. Gold was good, he said,but the time to get on this bus was when it stood in front of the sta-tion, and not rolling down the highway at 40 miles an hour. MarketThermometer helps you recognize when the bus slows down in frontof the station, picks up speed, or roars down the highway.\nMarket Thermometer measures how far the most extreme point of\ntoday, either high or low, protrudes outside of yesterday’s range. Thegreater the extension of today’s bar outside of yesterday’s, the higherthe market temperature. Here’s the formula of Market Thermometer:\nTemperature =the greater of either (High\ntoday−Highyesterday)\nor (Lowyesterday−Lowtoday)162 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTo program Market Thermometer into Windows on WallStreet soft-\nware, use the following formula:\nif (hi <ref(hi, −1) and lo >ref(lo, −1), 0, if ((hi −ref(hi, −1))>\n(ref(lo, −1)−lo), hi −ref(hi, −1), ref(lo, −1)−lo)).\nIt is easy to adapt this formula to other software packages.\nMarket temperature is always a positive number, reflecting the ab-\nsolute value of either the upward or the downward extension of yes-terday’s range, whichever is greater. Plot temperature as a histogram\nabove zero. Calculate a moving average of market temperature, and\nplot it as a line on the same chart. I use a 22-day EMA because thereare 22 trading days in a month, but feel free to experiment with shorterEMA values if you want to make this indicator more sensitive to short-term swings.\nWhen markets are quiet, the adjacent bars tend to overlap. The con-\nsensus of value is well established, and the crowd does little buyingor selling outside of yesterday’s range. When highs and lows exceedtheir previous day’s values, they do so only by small margins. MarketThermometer falls and its EMA slants down, indicating a sleepy market.\nWhen a market begins to run, either up or down, its daily bars start\npushing outside of the previous ranges. The histogram of Market Ther-mometer grows taller and crosses above its EMA, which soon turns up,confirming the new trend.\nMarket Thermometer gives four trading signals, based on the rela-\ntionship between its histogram and its moving average:\nThe best time to enter new positions is when Market Thermometer\nfalls below its moving average. When Market Thermometer falls below\nits EMA, it indicates that the market is quiet. If your system flashes anentry signal, try to enter when the market is cooler than usual. WhenMarket Thermometer rises above its moving average, it warns that themarket is hot and slippage more likely.\nExit positions when Market Thermometer rises to triple the height\nof its moving average. A spike of Market Thermometer indicates a\nrunaway move. When the crowd feels jarred by a sudden piece ofnews and surges, it is a good time to take profits. Panics tend to beshort-lived, of fering a brief opportunity to cash in. If the EMA of\nMarket Thermo meter stands at 5 cents, but the Thermometer itself\nshoots up to 15 cents, take profits. Test these values for the marketyou are trading.TRADING 163\nGet ready for an explosive move if the Thermometer stays below its\nmoving average for five to seven trading days. Quiet markets put ama-\nteurs to sleep. They become careless and stop watching prices. Volatilityand volume fall, and professionals get a chance to run away with themarket. Explosive moves often erupt from periods of inactivity.\nMarket Thermometer can help you set a profit target for the next\ntrading day. If you are a short-term trader and are long, add the value\nof today’s Thermometer EMA to yesterday’s high and place a sell orderthere. If you are short, subtract the value of the Thermometer’s EMAfrom yesterday’s low and place an order to cover at that level.\nI had two purposes in presenting the Market Thermometer. I wanted\nto give you a new indicator, but even more I wanted to show you howto use your understanding of the markets to design your own analytictools. Once you understand the principles of market analysis, you cancreate your own indicators. Use your knowledge, understanding, anddiscipline to get on the right side of the markets.164 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAC D F G\nBE\nFigure 6.7 Market Thermometer\nNvidia Corp (NVDA) is one of the current favorites among active traders.\nJust look at its many tradable features—a powerful rally to 100, its tripletop, a MACD bearish divergence, and a subsequent downtrend. Marketsoscillate between quiet and active periods, and the Thermometer helpsyou identify them.TEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nEXITING TRADES\nWhenever you enter a trade, three factors must be crystal clear in your\nmind—where to get in, where to take profits, and where to bail out incase of an emergency. Daydreaming about profits will not make yourich. You must decide in advance where you’ll take your winnings offthe table or cut and run if the market turns against you.\nBeginners keep looking for promising trades and assume that find-\ning them will make them money. They search for entries, while pro-fessionals spend a lot of time and energy planning their exits. Theyalways ask themselves where to take profits or cut losses. Survivorsknow the essential truth—you don’t get paid for entering trades, youget paid for exiting them.\nWhy think about an exit before you enter a trade? Isn’t it better to get\nin, monitor the trade, and exit in response to price action? There are twomain arguments for deciding on an exit before you enter a trade.TRADING 165\nAt point A, the stock is in an uptrend, while the Thermometer has been\nbelow its 22-day EMA for five days. This is a quiet before the storm. Anexplosive move in the direction of the trend (point B) rewards buyers. At thesame time a very high Thermometer reading, three times above the average,warns that the fun and games are over; the move is exhausted, and it is timeto take profits. At point C the Thermometer shrinks again, spending five daysbelow its EMA and warning that a sharp move is coming. Since prices areabove their EMA, expect a decline. A similar message emerges at point D.After the next rally (point E), an extremely high reading of the Thermometer,more than four times the average, warns that it is a good time to take short-term profits. Prices make a triple top near 100, MACD-Histogram traces asevere bearish divergence, and at points F and G prices hang flat. This isanother quiet before the storm as bears swing the stock down.\nThe EMA of the Thermometer tells you how far today’s high or low is\nlikely to be above or below yesterday’s extreme. This is a useful piece ofintelligence for those who like to buy low or sell high; you can place yourorder for the day near the projected extreme.\nAt the right edge of the chart, prices have just shot up to their declin-\ning EMA. They deserved a rally after sliding from 100 to below 70, but avery high reading of the Thermometer, three times above average, indi-cates that the excitement is overdone, a pause is coming, and the down-trend is about to resume.\nFirst, knowing your targets and stops allows you to weigh rewards\nand risks. If you have a clear signal to buy, with a price target of $2above and a stop $4 below, is that trade worth taking? Do you wantto risk $4 to gain $2? Price targets and stops prompt you to focus onlyon trades whose potential rewards far outweigh the risks. The ability towalkaway from a potential trade is as important as the ability to decline\na drink when you want.\nSecond, setting profit targets and stops before entering trades helps\nsidestep the pernicious “ownership effect.” We get attached to thingswe own and lose objectivity. That old ratty jacket hanging in yourcloset should have been given to the Salvation Army years ago. Thattrade you entered last week is starting to come apart at the seams. Whydon’t you chuck it? You own both the jacket and the trade; they feelcomfortable, familiar. That’s why you need to decide on exits beforeyou enter, before a trade becomes yours.\nA friend who is a top-notch technical analyst temporarily took a job\nas a broker after falling on hard times when his hedge fund closed.Naturally, I moved one of my accounts to him. Whenever I called toplace an order, he would not let me hang up unless I gave him a stop.Sometimes I’d plead for a little more time and he’d take my order, onthe condition that I call back within five minutes to give him a stop, orelse he would call me. Six months later he found work as a technicalanalyst, and I have never seen another broker like him since. He reallystressed the need to know your safety parameters before you took onmarket risk.\nBefore entering a trade, you should set two specific price levels, a\ntarget and a stop, one above and the other below current prices. Thisis all you need for a short-term trade, where you shoot at a clearly vis-ible target. You may find a broker who accepts OCO (one cancelsother) orders. Then, if your profit target is hit, the stop is automaticallycancelled, and vice versa. If your broker does not accept OCO orders,give him your stop and keep an eye on your profit target.\nWhat if you’re planning a fairly long-term trade that may last for sev-\neral days or even weeks? Profit targets shift with the passage of time,and protective stops need to be tightened as the trade moves in yourfavor. You must write down your rules for exiting trades and followthem from that piece of paper without arguing, haggling, or hoping fora better price. For example, you may decide to exit if the upper chan-nel line gets hit or if the market makes lower lows for two days in a166 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nrow. Whatever rules you use, write them down and execute immedi-\nately once the market hits a profit target or a stop-loss level in accor-dance with your rules.\nVery experienced traders know how to recognize unusually forceful\ntrends, during which they shift exit strategies, take partial profits, andcarry the balance of their positions with a modified exit strategy forrunaway trends. As you become more experienced, you can become alittle more relaxed with your plans, but a beginning or an intermediatetrader must be very strict. Entries are easy because any clown can buya lottery ticket, but exits separate winners from losers.\nChannel Targets\nTraders all over the world squint at their charts, trying to recognize pat-terns, and let their imaginations run wild. Statistical studies, however,consistently confirm only one pattern—the tendency of prices to fluctu-ate above and below value. Markets may be chaotic most of the time,but their overbought and oversold conditions create islands of order thatprovide some of the best trading opportunities. Markets swing betweenelation and despair, and we can make money from those moods.\nChannels are technical tools that help us take advantage of market\nswings. We draw them parallel to the moving average in the inter-mediate timeframe, usually daily. A well-drawn channel contains ap-proximately 95% of recent prices. Its upper line represents the manicand the lower line the depressive moods of the market.\nIf we buy value near a rising moving average, we can sell mania in\nthe vicinity of the upper channel line. If we go short near a falling mov-ing average, we can cover at the depressed level near the lower chan-nel line. Channels provide attractive targets for profit taking.\nPeople say that a neurotic is a person who builds castles in the\nclouds, a psychotic lives in them, and a psychiatrist is the fellow whocollects the rent. Channels help us collect rent from what drives mostinvestors crazy—the relentless swings of the markets. The idea is to buynormalcy and sell mania or go short normalcy and cover depression.\nStraight channels or envelopes work better for profit taking than\nstandard deviation channels, or Bollinger bands. Those bands grow widewhen volatility rises and narrow when it declines. They help optionstraders, who depend heavily on volatility, but those of us who tradestocks or futures are better off with straight channels.TRADING 167\nChannels are for traders, not investors. If you want to invest in a $10\nstock and ride it to $50, channels are not for you. Exits from invest-ments or very long-term trades are based on the fundamentals or suchlong-term technical signals as the reversals of a 26-week moving aver-age. Envelopes or channels work best when you trade relatively short-term swings between undervalued and overvalued levels.\nIf you buy near a rising EMA, place a sell order where you expect\nthe upper channel line to be tomorrow. If the upper channel line hasbeen rising a half a point a day for the past few days and closed at 88today, then you can place a sell order at 88.50 for tomorrow. Adjustthis number every day as the channel moves higher or lower.\nWhenever I teach a group how to use channels for profit taking,\nsomeone raises a hand and points to an area where prices overshottheir channel. Taking profits at that channel line would have caused usto miss a large part of a rally. What can I say? This system is good butnot perfect. No method, except for hindsight, nails down all tops andbottoms. Robert Prechter, who used to be a famous market analyst, putit well when he said, “Traders take a good system and destroy it by try-ing to make it into a perfect system.”\nIf a trend is very strong, you may want to ride swings a little farther.\nSell half of your position when prices hit the upper channel line, butuse your judgment to dance out of the second half. You may monitorintraday prices and sell on the first day when they do not make a newhigh. Use your judgment and skills, but do yourself a favor—give upthe idea of nailing tops. Greed is a very expensive emotion.\nIf a rally is weak, prices may begin to sink without reaching their upper\nchannel line. There is no law that says the market must become manicbefore returning to value. Force Index can help measure the strength ofa rally. When the two-day Force Index rises to a new high, it confirmsthe power of bulls and encourages you to hold until prices hit the upperchannel line. If the two-day Force Index traces a bearish divergence, itshows that the rally is weak and you better grab profits fast.\nAn A trader is someone who takes 30% or more out of a channel.\nThat is a little more than half the distance from the moving average tothe channel line. Even if you buy slightly above the moving averageand sell below its upper channel line, you can be an A trader and profithandsomely. Channels help catch normal tops and bottoms, and youcan become very rich by steadily raking in normal profits. Channelshelp set up realistic profit targets.168 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nProtective Stops\nAmateurs swing between fantasy and reality, making most decisions in\nthe realm of fantasy. They dream of profits and avoid unpleasantthoughts about possible losses. Since stops force us to focus on losses,most traders resist using them.\nA friend told me she needed no stops because she was an investor.\n“At what price did you buy that stock?” I asked. She had gotten in at 80and now it was at 85. “Would you still hold it if it fell back to 80?” Shesaid she would. “What about 75?” She said she would probably buy more.“What about 70?” She winced. “What about 55? Would you still want toown it?” No, no, she vigorously shook her head. “Well, then you needa stop somewhere above 55!”\nI recently had dinner with a lawyer who obtained inside information\nthat a certain penny-stock company was about to announce a strategicpartnership with a telecom giant. Questions of legality and moralityaside, he put most of his money into that stock at an average price of16.5 cents a share. Once the announcement came out, his stock ran upto $8, but by the time he told me his secret over a tray of sushi, it wasdown to $1.50. He had no stop. I asked him whether he would con-tinue to hold if his stock slid to 8 cents, half of what he paid. He wasshocked and promised to put in a stop at $1. Did he do it? Probablynot. It is easier to dream and close one’s eyes to reality.\nYou must put in a stop immediately after entering a trade and start\nmoving it in the direction of that trade as soon as it starts moving inyour favor. Stops are a one-way street. When long, you may raise, butnever lower them. When short, you may lower but never raise them.Only losers say, “I’ll give this trade a little more room.” You alreadygave it all the room it needed when you placed your stop! If a stockstarts moving against you, leave your stop alone! You were morerational at the time you placed it than you are today, with prices hov-ering and threatening to hit it.\nInvestors must reevaluate their stops once every few weeks, but\ntraders have a harder job. We must recalculate our stops every day andmove them often.\nA Deadly Delusion Many traders think they can stay out of trouble\nwithout using stops, thanks to their superior market analysis. Trading is\na high-wire act. You may walk that wire a hundred times without a safetyTRADING 169\nnet, but the very first fall can cripple you. You cannot afford to take that\nchance. No amount of brains will help you if you abandon stops.\nSeveral years ago I got a call from a world-famous developer of trad-\ning software. He invited me on a camping trip, and mentioned in pass-ing that he had developed a fantastic system for trading futures. It wasbased on computerized pattern recognition, backtested on 20 years ofdata with breathtaking results. He had no money to trade that system,having lost his capital on an earlier venture, but showed his discoveryto a group of money managers. They were so impressed they began toset up a hedge fund for him, and in the meantime gave him what theycalled a small account—$100,000.\nI flew across the country and spent the first evening admiring my\nfriend’s system. “Are you trading anything now?” The system had givenhim six signals: in soybeans, Swiss francs, pork bellies, and three othermarkets. He had entered trades in all six. “How much did you allocateto each?” He had divided his account into six parts, one for eachmarket. No reserves. Fully margined. “Where did you put your stops?”He told me in so many words that real men didn’t use stops.\nHe had mathematical proof that stops lowered profitability. Safety\nlay in trading unrelated markets. If one or two went against him, otherswould move in his favor. “What about a catastrophic event, with all mar-kets moving against you?” He assured me that was impossible becausehe traded unrelated markets, and there was no correlation between Swiss\nfrancs and pork bellies. Furthermore, his system had not a single wipe-out in 20 years of backtesting.\nI suggested we forget about camping and stay closer to the screen,\nsince his entire capital was at risk. My friend insisted he had total con-fidence in his system, and so we drove to the Sierra Nevada, some ofthe most breathtaking scenery in America. We had a grand time, andon the last day my son, who was about 8 at the time, hauled in a plas-tic pail full of gold nuggets. It was fool’s gold, of course, but to thisday I keep one of them on my desk as a paperweight, engraved “Allthat glitters is gold.”\nBy the time we returned to civilization the impossible had hap-\npened. All six markets went against my friend, nearly wiping out hisequity. The next morning we watched in horror as the markets openedone after another, continuing to go against him in huge gobs. I talkedhim into closing two out of six positions, but then it was time to driveto the airport.170 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nA few days later I called to thank my friend for the trip. His account\nwas wiped out, and he bitterly complained that his money men weren’tgentlemen; they weren’t returning his phone calls. I resisted thetemptation to say that if he lost $100,000 for me, I would not returnhis phone calls either.\nA trader who doesn’t use stops will eventually take the mother of all\nlosses. Spectacular disasters hit brilliant individuals who believe thattheir general sharpness and great systems override the need for stops.A careless trader can get away with no stops for a while, but if he tradeslong enough the market will kill him.\nNo amount of brains will save a trader who doesn’t use stops. A\nNobel Prize for research in the financial markets will not help him.Look at Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund owned andoperated by a clutch of certified geniuses, including a former Salomon\ndirector, a former Fed governor, and two Nobel Prize winners. Thosepeople were too bright to use stops. They came to the brink of failurein 1998 and didn’t bust out only because the US Federal Reservestepped in to arrange a bailout to avoid disrupting world markets.\nNo amount of intelligence, knowledge, or computer power will save\nyou from a disaster if you trade without stops. Stops are essential foryour survival and success.\nWhat about mental stops—deciding on your exit point and then\nwatching the market? If it violates that level, you exit your position, try-ing to get the best price. This is a common strategy among pros whohave a lot of experience and iron discipline. A beginner, on the otherhand, watches the market the way a rabbit watches a snake—frozen infear, unable to move. He must place actual stops.\nStops do not provide total protection because prices are not con-\ntinuous and can gap across the stop level. You can buy a stock at 40and place a protective stop at 37, but a bad earnings report or anannouncement can force that stock to open at 34 tomorrow, filling yourorder at a much worse level than expected. This is not an argumentagainst stops. An umbrella with holes is better than no umbrella at all.Also, money management rules provide an extra level of protection.\nStops in Two Dimensions Placing stops is one of the hardest chal-\nlenges in trading, more so than finding good trades. You want to placethem close enough to protect your capital but far enough to avoidbeing stopped out by meaningless noise. It is a delicate balancing act.TRADING 171\nMost trading books repeat the same advice: place a stop below the\nlatest low when long or above the latest high when short. This methodis so simple and common that tons of stops become bunched up atthe same obvious levels. Professionals are not blind; they look at chartsand know where those stops are. They gun for them, trying to triggerstops with false breakouts.\nWhen a stock hangs just above support, the inflow of fresh buy\norders dries up, and those with stops below support just suck air andwait. The pros sell short, giving that stock a bit of a push. It stumblesbelow support, setting off a flurry of sell stop orders. The pros whoshorted at a higher level begin to cover, buying on the cheap fromamateurs whose stops they hit. As soon as the decline slows down theyredouble their buying, and go long. The market rallies, and the proswho bought below support now sell into the rally. Most breakoutsfrom trading ranges are false breakouts—fishing expeditions by thepros gunning for stops at common levels. Once those stops are cleanedout, the market is ready to reverse. Most traders become so disgustedafter getting hit by several false breakouts that they give up using stops.That’s when a real reversal catches them. They end up losing money,with and without stops, and wash out of the markets.\nPlacing stops at obvious levels is not a good idea. You are better off\nplacing them a bit closer to protect capital or a bit farther to reduce therisk of getting hit. Try not to do what everybody else does. Be sure toplace your stop where you do not expect the market to go. If youexpect prices to fall to a certain level, why place a stop there? You’rebetter off closing your trade without waiting.\nThere are two inputs into placing stops: technical analysis and\nmoney management. You can combine them to find the right size foryour trade as well as the right place for your stop. The first step is todecide how many dollars you should risk on the trade you’re aboutto take. Later, in the section on money management, you’ll learn tolimit your risk on any trade to a tiny percentage of your account. Ifyou’re not fully confident, risk an even smaller percentage. Once youhave the dollar figure for your maximum risk, turn to technical ana-lysis to find where to place your stop. A stop based on technicalanalysis is almost always tighter, that is, closer to the market, thanthe money management stop. Your account is now starting to look likea submarine with a double hull—softer on the outside and harder onthe inside.172 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nYour money management stops belong in the market. They repre-\nsent your maximum allowable risk level, which you may not violateunder any circumstances. If your technical analysis stops are closer tothe market, you may hold them in your mind as you monitor pricesand are prepared to exit if those levels gets hit.\nHere, I want to share with you two advanced methods for placing\nstops. Try to program them into your software and test them on yourmarket data. Until now, I have never disclosed SafeZone to traders,except to small groups in Traders’ Camps, where I like to share mylatest research. It is my principle not to withhold information frommy books. I write as I trade and maintain my edge not by secrecy butby developing new methods.\nThe SafeZone Stop\nOnce in a trade, where should you put your stop? This is one of thehardest questions in technical analysis. After answering it, you’ll facean even harder one—when and where to move that stop with the pas-sage of time. Put a stop too close and it’ll get whacked by some mean-ingless intraday swing. Put it too far, and you’ll have very skimpyprotection.\nThe Parabolic System, described in Trading for a Living , tried to\ntackle this problem by moving stops closer to the market each day,accelerating whenever a stock or a commodity reached a new extreme.The trouble with Parabolic was that it kept moving even if the marketstayed flat and often got hit by meaningless noise.\nThe concept of signal and noise states that the trend is the signal and\nthe nontrending motion is the noise. A stock or a future may be in anuptrend or a downtrend, but the noise of its random chop can obscureits signal. Trading at the right edge is hard because the noise level is high.I developed SafeZone to trail prices with stops tight enough to protectcapital but remote enough to keep clear of most random fluctuations.\nEngineers design filters to suppress noise and allow the signal to come\nthrough. If the trend is the signal, then the countertrend motion is thenoise. When the trend is up, we can define noise as that part of eachday’s range that protrudes below the previous day’s low. When the trendis down, we can define noise as that part of each day’s range that pro-trudes above the previous day’s high. SafeZone measures market noiseand places stops at a multiple of noise level away from the market.TRADING 173\nWe may use the slope of a 22-day EMA to define the trend. You need\nto choose the length of the lookback period for measuring noise level.It has to be long enough to track recent behavior but short enough tobe relevant for current trading. A period of 10 to 20 days works well,or we can make our lookback period 100 days or so if we want to aver-age long-term market behavior.\nIf the trend is up, mark all downside penetrations during the look-\nback period, add their depths, and divide the sum by the number ofpenetrations. This gives you the Average Downside Penetration for theselected lookback period. It reflects the average level of noise in thecurrent uptrend. Placing your stop any closer would be self-defeating.We want to place our stops farther away from the market than theaverage level of noise. Multiply the Average Downside Penetration bya coefficient, starting with two, but experiment with higher numbers.Subtract the result from yesterday’s low, and place your stop there. Iftoday’s low is lower than yesterday’s, do not move your stop lower sincewe are only allowed to raise stops on long positions, not lower them.\nReverse these rules in downtrends. When a 22-day EMA identifies a\ndowntrend, count all the upside penetrations during the lookbackperiod and find the Average Upside Penetration. Multiply it by a co-efficient, starting with two. When you go short, place a stop twice theAverage Upside Penetration above the previous day’s high. Lower yourstop whenever the market makes a lower high, but never raise it.\nI anticipate that SafeZone will be programmed into many software\npackages, allowing traders to control both the lookback period and themultiplication factor. Until then, you will have to do your own pro-gramming or else track SafeZone manually (see Table 6.1). Be sure tocalculate it separately for uptrends and downtrends.\nHere are the rules for calculating SafeZone using an Excel spread-\nsheet. Once you understand how it works, try to program SafeZoneinto your technical analysis software and superimpose its signals on thechart. Compare the numbers from the spreadsheet and the trading soft-ware. They should be identical; otherwise, you have a programmingerror. Comparing results from two software packages helps overcomepesky programming problems.\nRules for Longs in Uptrends When the trend is up, we calculate\nSafeZone on the basis of the lows because their pattern determinesstop placement.174 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nABCDE FG HI J K LM N O PQ R\n1IBM For uptrends For downtrends\n2Date High Low Close Dn Sum Pen Dn Dn Short Pr otected Up Sum Pen Up Up Long Protected\nPen Y/N numb Avg Stop Pen Y/N numb avg Stop\n304/19 115.90 110.30 114.47\n404/20 116.40 113.75 114.83 0 0 0.5 1\n504/23 114.05 111.68 112.00 2.07 1 0 0\n604/24 114.75 112.28 112.67 0 0 0.7 1\n704/25 114.85 111.99 114.85 0.29 1 0.1 1\n804/26 116.70 113.68 113.74 0 0 1.85 1\n904/27 116.90 114.55 116.20 0 0 0.2 1\n10 04/30 118.05 114.72 115.14 0 0 1.15 1\n11 05/01 118.65 114.90 118.51 0 0 0.6 1\n12 05/02 118.95 113.74 115.40 1.16 1 0.3 1\n13 05/03 115.10 112.35 113.70 1.39 4.91 1 4 1.23 0 5.4 0 8 0.68\n14 05/04 115.86 111.20 115.86 1.15 6.06 1 5 1.21 109.90 0.76 5.66 1 8 0.71 116.45\n15 05/07 117.25 115.00 115.90 0 3.99 0 4 1.00 108.78 1.39 7.05 1 9 0.78 117.28\n16 05/08 117.75 115.50 117.70 0 3.99 0 4 1.00 113.01 113.01 0.5 6.85 1 9 0.76 118.82 116.45\n17 05/09 118.18 115.30 116.98 0.2 3.9 1 4 0.98 113.51 113.51 0.43 7.18 1 9 0.80 119.27 117.28\n18 05/10 118.90 115.20 115.20 0.1 4 1 5 0.80 113.35 113.51 0.72 6.05 1 9 0.67 119.78 118.82\n19 05/11 114.15 110.96 111.81 4.24 8.24 1 6 1.37 113.60 113.60 0 5.85 0 8 0.73 120.24 119.27\n20 05/14 113.18 111.00 112.56 0 8.24 0 6 1.37 108.21 113.60 0 4.7 0 7 0.67 115.61 115.61\n21 05/15 114.15 112.50 113.58 0 8.24 0 6 1.37 108.25 113.60 0.97 5.07 1 7 0.72 114.52 114.52\n22 05/16 115.80 112.20 115.80 0.3 7.38 1 6 1.23 109.75 109.75 1.65 6.42 1 7 0.92 115.60 114.52\n23 05/17 117.09 113.36 115.07 0 5.99 0 5 1.20 109.74 109.75 1.29 7.71 1 8 0.96 117.63 114.52\n24 05/18 117.68 114.90 117.44 0 4.84 0 4 1.21 110.96 110.96 0.59 7.54 1 8 0.94 119.02 115.60\n25 05/21 119.90 117.55 119.04 0 4.84 0 4 1.21 112.48 112.48 2.22 8.37 1 8 1.05 119.57 117.63\n26 05/22 119.70 117.05 118.01 0.5 5.34 1 5 1.07 115.13 115.13 0 7.87 0 7 1.12 121.99 119.02\n27 05/23 118.95 117.10 117.40 0 5.14 0 4 1.29 114.91 115.13 0 7.44 0 6 1.24 121.95 119.57Table 6.1 SafeZone Stops—Spreadsheet\n175\n1.Obtain at least a month of data for your stock or future in high-\nlow-close format, as shown in Table 6.1 (lows are in column Cwith the first record in row 3).\n2.Test whether today’s low is lower than yesterday’s.

Putting your stopcloser than the average level of noise means asking for trouble, and eventwice the average level is often too close. Once your system identifies anuptrend, SafeZone starts following prices, getting you out before the trendreverses. You can see that SafeZone stop was hit at points A, B, C, and D,catching the bulk of the uptrend and avoiding downdrafts.\nThe right edge of the chart illustrates why it is a good idea never to\nhold a stock below its SafeZone level. JEC is in a free fall, wiping out theprofits of a month in just two days—a trader using SafeZone cashed outearly in the decline.\nSafeZone offers an original approach to placing stops. It monitors\nchanges in prices and adapts stops to the current levels of activity. Itplaces stops at individually tailored distances rather than at obvioussupport and resistance levels.\nSafeZone works on the way down just as well as on the way up.\nHere we count each upside penetration of the previous day’s rangeduring a selected time window and average that data to find theAverage Upside Penetration. We multiply it by a coefficient, startingwith 3, and add that to the high of each bar.\nLike all systems and indicators in this book, SafeZone is not a mechan-\nical gadget to replace independent thought. You have to establish thelookback period, the window of time during which SafeZone is calcu-lated. Do not go back beyond the last important turning point. If themarket has reversed from down to up two weeks ago, then SafeZone forthe current long trades should not look back more than 10 trading days.TRADING 179\nA\nFigure 6.9 SafeZone Stops—Downtrend\nOnce your system identifies a downtrend, SafeZone helps you ride your\nshort position all the way down, covering before a rally starts eating intoyour profits. Notice how SafeZone rode the decline in FCEL, constantlylowering its stop, until taken out by a rally at point A.\nAt the right edge of the chart, the downtrend continues, with SafeZone\nprotecting a short position. It is safe to hold shorts with a close stop.\nAnother important decision is choosing the coefficient for the SafeZone\nstop. Usually, a coefficient between two and three provides a marginof safety, but you must research it on your own market data. Once youhave done your homework and tweaked this indicator, it will becomeyour own private tool in the battle for survival and success in the markets.You can add it to almost any trading system, including Triple Screen.\nThe Chandelier Exit\nWhen a trend speeds up, you may want to shift gears and ride itinstead of trading swings. Catching swings calls for tight stops, but alonger-term position demands more breathing room. The ChandelierExit is designed to protect such positions.\nWhen buyers place stops, they usually count back from the lows and\nput stops below recent important bottoms. When traders go short, theyusually count back from the highs and place stops above the recent peaks.The Chandelier Exit takes a different approach. When traders are long,it hangs their stops from the highest peak reached by that trend, like achandelier hangs from the tallest point in the room. As prices move up,the Chandelier Exit, suspended from the highest point of that trend, alsorises. It tracks volatility as well as prices, as its distance from the peakgrows with the rise in volatility. We will review Chandelier Exits for up-trends, but you may reverse these rules and apply them to downtrends.\nThere is no telling how high a trend may go, and a Chandelier will\nrise until prices peel off from the ceiling and hit that stop. This method,along with several others, was presented by Chuck LeBeau in ourTraders’ Camp in January 2000 in the Caribbean and again in March2001 in the Pacific.\nThe Chandelier Exit draws on the concept of Average True Range,\ndescribed by Welles Wilder in 1966. The True Range is the greatestof the three figures—the distance between today’s high and low, ortoday’s high and yesterday’s close, or today’s low and yesterday’sclose. The True Range reflects overnight volatility by comparing today’sand yesterday’s prices.\nThe True Range is included in many software packages. The Average\nTrue Range (ATR) is obtained by averaging True Range over a periodof time. How long a period? You can begin by looking back a month,but a modern computerized trader can easily test different lookbackperiods for Average True Range.180 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThe Chandelier Exit subtracts the Average True Range, multiplied by\na coefficient, from the highest point reached by the trend. Its formula is:\nChandelier =HP−coef •ATR\nwhere\nChandelier =the Chandelier Exit\nHP =the highest point for a selected number of days\ncoef =the coefficient, selected by the trader\nATR =Average True Range for a selected number of days\nIf an uptrend is boiling and daily ranges are wide, then stops fall a\nlittle farther away. If the uptrend is quiet and calm with more narrowranges, the stops inch a little closer.\nIn Windows on Wallstreet software, the formula for the Chandelier\nExit is:\nHhv(hi, 22) −3\n•ATR(22)\nHhv(hi, 22) is the highest high reached in the past 22 days and\nATR(22) is the Average True Range for the past 22 days. Try to test otherparameters in the markets you like to trade.\nThis formula multiplies the Average True Range by three before sub-\ntracting it from the high of the past 22 trading days. A serious trader ispassionate about his research. Such a person will immediately noticethat this formula contains three variables—the length of the lookbackperiod for the highest high, the length of the lookback period for theTrue Range, and the coefficient for multiplying Average True Range. Itprobably doesn’t pay to fiddle with the first variable, as the highesthigh in a runaway uptrend is likely to be close to the right edge andmost lookback periods catch it. The Average True Range is only slightlymore sensitive to the length of its lookback period. A more fertileground for experimenting is the ATR coefficient. If everyone has theirstops at 3 ATRs below the peak, wouldn’t you like to see what hap-pens if you set your stop at 3.5 or 2.5?\nThe Chandelier Exit can be used to trail profits on short positions in\nrunaway downtrends. There the formula becomes:\nLlv(lo, 22) +3\n•ATR(22)\nLlv(lo, 22) is the lowest low reached in the past 22 days and ATR(22)\nis the True Range for the past 22 days.TRADING 181\nExperienced traders sometimes joke that bear markets have no sup-\nport and bull markets no resistance. A runaway trend can overshoot allrational expectations. The Chandelier deals with that by tying its stopsto the price extreme as well as volatility.\nThe negative side of Chandelier Exits is that they give up a great deal\nof profit. Three Average True Ranges can amount to a lot of money ina volatile market. A beginning trader is better off taking his profits atthe channel wall. A more advanced trader whose market is hitting itschannel wall while showing great strength is more likely to switch toa Chandelier Exit. If he holds a large position, he may take partial prof-its at the channel wall and carry the rest using the Chandelier. TheChandelier Exit may act a backup exit strategy for experienced traders.\nGamblers lose fortunes trying to nail tops and bottoms. A good trader\nis a realist who wants to grab a chunk from the body of a trend, leaving182 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nABC\nFigure 6.10 The Chandelier Exit\nIn an uptrend, the Chandelier Exit hangs from its uppermost point, 3\nAverage True Ranges below the extreme. It does a good job of helpingcatch the bulk of the uptrend, stopping traders out and protecting profitsat points A, B, and C. Notice that as volatility increases the Chandeliergives a stock a little wider stop, receding from prices.\nAt the right edge of the chart, the Chandelier Exit has taken profits just\nas the decline got under way. Wait until your system gives you a new buysignal, and when it does, hang a new Chandelier on that trend.\ntop- and bottom-fishing to people on an ego trip. The Chandelier Exit\nhelps take care of that chunk.\nCHOOSING WHAT TO TRADE\nOpen a newspaper, and thousands of listings leap at you from thepages—stocks, mutual funds, futures, options, bonds, currencies. Yourdata provider may offer a menu of 20,000 items or more. Were you todownload and review all of them, spending just two seconds on each,that process would take 11 hours.\nBeginners worry about missing opportunities and try to look at as\nmany markets as possible. They often ask for advice on scanning soft-ware. They want to sift through thousands of stocks for somethinglike a bullish divergence in MACD-Histogram. First of all, divergences,so visible to the naked eye, are notoriously hard to program. The bestprogrammer I know tells me he’s done it—it is the pinnacle of hissuccess—using the most expensive software. Even if a beginner couldget hold of his program, that expense would be wasted because hewouldn’t know what to do with the stocks he found in that search.He wouldn’t know how to trade them correctly. A beginner is betteroff focusing on a handful of markets, learning all about them, and trad-ing them with care and attention.\nYou are better off limiting yourself to as many markets as you can\nrealistically follow each day. Professionals study their markets daily todetect transitions from sleepy trading ranges to new trends. The besttime to profit from a trend is before it becomes overpriced and volatile.\nMarkets that make headlines tend to be overpriced and volatile. If\nyou read an article on the front page of a financial newspaper abouta bull market in biotech stocks or see a report on the evening newsabout the high price of coffee, those trends are probably nearer theend than the beginning, and buying biotech stocks or coffee futures isprobably very dangerous.\nTo understand a person or a group, it pays to know what they want\nand what they fear. Journalists and editors most fear making a mistakethat will make them look foolish. They report trends only after anyonecan see them because that way there is no mistake. Even if they knewhow to catch trends early, which they don’t, they wouldn’t dare printtheir findings for fear of being wrong and appearing ignorant. Tradersaren’t afraid of mistakes as long as they use money management, butjournalists cannot afford such risks. By the time they write up a trend,TRADING 183\nit has been going on for a while, volatility is high, risk management is\ndifficult, and a major reversal is probably in the cards.\nShould you trade stocks or futures, currencies or options? Options\nare rough for beginners, who should learn to trade the underlying secu-rities first, whether stocks or futures. People outside the United Statesare often drawn to currencies, forgetting that those are truly globalmarkets, and when you trade them, you go against banks that havetraders in all time zones. The choice between stocks or futures is sel-dom made on a rational basis. Trading stocks seems more respectable,while futures have more of a swashbuckling reputation. Futures gettheir wild image from their enormous leverage. If you scrupulouslyobserve money management rules, they become much safer and lessnerve-racking.\nStocks\nStocks tend to move more slowly than futures, thus reducing risks forbeginners, especially those who avoid margin. It is one of the mysteriesof markets that cash traders are more likely to win, and margin tradersto lose. Why? Interest rates on margin loans are a serious expense, rais-ing a barrier to winning, but there’s more. People who buy stocks forcash tend to feel more relaxed, buying as much or as little as theywant. Margin traders are more likely to feel stressed. An anxious traderis a troubled trader. It is better to buy only what you can afford, pol-ish your skills, and the money will follow.\nThe sheer number of stocks drives people to distraction. Beginners\nthrow their arms in the air and beg for a list of stocks to follow. A dis-ciplined trader makes several choices that help him concentrate. Hebegins by selecting an industry group or groups and then zeros in onindividual stocks.\nA beginner should start with one or two groups, an intermediate\ntrader can go up to four or five, and an expert knows how many hecan handle. Chances are, he sticks to the few groups he knows well.Begin by choosing a group that you think has a great future or one inwhich you have a personal interest. For example, you may decide toconcentrate on biotechnology because of its promise or the hospitalityindustry because that’s where you work.\nSelect a broad rather than a narrow group. For example, if you\ndecide to track autos, look not just at car manufacturers, but also atcompanies that make auto parts, tires, etc. The disadvantage of focusing184 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\non a single group is that you miss spectacular moves in others, but\nthere are several advantages. You learn which stocks tend to lead orfollow. When leaders start to move, they give you an advance signalto trade the laggards. You can use relative strength, that is, buy thestrongest stocks when the group moves up and short the weakest onthe way down. You can create an index that includes all the stocks youfollow in your industry group, and then analyze that index. This ana-lytic tool is not available to any other trader. If you use fundamentalanalysis, then having your finger on the pulse of a single industry, suchas software, puts you miles ahead of competitors who trade Microsofttoday and McDonald’s tomorrow.\nA broadly defined industry group may include over a hundred stocks,\nbut an intelligent beginner should not follow more than a dozen. Wecan divide all stocks into blue chips and speculative “cats and dogs.”Blue chips are the stocks of large, well-established companies, held bymany institutions and followed by many researchers. They have a fairlywell-established consensus of value around which they more or less\ngently oscillate. If you design a system for catching their sw ings\nseveral times each year, the potential gains can be very attractive. Don’tignore the big Dow-type stocks. Their orderly swings from the movingaverage to the channel wall create good trading opportunities.\nThe so-called cats and dogs may spend months, if not years, flat at the\nbottom, in a speculative doghouse, until a fundamental change, or evena rumor of change, propels them to a breakout and a new uptrend.Other cats and dogs may go nowhere or expire. Those stocks offer muchhigher percentage gains than blue chips, but the risks are greater andyou must spend a great deal of time waiting for them to move. It makessense to trade a large portion of your account in blue chips, while keep-ing a smaller portion in longer-term speculative positions.\nWhat if you’ve paid your dues, learned to trade a few stocks in a\nfew groups, and now want to forage in wider pastures? After all, tech-nical patterns and signals are not all that different in various markets.What if you want to scan a larger number of stocks for MACD diver-gences, Impulse breakouts, or other patterns that you learned to recog-nize, trust, and trade?\nGo on the Internet and find a website that gives you the 100 most\nactive stocks on the NASDAQ (and if you do not know how to findsuch a website, you haven’t got what it takes to trade them). Keepan eye on any stock that floats by you. A newspaper article mentionsseveral companies—look up their stocks. People at a party talk aboutTRADING 185\nstocks—jot them down, drop them into your system, and see how\nthey look on your screen. Many tips call for an exercise of contrarythinking. In summer 2001, Lucent (LU) was in the news with anotherearnings disappointment, having slid from 80 to 6. The journalistswere aghast, but that stock has completed its bear market, traced anattractive bullish divergence, and was poised for a rally. A rise from 6to 9 is a 50% increase. Stocks that people tout at parties are often goodcandidates for shorting. By the time outsiders become interested, therise tends to be over. The idea is to maintain your curiosity and usetips not on their face value but only as invitations to look at this orthat stock. I find that my yield, the percentage of tips that I end uptrading in either direction, is about 5%—I end up trading one out of 20.I have a friend, a brilliant trader, who often calls me asking to take alook at this or that stock. My yield on her tips is 10%—she is the best.\nThe Turnover Ratio The Turnover Ratio (TRO) predicts expected\nvolatility of any stock by comparing its average daily volume with theavailable float. This formula was brought to my attention by Roger PerryofThe RightLine Report (www.rightline.net):\nTRO =monthly volume divided by the available float\nVolume for the past month is easy to calculate. The available float refers\nto the total float, or number of shares issued, minus the holdings of insti-tutions and insiders. Those groups tend to hold positions more tightlythan private traders, who are more likely to sell if the price is right. Allof the above figures are widely available from financial databases.\nYou can calculate the average monthly volume by multiplying the\ndaily volume by 22, the number of trading days in a month. Usingthe daily volume makes the TRO more responsive to changes in volumeas a stock rolls into or out of favor with traders.\nTRO shows how many times the float trades in a month. For exam-\nple, if a stock’s monthly volume is 200 million shares and its availablefloat 100 million, its TRO is 2%. If monthly volume of another stock isalso 200 million, but its available float is 50 million, its TRO is 4.\nIf the average volume is much lower than the float, that stock has a\nlow turnover rate and an onrush of buyers is unlikely to move theprice much. However, if the volume is high relative to the float, thena lot of people compete for few available shares, and a sudden rush ofbuyers can move the price dramatically. 186 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nHigh-TRO stocks tend to be more volatile. Whoever wants to buy\nthem has to pay a premium to pry them out of the hands of relativelyfew holders. When a selling wave hits the markets, the stocks with highTROs tend to go down harder because they do not have a large poolof institutional holders looking to pick up extra shares at a discount.All other factors being equal, the stock with a higher TRO will make abigger percentage move.\nFor example, at the time of this writing, the monthly volume in GE\nwas 355.9 million, with the available float of 9,809 million, resulting ina turnover ratio of 4%. The figures for JNPR were 387.2 million, 155.6million, and 249%. No wonder; GE is a slow-moving blue chip, whereasJNPR is a high-flyer. Check these numbers once a month, as they keepchanging. Stock splits reduce TROs by increasing the float. One splittoo many in DELL has oversaturated the market to the point where thestock has become unattractive for day-traders.\nBlue chips, such as General Electric and IBM, are widely held by\ninstitutions and individuals. Their daily volume, no matter how high, isbut a tiny percentage of their float. New unseasoned stocks often havevery small floats, but when they catch the public’s eye, their daily vol-umes go sky-high, lifting the TRO.\nYou can keep close tabs on the TROs of stocks you track. Whenever\nthe market is active and running, switch into high-TRO stocks. When-ever the market goes into a choppy stage, switch to low-TRO stocksand trade their swings. TRO can help you switch between aggressiveand defensive positions.\nTrading Swings or Trends Whenever you glance at a chart, your eye\nis immediately drawn to major rallies and declines. Big moves attractus with their promise of a killing. Exactly who gets killed is a questionthat seldom crosses beginners’ minds. The trouble with major ralliesand declines is that they are clearly visible in the middle of the chart,but the closer you get to the right edge, the murkier they become.\nBig uptrends are punctuated by drops, while downtrends are inter-\nrupted by rallies. Emotionally, it is extremely hard to hold a positionthrough a countertrend move. As profits melt away, we begin to won-der whether this is a temporary interruption or a full-blown reversal.There is a strong temptation to grab what little money is left and run.Shorter swings are easier to catch because price targets are closer andstops are tighter.TRADING 187\nShould you trade long-term trends or short-term swings? Be sure to\ndecide before you put on a trade; it is easier to be objective when nomoney is at risk. Different stocks have different personalities, which iswhy trend traders and swing traders tend to follow different stocks.\nTraders have three choices. Trend traders identify major trends\nwhich run for months. Swing traders catch short-term swings betweenoptimism and pessimism, which last from a few days to a few weeks.Day-traders enter and exit during the same trading session, with tradeslasting only minutes or hours.\nSuccessful trend trades that catch large moves bring in more money\nper trade. Other advantages include having more time to decide whento enter or exit, not being tied to the screen, and having the emotionalsatisfaction of calling major moves. Trend trading does, however, haveits drawbacks. The stops are farther from the market—when they gethit, you lose more. Also, you have to sit through long periods of inac-tivity, which many people find hard to tolerate, and you miss manyshort-term trading opportunities.\nSwing traders have more opportunities than trend traders, gaining\nmore experience from frequent trades. The dollar risk is lower thanksto closer stops, and quick rewards provide emotional satisfaction.Swing trading also has its drawbacks. Expenses for commissions andslippage are higher, due to more frequent trading. You must workevery day, actively managing trades. Also, you are likely to miss majormoves—you can’t catch big fish on a small hook.\nTrend trading—buying and holding in a major bull market—works\nbest with the type of stocks that Peter Lynch calls 10-baggers, thosethat go up by a factor of 10. They are usually newer, cheaper, less sea-soned issues. An Internet or a biotech company with a hot new inven-tion, a new patent, or a new idea is more likely to go up by a hugepercentage than the stock of an old established firm. A small companymay bet its future on a single idea or product, and its stock will soarif the public buys that bet or stay in the doghouse if it doesn’t. Hada large multinational company come up with the same invention, itsstock would have barely budged because one more product makeslittle difference for a huge firm.\nThe lure of big trends makes stocks of small companies in promis-\ning new industries attractive to trend traders. Swing traders shouldselect their candidates from among the most actively traded stocks onmajor exchanges. Look for large-cap stocks which swing within broad,well-defined channels.188 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nOnce you choose a stock, don’t assume it will continue to behave\nthe same way forever. Companies change, and you must stay on topof your picks. For example, DELL, started by Michael Dell in his col-lege dorm room, used to be a tiny public company, but grew into oneof the largest computer firms in the world. A friend of mine bought$50,000 worth of Dell in the early 1990s and cashed out three yearslater at $2.3 million, but DELL’s days of spiking through the roof anddoubling twice a year are gone. Instead, this widely held stock hasbecome a vehicle for swing traders, and not a very active one at that.\nA beginning trader is better off learning to catch swings, because\nprofit targets and stops are clearer, feedback comes faster, and moneymanagement is easier. The choice between trend trading and swingtrading is partly objective and partly subjective. Should you trade trendsor swings? My impression, after meeting thousands of traders andinvestors, is that the elite tend to trade the big moves and ride majortrends, but people who can do it successfully are few and far between.There are many more traders who make money—sometimes very seri-ous money—by trading swings. The principles of Triple Screen workfor both, even though the entries and especially the exits are different.\nTREND TRADING Trend trading means holding your positions for a long\ntime, sometimes for months. It requires holding while your stocks reactagainst the main trend. Bull and bear markets are driven by shifts inthe fundamentals, such as new technologies and discoveries in the caseof stocks, weather patterns in the case of agricultural markets, politicalshifts in the case of currencies, and so on. Fundamental factors arebehind bull and bear markets, but prices move only in response toactions by traders and investors. When your fundamental informationforecasts a major move, you need to analyze the charts to see whetherthe technicals confirm the fundamentals.\nA market doesn’t send you an invitation before it takes off. When a\ntrend first climbs out of the cellar, few people pay attention. Amateursare fast asleep, while professionals monitor their markets and scan forbreakouts and divergences. Active markets get into the news becausethe lows and especially the highs attract journalists. One of the key dif-ferences between the pros and the outsiders is that the pros alwaystrack their markets, while amateurs wake up and look at charts onlyafter a market hits the news. By that time the train has already left thestation. The ABC Rating System, described on page 255, can help youhandle the challenge of tracking stocks through inactive periods.TRADING 189\nA new breakout is easy to recognize but hard to trade and even\nharder to hold. As a trend speeds up, more and more people pray fora pullback. The stronger the trend, the less likely it is to accommodatebargain hunters. It takes a lot of patience and confidence to hold aposition in a trend. Traders tend to be active men with the attitude of“don’t just sit there, do something.” Learning to be passive comes hardto them. One reason women tend to trade better is that they are morelikely to be patient.\nHow can you teach yourself to trade trends? You may begin by\nstudying historical charts, but remember, there is no substitute forexperience. The idea is to learn by doing. Start by putting on positionsso small that you can be relaxed and not tie your mind into a knot.Trade only a few hundred shares or a single futures contract whileyou’re learning.\nTo apply Triple Screen to trend trading, monitor long-term charts for\nbreakouts or look for well-established moves, identified by a weekly EMA.When the weeklies tell you to be bullish or bearish, return to the dailiesand use oscillators to find entry points. Put on long positions in up-trends when prices touch their rising daily EMA and keep adding onpullbacks. You can also add when daily oscillators, such as MACD-Histogram or Force Index, give buy signals, especially when they coincidewith pullbacks. Reverse the procedure in downtrends. When theweekly trend is down and daily oscillators rally and reach overboughtlevels, they signal to sell short, especially when they coincide with ral-lies to the EMA.\nThe idea is to position yourself in the direction of the market tide\nand use the waves that go against that tide to build up your initial posi-tion. As a beginner, learn to trade a single small position, but once youstart making money, the size of your positions and the number of addi-tions become a function of money management.\nOnce you recognize a new trend, get in! New trends, springing\nout of trading ranges, are notoriously fast, with few or no pullbacks.If you think you have identified a new trend, hop aboard. You canreduce your risk by trading a smaller size, but do not wait for adeep pullback. Those may come later, and you will be able to add toyour position. Jumping aboard a new trend feels counterintuitive, butbeing in the market makes you more alert to its behavior. The greatGeorge Soros was only half-joking when he said, “Buy first, investi-gate later.”190 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nPlace your initial stop at the breakout level, where the new trend\nerupted from the range. A rocket that takes off from its launching padhas no business sinking back to the ground. Do not hurry to moveyour initial stop. Wait for a reaction and then a new move before mov-ing your stop to the bottom of that reaction. The SafeZone stops, whichwork so well for swings, are much too tight for big trends. While rid-ing a tide, you must expect the waves to swing against you and stillhold your position.\nTrend trading means retaining your initial position through thick and\nthin. You are fishing for very big fish, and you need plenty of room. Oneof the reasons so few people make big money from big trends is thatthey become anxious and hyperactive and forget to hang on. Trendsare unlike swings, where you must take profits and run fast. Stay withthe trend unless weekly trend-following indicators go flat or reverse.\nAmateurs often outsmart themselves by trying to pick the end of a\ntrend—a notoriously hard task. As Peter Lynch aptly put it, trying tocatch a bottom is like trying to catch a falling knife—you invariablygrab it in the wrong spot. Trends tend to overshoot rational expecta-tions. News, daily chart patterns, and other distractions try to throwyou off the saddle. Hang on! Consider trading a core position and sup-plementary positions. You may put on a core position with a wide stopand no definite profit target, while swinging in and out of additionalpositions—buying on declines to the EMA or selling on rallies to theupper channel line. Consider using two different accounts for easierrecord keeping.\nSWING TRADING Markets spend most of their time going nowhere.\nThey rally a few days, pause, decline a few days, and rally again. Smallswings—weekly, daily, or hourly—are more common than big trends.By the end of the month the market may be higher or lower, but it hastraveled up and down several times. Newcomers get shaken out, whileprofessionals enjoy the short rides.\nMarkets’ tendency to swing above and below value has been statis-\ntically confirmed by several researchers. Swing trading means buyingnormalcy and selling mania (buy near the rising moving average, sellnear the upper channel line) or shorting normalcy and coveringdepression (sell short near the falling moving average and cover at thelower channel line). The best swing-trading candidates are amongthe m ost active stocks and blue chips that tend to rock, more or lessTRADING 191\nregularly, within their channels. Cats and dogs are best left for trend\ntrading. To draw a list of candidates, start with the 20 most activestocks and a handful of famous blue chips, and choose the ones withthe widest channels and the most regular swings.\nBe sure to select only those candidates whose daily channels are\nwide enough for a C-level trader to take at least a point out of a trade.A C trader is someone who normally takes 10% or more out of a chan-nel. The only way you can prove you are a B or even an A trader isby trading at that level for at least six months. Even A traders are bet-ter off with broad channels because profits are fatter. Beginners haveno choice but to use the “1 point for a C trader” rule. This translatesinto 10-point channels. Technical signals may look delicious, but if achannel is narrower than 10 points, click on to the next stock.\nSome stocks give better technical signals than others. Look for a\nhandful of regular performers; you need six or seven, certainly no morethan 10. Tracking just a handful of issues allows you to keep up yourdaily homework without running ragged or falling behind. Learn thepersonalities of your stocks, rate yourself on every trade, and once youbecome a steady B trader, increase your trading size.\nWhen the weekly trend is up, wait for daily oscillators to become\noversold while prices decline toward the EMA. When the weekly trendis down, look for sell signals from daily oscillators while prices rallytoward the EMA. If an oscillator falls to a new multi-month low whileprices are moving toward the EMA, it shows that bears are extra strongand it is better to put off buying until the following bottom. The reverseapplies to shorting.\nIn a weekly uptrend, the bottoms of daily charts tend to be very\nsharp affairs. The best time to buy is when the market stabs below itsdaily EMA. The best time to short is when the market stabs above it.To place an order near the EMA, estimate its level for tomorrow. Themath is simple. You know where the EMA was yesterday and where itclosed today. If it has risen, say, by half a point, expect tomorrow’s risealso to be half a point and add that to today’s EMA.\nTake a look at how your stock has behaved since the latest trend\nbegan. If the trend is up, look at the previous declines. If the stock hasreturned to the EMA three times and penetrated it by an average of apoint and a half, place a buy order approximately a point below themoving average, a little more shallow than the previous declines. Esti-mate the EMA for tomorrow and adjust your buy orders daily. Electronicbrokers do not become irritated when you change orders each day!192 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nSwing trading, like fishing, demands a great deal of attention and\npatience. You need to do your homework daily, calculate the estimatedEMA for tomorrow, and place orders. You also must calculate yourprofit targets and stops.\nAfter entering a swing trade, place a protective stop, using the\nSafeZone method. Swing trading is a high-wire act, requiring a safetynet. Stops and money management are essential for your survival andsuccess.\nTake profits near the channel line. The exact level depends on the\nstrength of the swing. If MACD-Histogram and Force Index are makingnew highs, the market is strong, and you can wait for the channel lineto be hit. If they act weak, grab your first profit while it’s still there.What if a strong swing overshoots the channel line? An experiencedtrader may shift his tactics and hold a little longer, perhaps until theday when the market fails to reach a new extreme. A beginner musttrain himself to take profits near the channel wall because he does nothave the skills to switch on the fly. Being able to take a limited profitwithout kicking yourself for missing a big part of a move is a sign ofemotional maturity. It is liberating to accept what you asked for andnot worry about the rest. Profit targets help you create a structure inan unstructured environment. Measure your performance as the per-centage of the channel width. You must grade yourself to know whereyou stand.\nEarly in your trading career, it is safer to concentrate on swings. As\nyour level of expertise rises, allocate a portion of your capital to trad-ing trends. Major trends offer spectacular profit opportunities—the bigmoney is in big moves. You owe it to yourself to learn to trade them.Concentrate on quality, and money will follow.\nOptions\nThe number of shares in any company is fixed, but options are createdout of thin air by writers responding to buyers’ demand. An optionbuyer hopes that the price will get to his target fast enough, and thewriter sells him that hope. Most hopes never get fulfilled, but peoplekeep hoping and buying options. Fund managers, floor traders, andexchange members sell hope by the truckload to amateurs who buycalls in bull markets and puts in bear markets.\nA call gives its holder a right, but not an obligation, to buy a certain\nquantity of a specified security at a specified price at a specified time.TRADING 193\nIt is a bet on a price increase. A put is a right, but not an obligation,\nto sell a certain quantity of a specified security at a specified price at aspecified time. It is a bet on a price drop.\nEach option has an exercise price (also called strike price ). If a\nstock fails to reach that price before the exercise date, the optionexpires worthless and the buyer loses what he paid; meanwhile, thewriter keeps his loot, the polite name of which is option premium . To\nprofit from buying or shorting stocks, you must pick the right stockand the right direction. An option buyer’s job is much harder be-cause in addition to that he must bet on how fast the stock will getto his level.\nAn option is at-the-money when the current price of the underlying secu-\nrity equals the exercise price.\nA call is out-of-the-money when the current price of the underlying secu-\nrity is below the exercise price. A put is out-of-the-money when the cur-rent price of the underlying is above the exercise price. The fartherout-of-the-money, the cheaper the option.\nA call is in-the-money when the current price of the underlying security is\nabove the exercise price. A put is in-the-money when the current priceof the underlying is below the exercise price.\nAn option can be at-the-money, out-of-the-money, or in-the-money at\ndifferent times in its life, as the price of the underlying security changes.The price of every option has two components: intrinsic value andtime value.\nAn option’s intrinsic value is above zero only when it’s in-the-money.\nIf the exercise price of a call is $80, and the underlying security risesto $83, the intrinsic value is $3. If the security is at or below $80, theintrinsic value of that call is zero.\nThe other component of each option’s price is time value. If the stock\ntrades at $74 and people pay $2 for an $80 call, the entire $2 representstime value. If the stock rises to $83, and the price of the call jumps to$4, $3 of that is intrinsic value ($83 − $80), while $1 is time value (the\nhope that this stock will rise even higher during the life of that option).\nOption price depends on several factors:\nThe farther out-of-the-money, the cheaper the option—the underlying\nsecurity must travel a longer distance to make it worth anything beforeit expires.194 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nThe closer the expiration day, the cheaper the option—it has less time to\nfulfill the hope. The speed with which an option loses value is calledtime decay , which becomes steeper as the expiration nears.\nThe less volatile the underlying security, the cheaper the option, because\nthe chance of that security making a large move is lower.\nOther factors influencing the price of an option include the current level\nof interest rates and the dividend rate of the underlying stock.\nWhen a stock trades at 100, a 110 call is worth more that a 120 call\nbecause that stock is more likely to rise to 110 than to 120. A stock ismore likely to rise to 110 in five months than in two, making a longercall more valuable. Finally, if two stocks are selling for 100, but onehas moved 50 so far this year while the other has moved only 30, thena 110 call for the more volatile stock is likely to be priced higher.\nDifferent factors of option pricing may clash and partially cancel\neach other out. For example, if a market drops sharply, reducing thevalue of calls, the increase in volatility will lift option values, and thecalls may lose less value than expected. There are several mathemati-cal models, such as Black-Scholes, widely described in options litera-ture, to determine what is called a fair value of an option.\nThe simplest option strategy is to buy them. That’s what beginners\ndo, especially buying calls when they cannot afford to buy stocks.They miss the fact that options are more complex than stocks andsomeone who can’t make money in stocks is doomed in options. A moresophisticated strategy involves writing, or selling, options. A writer maybe either covered or naked.\nCovered writers own the underlying securities. For example, a fund\nmay hold IBM stock and sell calls against them, figuring that if thestock does not reach its exercise price and the options expire worth-less, they’ll pocket the extra income. If IBM rises to the exercise priceand their option is called, they’ll sell their stock at a profit, use themoney to buy another, and sell calls against it. Covered writing wasvery profitable in the early years of exchange-traded options. By nowthe field is very crowded, and the returns have shrunk. Naked writing,to be reviewed later involves selling options without owning theunderlying securities, with writers backing up what they sell only withcash in their accounts.\nThe above was a brief summary of option terms. To learn more, please\nturn to the literature on options, listed at the end of this chapter. JustTRADING 195\nwatch out for the books that promise a “simple strategy for tripling\nyour money in a year, working 15 minutes a day, with no math.”People who make money in options tend to be mathematically savvyand highly capitalized, the exact opposite of an average wide-eyedgambler who hopes to make a quick buck from his $5,000 stake. Letus now review options strategies for buying and writing.\nBuying Options—The Major Reversal Tactic It is harder to make\nmoney buying options than stocks. You face all the usual problems, suchas choosing the right stock, identifying its trend, and selecting entry andexit points. In addition, you must worry how fast your stock will getwhere you expect it to go. If you buy a rising stock and it takes fivemonths instead of three to reach its target, you still have a winning trade.Do the same with options, and they’ll expire worthless. If you decide tobuy more time by getting longer-term options, you’ll lose money in a dif-ferent way, because those options are more expensive and move moreslowly. All options keep losing time value. Poor beginners who buythem as a substitute for stocks rush in where the pros fear to tread!\nProfessionals tend to buy options only on special occasions, when\nthey expect a major reversal, especially to the downside. If you expectnot a little downtrend in a stock but a massive crash, buying a put maybe a good idea. When a long-term trend begins to turn, especially nearthe top, it creates massive turbulence, like an ocean liner changing itscourse. A stock may collapse today and soar tomorrow, only to collapseagain. When volatility goes through the roof, even well-heeled tradershave trouble placing stops. A stop belongs outside the zone of marketnoise, but where do you put it when the noise level rises to a roar?Options allow you to sidestep this problem, at a price which can onlybe covered by a major move.\nPrices tend to fall twice as fast as they rise. Greed, the dominant emo-\ntion of uptrends, is a happy and lasting feeling. Fear, the dominant emo-tion of downtrends, is sharper and more violent. Professionals are morelikely to buy puts because of shorter exposure to time decay. When youexpect a major downside reversal, buying a put can be a sensible trade.The same principles apply to calls, but uptrends are better traded withstocks.\nA trader who expects a downswing must decide which put to buy. The\nbest choice is counterintuitive and different from what most people get.\nEstimate how low you expect a stock to collapse. A put is worth buy-\ning only if you expect a waterfall decline. 196 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nAvoid puts with more than two months of life. Buying puts makes\nsense only when you expect a sharp decline. If you anticipate a drawn-out downtrend, it is better to sell short the underlying security.\nLook for cheap puts whose price reflects no hope. Move your finger\ndown the column of put strikes. The lower you go, the cheaper theputs. At first, each time you drop to the next strike price, a put is 25%or even 35% cheaper than the previous level. Eventually you come tothe strike level at which you would only save a tiny fraction of price.This shows that all hope has been squeezed out of that put, and it ispriced like a cheap lottery ticket. That is the one you want!\nBuying a very cheap, far-out-of-the-money put is counterintuitive. It\nis so far-out-of-the-money and has so little life left in it that it seemslikely to expire worthless. You can’t place a stop on it, so if you’rewrong, the entire premium will go up in smoke. Why not buy a putcloser to the money?\nThe only time to buy a put is when you’re shooting for an excep-\ntional gain from a major reversal. In an ordinary downtrend it’s betterto short stocks. Cheap far-out-of-the-money puts provide the most bangfor the buck. Aim for a 10-fold gain or better, rather than the usual 2:1or 3:1 ratio. Returns like these allow you to be wrong on a string oftrades, yet come out ahead in the end. Catching one major reversal willmake up for a string of losses and leave you very profitable.\nThe best options trade I ever made was during the October 1989\nminicrash in the stock market. On Thursday the market closed weak,with new lows exceeding the new highs for the first time in over ayear, which gave me a long-awaited sell signal. On Friday morning,while at a trade show in Chicago, I bought OEX puts at \n3⁄8. On Friday\nafternoon the bottom fell out of the market. On Monday the marketopened sharply lower and my puts, purchased just a few trading hoursago at less than half a point, were bid at 17.\nWhy don’t more people use this tactic? First, it requires a great deal\nof patience, as opportunities are very infrequent. It offers very littleentertainment value. Most people cannot stomach the idea of beingwrong three, four, or five times in a row, even if they are likely to makemoney in the end. This is why so few traders play one of the greatestgames in the options market.\nWriting Options Beginners, gamblers, and undercapitalized traders\nmake up the majority of option buyers. Just think of all the money lostby those hapless folks in their eagerness to get rich quick. Have youTRADING 197\nsent a few dollars down the options hole? Who got all that money?\nBrokers, of course, but mostly options writers. Well-capitalized profes-sionals tend to write options rather than buy them. Covered writers selloptions against securities they own. Naked writers sell options withoutowning the underlying securities.\nA stock or a future can do one of three things: rise, fall, or stay flat.\nWhen you buy a call, you can profit only if the market rises, but loseif it goes down or stays flat, and sometimes even if it rises but notfastenough. When you buy a put, you win only if the market falls fast\nenough. An options buyer makes money only if the market goes hisway, but loses if it goes against him or stays flat. A buyer has one chanceto win out of three, but the odds are two out of three for an optionwriter. No wonder the pros prefer writing options.\nLarge funds tend to use computerized models to buy stocks and\nwrite covered calls against them. If a stock stays below the strike price,they pocket the premium and write a new call with a new expirationdate. If a stock rises high enough to be called, they deliver it, collectthe money, invest in another stock, and write calls against it. Coveredwriting is a mathematically demanding, capital-intensive business. Mostserious players spread their costs, including staff and equipment,across a large capital base. A small trader doesn’t have much of anedge in this expensive enterprise.\nNaked writers sell options without owning the underlying securities,\nsimilar to shorting. A naked writer collects his premium at the outsetof the trade but his risk is unlimited if the position goes against himand he fails to get out. If you own a stock, sell a call, and that stockgets called, you have something to deliver. If you sell a naked calland the stock rises to its exercise price, the option buyer can demanddelivery, whether you own that stock or not. Imagine selling calls ona stock that becomes a takeover play and opens $50 higher the nextmorning—you still have to deliver. It can hurt.\nLimited reward with unlimited risk scares most traders away from\nnaked writing, but the reality and perception are usually quite differ-ent in the markets. Writing naked options seems very dangerous, butmost of the time a far-out-of-the-money option with a short time to theexpiration is very likely to expire worthless, to the benefit of the writer.Its chance of reaching the exercise price and causing a loss to a writeris very low. The risk/reward ratio in naked writing is a lot better thanit looks, and there are techniques for reducing the impact of a rareadverse move.198 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nSavvy naked writers tend to sell out-of-the-money calls and puts at\nlevels that a stock or a commodity is unlikely to reach during theoption’s life. They sell distant hopes. Good writers track market volatil-ity to find how far a stock is likely to move, based on its recent con-duct, and sell options outside that range. If a stock took a year to risefrom 60 to 130, the pros are going to fall all over themselves trying toserve some greenhorn who wants to buy 170 calls that will expire in afew weeks. The chance of that stock rising 40 points before the optionexpiration is exceedingly low. A gullible amateur wants to buy hope,and the pros are delighted to sell it to him. This game goes into highgear during the week or two prior to option expiration, when the floormints money out of thin air, selling naked puts and calls that havealmost no chance of reaching their exercise price.\nCautious writers may close their positions without waiting for the\nexpiration date. If you write a call at 90 cents and it goes down to 10,it may make sense to buy it back and unwind your position. You’vealready earned the bulk of profit, so why expose yourself to continuedrisk? It is cheaper to pay another commission, book your profits, andlook for another writing opportunity.\nBecoming a naked writer requires absolute iron discipline. The size\nof your writes and the number of positions must be strictly determinedby money management rules. If you sell a naked call and the stock ral-lies above its exercise price, it exposes you to the risk of ruin. Youmust decide in advance at what level you will cut and run, taking a rel-atively small loss. A naked seller cannot afford to sit when a stockmoves against him. Amateurs hang on and wait for the underlyingsecurity to turn around. They wait for the wasting time value to getthem off the hook. The longer you wait for a miracle, the deeper thesteel hook of the market lodges in your intestines. Stay away fromnaked writing if you have the slightest problem with discipline!\nWRITER ’SCHOICE All options buyers know this sad sequence: you’re\nright on the direction of the market, right on the stock, but still losemoney on the option. Time is the enemy of options buyers. Buyerslose when the underlying security takes longer than expected to get tothe level at which they can collect on their bet. As the expiration datenears, an option becomes worth less, and less, and less.\nWhat if we reverse this process and write rather than buy options?\nNow time will work in our favor because each passing day will reducethe likelihood of that option having any value before it expires.TRADING 199\nThe first time you write an option, and do it right, you’ll experience\nthe delicious sensation of time working in your favor. The option losessome of its time value each day, making the premium you’ve collectedsafer and safer. When the market goes nowhere, you still make money,as time value evaporates with each passing day.\nIf living well is the best revenge, then taking a factor that kills most\noptions buyers—time—and making it work for you is a gratifyingexperience.\nWe must not forget that an option is a hope, and it is better to sell\nempty hopes which are unlikely to be fulfilled. Take three steps beforewriting a call or a put. First, analyze the underlying security, decidewhich way it’s moving, and estimate its price target. Second, decidewhether to write a put or a call. Third, choose the strike price and theexpiration date for the option you’ll write. If any one of these stepsseems unclear, stand aside, do not force a decision, and look foranother opportunity.\nOne of the key factors in pricing options is the volatility of the\nunderlying security. A tool included in most trading software, calledBollinger bands, can help you rate volatility. Those standard deviationbands are centered around a moving average but unlike envelopes,whose walls are parallel, they expand and contract as volatility changes.Bollinger bands become narrow when markets are sleepy and widewhen they grow wild. Flat, narrow bands indicate a sleepy marketwhere options are cheap and it is better to buy them rather than sell.When Bollinger bands go to a wide spread, they mark an overheatedmarket where options tend to be overpriced, creating an opportunityfor writers. Here are the steps to follow:\nAnalyze a security against which you want to write options. Use\nTriple Screen to decide whether a stock, future, or an index is trend-ing or nontrending. Use weekly and daily charts, trend-followingindicators, and oscillators to identify trends, detect reversals, and set upprice targets.\nSelect the type of option to write. If your analysis is bearish, consider\nwriting calls. If bullish, consider writing puts. When the trend is up, sellthe hope that it will turn down, and when it’s down, sell the hope it’llturn up. Do not write options when markets are flat and Bollingerbands are tight because premiums are low, and a breakout from a trad-ing range can hurt you.\nEstimate how far, with a generous safety margin, the market would\nhave to move in order to change its trend, and write an option beyond200 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nthat zone. Write an option with a strike price the market is unlikely to\nreach before the expiration. Suppose a stock is at 80, having risen from50 in the past year and is now rising half a point per week, with 8weeks left to option expiration. The trend is up, and selling a 70 putunder those circumstances means selling an option that is likely toexpire worthless.\nThe temptation to sell naked options close to the money and get\nfatter premiums is dangerous, because a slight countertrend move canpush your position underwater. Look at the number of weeks remain-ing to the expiration, calculate the distance the market is likely to travelbased on its recent behavior, and write an option outside that range.\nWrite options with no more than two months to the expiration. The\nshorter the time, the fewer surprises. The erosion of time value accel-erates in the last few weeks of option life. When you write optionsclose to the expiration, you benefit from faster time decay. You can getmore money for options with longer life, but do not get greedy. Thegoal of a writer is not to make a killing on any single trade but to grindout a steady income.\nLIMITING RISKA trader can keep writing naked calls or puts, but do it\nlong enough, and some day he will get caught on the wrong side of apowerful move. Profits of several years can be wiped out in a single day.\nFor example, whenever there is a great bull market, the pros look\nat selling puts like a license to print money. The contrarians, thealarmists, and “the end is nigh” crowd keep buying puts for years andlosing money, but suddenly there is a crash and buyers have their dayin the sun. The pros who have been feeding off them for years facetheir day of reckoning—the quick ones survive, while the slow onesare carried out feet first.\nA trader can grow fat and greedy writing naked options, selling\nuseless contracts created out of thin air and pocketing profits. Asmug feeling of self-satisfaction blinds people to reality. Naked posi-tions in options need to be protected by stops and money manage-ment rules.\nUse a mental stop-loss on the underlying security. Set a stop on the\nunderlying stock, future, or index and not on the price of your option.Buy back that option if the underlying security reaches your stop level.For example, if you sell a naked 80 call on a stock trading at 70, placeyour stop at 77. Get out of your naked option position before it getsinto the money by crossing its exercise price.TRADING 201\nYour stop is like an ejection seat on an aircraft. If you write an out-\nof-the-money option and the market starts moving into the money,there is no point in sticking around, waiting to see what happens next.You are wrong, and you’re losing—push the eject button before thedamage turns deadly. If you sold an option for 1.50, by the time it hitsyour at-the-money stop level it may double in price to 3. If you usestops, you’ll be nowhere near the “unlimited loss” that makes peopleafraid to write options.\nSet your profit-taking zone—consider buying back your naked\noption. When you write a call or a put, you sell a wasting asset. When\nthe underlying security moves far from the exercise price but there isstill time left to the expiration, the price of that option may reach itsrock bottom. It loses value only in tiny dribs and drabs. The loser whobought that option still has a bit of a chance that the market mayreverse in his favor. He continues to hold that call or put like a lotteryticket, and once in a rare while his ticket may win.\nWhy hold an open position in an option that has already given you\nmost of its value? You have little to gain, while remaining exposed tothe risk of an adverse move. Consider buying back that option to closeout your profitable trade.\nOpen an insurance account. A naked seller needs insurance against\na catastrophic reversal. You may write a put and the market crashesthe next day, or you write a call and suddenly there is a takeover. Youhope this never happens, but trade long enough and eventually every-thing will happen! That’s why you need insurance. Nobody will writeit for you, so you’ll have to self-insure.\nOpen a money market account, and every time you close out a\nnaked writing position, throw a percentage of your profit, 10 percentor more, into that account. Do not use it for trading. Have it sit there,in a money market fund, for as long as you write options. Your insur-ance account grows with each new profit, ready to cover a catastrophicloss or to be taken out in cash when you stop writing options!\nOption writers get hurt in one of three ways. Beginners overtrade and\nwrite too many options, breaking money management rules. Intermediate-level traders get hurt when they fail to run fast enough when theiroptions move against them. Experienced traders can get blown out ifthey do not have a reserve against a major adverse move. The longeryou trade, the greater your risk of a catastrophic event. Having an insur-ance account confirms your position as a professional option writer.202 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?Every options trader should own Lawrence\nMcMillan’s Options as a Strategic Investment and use it as a handbook.\nMost professional traders read Sheldon Natenberg’s Option Volatility\nand Pricing Strategies. Harvey Friedentag’s Options: Investing without\nFearhas a nice angle on covered writing.\nFutures\nFutures used to have such a bad reputation that several states tried to\noutlaw them a century ago. They used to have Sunday sermons againstfutures in parts of the agricultural belt. None of that prevented futuresfrom evolving into a potent economic force.\nFutures markets have prospered because they serve two groups that\nhave a great deal of money. On the one hand, futures permit majorcommercial producers and consumers to hedge price risks, giving thema fantastic competitive advantage. On the other hand, futures offer spec-ulators a gambling palace with more choices than all the casinos inNevada. Between the hedgers and the speculators, on a ground richlysoaked with blood and money, are professional futures traders. Theyhelp move the wheels of commerce and take a fee for their services. A signof their profitability is the fact that many of those public servants passtheir craft to their sons and now occasionally even to their daughters.\nHedging means opening a futures position that is the opposite of\none’s position in the actual commodity. It removes the price risk fromholding a cash commodity or planning to buy such a commodity in thefuture. Hedgers transfer price risks to commodity speculators. Thisallows them to concentrate on their core businesses, offer better con-sumer pricing, and obtain a long-term competitive advantage over theirunhedged competitors.\nFor example, I have two friends, brokers in Moscow, who teach\nsugar importers how to hedge (Russia has become the world’s biggestimporter of sugar since the breakup of the Soviet Union). Their clientsare big players in the food industry, who know up to a year in advancehow much sugar they’re going to need. Now they can buy sugar futuresin London or New York when prices are low enough. They are goingto need their trainloads of sugar many months from now, but mean-while they hold sugar futures, which they plan to sell when they buytheir cash position. In effect, they are short cash, long futures. If sugarprices go up and they have to pay more than expected, they will offsetTRADING 203\nthat loss by making roughly the same profit on their futures positions.\nTheir unhedged competitors are in effect flipping a coin. If sugar pricesfall, they’ll buy on the cheap and reap a windfall, but if they rise, they’llbe hung out to dry. The importers who are hedged can concentrate onrunning their core business instead of watching the price ticker.\nProducers of commodities also benefit from hedging. An agribusi-\nness can presell its wheat, coffee, or cotton when prices are highenough to guarantee profits. They sell short as many futures contractsas it takes to cover their prospective crop. From that point on, theyhave no price risk. If prices go down, they’ll make up their losses oncash commodities by profits on futures. If prices go up, they’ll losemoney on their short positions in futures but make it back sellingthe actual commodities. Producers give up a chance of a windfall butinsulate themselves from the risk of lower prices. Survivors thrive onstability. That why the Exxons, the Coca-Colas, and the Nabiscos areamong the major players in the commodity markets. Hedgers are theultimate insiders, and a good hedging department not only buys priceinsurance, but serves as a profit center.\nSpeculators step in to assume market risks, lured by the glitter of\nprofits. Hedgers, with their inside information, are not fully confidentabout future prices, while crowds of cheerful outsiders plunk downmoney to bet on price direction. It reminds me how, years ago, Iwalked into a liquor store with a scientist friend to buy some wine fordinner. This was soon after the state of New Jersey introduced a lot-tery to pay for education. There was a huge line at the counter, as lot-tery tickets in those days were sold only in liquor stores. When myfriend, who owned a house in New Jersey, saw what was happening,he doubled up laughing, “You mean these people are lining up tokeep my taxes down?!” That’s pretty much what most speculators doin futures.\nThe two largest groups of speculators are farmers and engineers.\nFarmers produce commodities, while engineers love to apply scientificmethods to the market game. Many small farmers enter futures marketsas hedgers but catch the bug and start speculating. There’s nothingwrong with that, as long as they know what they are doing. It neverceases to amaze me how many farmers end up trading stock indexfutures. As long as they trade corn, cattle, or soybeans, their feel forthe fundamentals gives them an edge over city slickers. But what’s theiredge in the S&P 500? Faster reflexes than the rest of us? Gimme a break!204 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nThere is one profound difference between futures and stocks, mak-\ning the futures game extremely fast, furious, exciting, and deadly. Thefutures markets are turbocharged by a simple but potent device of lowmargin requirements.\nUnited States securities law demands that in the stock market you pay\nat least half the cash value of your position. Your broker can give youa margin loan for the other half. If you have $30,000 in your account,you may buy $60,000 worth of stocks, and no more. The law waspassed after the Crash of 1929 when people realized that low marginsled to excessive speculation, which contributed to the viciousness ofdeclines. Prior to 1929, speculators could buy stocks on a 10% margin,which worked great in bull markets but wiped them out in bear markets.\nMargins of only three to five percent are common in the futures mar-\nkets. Here you can bet big with little money. If you have $30,000, youcan control $1,000,000 worth of merchandise, be it pork bellies or gold.If you catch a 1% move in your market, you’ll make $10,000, or over30% profit on your account. A few trades like that, and you’ve madeit. A small trader looks at these numbers and thinks he’s found thesecret to getting rich quick. There is only one problem. Before thatmarket rises 1% it may dip 2%. It may be a meaningless blip, but at thebottom the amate ur’s equity will be nearly wiped out, and his broker will\nsell him out on a mar gin call. He’ll go bust even though his price fore-\ncast was correct.\nThe mortality rate among futures traders is over 90 percent, even\nthough brokerage houses try to hide statistics. Easy margins attractgamblers and adrenaline addicts who quickly go up in smoke. Thereis nothing wrong with trading futures that money management won’tcure. Futures are very tradable, as long as you observe money man-agement rules and do not go crazy with an easy margin. You have tobe more than disciplined—to trade commodities you must be colderthan a freezer. If you cannot follow money management rules, better goto Las Vegas. The entertainment value is just as high and the outcomeis the same, but the drinks are free and the floor show more glitzy.\nPrecisely because they require a high degree of discipline and excel-\nlent money management skills, futures markets are hard for beginners.A new trader is better off learning to trade slower-moving stocks, butlater on, futures definitely deserve a look.\nIf you know how to trade and want to make a quick fortune, futures\nare the place to be. You may put on small initial positions, fenced inTRADING 205\nby strict money management rules, but then you can pyramid them to\nthe hilt as a trade moves in your favor and you keep moving stopsbeyond breakeven and adding new contracts.\nThere are only a few dozen futures, making the choice of which to\ntrade much easier than among the thousands of stocks. Be sure tofocus on markets in your own time zone. It is shocking how manybeginners, especially outside the United States, want to trade curren-cies. Few of them stop to think that this is a 24-hour market, operatingaround the clock, in which an individual trader has many disadvan-tages. You may brilliantly analyze a currency and forecast a move, butthat move is just as likely to take place in another time zone while youare sleeping. Try to select markets that trade in your time zone that areopen when you are awake and closed when you’re asleep.\nIt is a good idea to make your first steps in those markets where you\nknow something about the fundamentals. If you are a cattle rancher, ahouse builder, or a loan officer, then cattle, lumber, or interest ratefutures are logical starting points, if you can afford to trade them. If youhave no particular interests, your choice is limited only by youraccount size. It is important to make your first steps in relatively inex-pensive markets. All markets have a certain amount of random noise,or quick countertrend moves. The high dollar value of random movesin expensive markets can be deadly.\nTake yourself through a simple exercise. Create a spreadsheet on\nyour computer and write down the names of several futures marketsthat interest you in column A. Write the value of their price units in col-umn B. Corn trades in cents, and the value of a cent is $50; S&P tradesin points, and the value of a point is $250, so those values go into col-umn B. Write the latest closing price in column C. Now complete theexercise by creating column D which multiplies B by C and shows howmuch each contract is worth. How much more expensive is the richestcontract compared to the cheapest contract? Five times? Ten? Twenty?Thirty? Do the exercise and find out.\nBeginners are drawn to the S&P 500 futures, but few have accounts\nlarge enough for proper money management in this expensive mar-ket. In North America, corn, sugar, and, in a slow year, copper aregood markets for beginners, allowing you to learn in your own timezone. They are liquid, reasonably volatile, and not too expensive.\nSome very good books, listed on page 213, have been written about\nfutures. Most technical analysis tools were originally developed for206 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nfutures and only later migrated to the stock market. Let us review a few\naspects of futures that make them different from stocks.\nCONTANGO AND INVERSION All futures markets offer contracts for several\ndelivery months at the same time. For example, you can buy or sellwheat for delivery in September or December of this year, March ofnext year, and so on. Normally, the nearby months are less expensivethan the faraway months, and that relationship is called a contango\nmarket .\nHigher prices for longer-term contracts reflect the so-called cost of\ncarry, that is, the cost of financing, storing, and insuring a commodity.\nA futures buyer plunks down his 3% margin and controls a contractwithout having to bring the rest of the money until the settlement date.Meanwhile the seller has to store, finance, and insure the merchandise.\nThe differences between delivery months are called premiums.\nHedgers and floor traders closely watch premiums because they reflectthe degree of tightness in the market. When the supply shrinks or thedemand rises, people start paying up for the nearby months. The pre-mium for the faraway months begins to shrink. As the demand grows,the front months become pricier than faraway months—the marketbecomes inverted! This is one of the strongest fundamental signs of abull market. There is a real shortage out there, and people are payingextra to get their stuff sooner rather than later.\nWhenever you look at the commodity page of a financial newspa-\nper, move your finger down the column of closing prices and look forinversions. They signal bull markets, and that’s when you want to usetechnical analysis to look for buying opportunities. \nSerious hedgers do not wait for inversions. They monitor premiums\nand get their signals from their narrowing or widening. A good specu-lator can rattle off the latest prices, but a good hedger will quote youthe latest premiums of faraway contracts over the nearby ones.\nAs you scan futures markets for inversions, keep in mind that there\nis one area in which inversion is the norm. Interest rate futures arealways inverted because those who hold cash positions keep collect-ing interest instead of paying finance and storage charges.\nSPREADS Hedgers tend to dominate the short side of the markets and\nmost speculators are perpetual bulls, but floor traders love to tradespreads. Spreading means buying one delivery month and sellingTRADING 207\nanother in the same market, or going long one market and short a\nrelated one.\nFutures are the basic building blocks of the economy, essential for\nsociety’s daily functioning. Economic necessities tightly link commoditymarkets and delivery months. If the price of corn, a major animal feed,starts to rise faster than the price of wheat, at some point ranchers willstart using wheat rather than corn. They’ll reduce their purchases ofcorn while buying more wheat, pushing their spread back towards thenorm. A savvy commodity trader knows his normal spreads by heart.Spread traders bet against deviations and for a return to normalcy. Inthis situation, a spreader will short corn and buy wheat, instead of tak-ing a directional trade in either market.\nSpread trades are much safer than directional trades, with even\nlower margin requirements. Amateurs do not understand spreads andhave little interest in these reliable but slow-moving trades. There areseveral books on spreads but not a single good one at the time of thiswriting, a sign of how well professionals have sewn up this area ofknowledge and kept the amateurs out. There is a handful of niches inthe markets where professionals are making fortunes without the ben-efit of a single good how-to book. It looks almost as if the insiders haveposted a sign for the outsiders to keep out.\nCOMMITMENTS OF TRADERS The Commodity Futures Trading Commission\ncollects reports from brokers on the positions of traders and releasestheir summaries to the public. Those COT (commitments of traders)reports are among the best sources of information on what the smartmoney is doing in the futures markets. COT reports reveal positions ofthree groups: hedgers, big traders, and small traders. How do theyknow who is who? Hedgers identify themselves to brokers becausethat entitles them to several advantages, such as lower margin rates.Big traders are identified by holding the number of contracts above“reporting requirements,” set by the government. Whoever is not ahedger or a big trader is a small trader.\nIn the old days, big traders used to be the smart money. Today, the\nmarkets are bigger, the reporting requirements much higher, and bigtraders are likely to be commodity funds, most of them not muchsmarter than the run-of-the-mill trader. Hedgers are today’s smartmoney but understanding their positions isn’t as easy as it seems.\nFor example, a COT report may show that in a certain market,\nhedgers hold 70% of shorts. A beginner who thinks this is bearish may208 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nbe completely off the mark without knowing that normally hedgers\nhold 90% of shorts in that market, making the 70% stance wildly bull-ish. Savvy COT analysts compare current positions to historical normsand look for situations where hedgers, or the smart money, and smalltraders, many of whom are gamblers and losers, are dead set againsteach other. If one group is heavily short while the other is just as heav-ily long, which one would you like to join? If you find that in a certainmarket the smart money is overwhelmingly on one side, while thesmall specs are mobbing the other, it is time to use technical analysisto look for entries on the side of hedgers.\nSUPPLY AND DEMAND MARKETS In futures, there are two types of bull\nand bear markets: supply-driven and demand-driven. Supply-drivenmarkets tend to be fast and furious, whereas demand-driven marketstend to be quiet and slow. Why? Think of any commodity, say coffee,which grows in Africa and South America.\nChanges in demand come slowly, thanks to the conservatism of\nhuman nature. The demand for coffee can go up only if drinkingbecomes more popular, with a second espresso machine in every littlebar. The demand can fall only if coffee drinking becomes less popular,which may happen in a deteriorating economy or in response to ahealth fad. Demand-driven markets move at a leisurely pace.\nNow imagine that a major coffee growing area is hit by a hurricane\nor a freeze. Suddenly the world supply of coffee is rumored to bereduced by 10% and prices shoot through the roof, cutting off marginalconsumers and rising to the point where supply and demand are inbalance. Supply-driven markets are very volatile. Imagine torrentialrains in the cocoa-producing areas of Africa, or a new OPEC policysharply curtailing oil supply, or a general strike in a leading copper-mining country. When the supply of a commodity is reduced andrumors of further damage swirl, the trend shoots up, reallocating tightsupplies to those best able to afford them.\nEvery futures trader must be aware of key supply factors in his mar-\nket and keep an eye on them, such as the weather during the criticalgrowing and harvesting months in agricultural commodities. Trendtraders in the futures markets tend to look for supply-driven markets,while swing traders do better in demand-driven markets. \nThe United States grain markets often have price spikes during the\nspring and summer planting and growing seasons as dry spells, floods,and pests threaten supplies. Traders say that a farmer loses his crop threeTRADING 209\ntimes before harvesting it. Once the harvest is in and the supply is known,\ndemand drives the markets. Demand-driven markets have narrower\nchannels, making profit targets smaller. Channels have to be r edrawn\nand trading tactics adjusted as seasons change. A lazy trader wonderswhy his tools stopped working. A smart trader gets out a new set of toolsfor the season and puts old ones in storage until the next year.\nFLOOR AND CEILING The fundamental analysis of futures is more straight-\nforward than that of stocks. Most analysts monitor supplies since\ndemand changes very slowly. What is the planted acreage? What are\nthe warehouse stocks? What is the weather forecast for the growing areas?Fundamentals put a floor underneath most, though not all, commodi-ties. They also have a natural ceiling above which they almost never rise.\nThe floor depends on the cost of production. When the market price\nof a commodity, be it gold or sugar, falls below that level, miners stopdigging and farmers stop planting. Some third-world governments, des-perate for dollars and trying to avoid social unrest, may subsidize pro-duction, paying locals in worthless currency and dumping the producton the world market. Still, if enough producers go broke and quit, thesupply will shrink and prices will rise to draw in new suppliers. If youtake 20-year charts of most commodities, you’ll see that the same priceareas have served as a floor year after year. Curiously enough, thoselevels have held without being adjusted for inflation.\nThe ceiling depends on the cost of substitution. If the price of a com-\nmodity rises, major industrial consumers will start switching away fromit. If soybean meal, a major animal feed, becomes too expensive, thedemand will switch to fishmeal; if sugar becomes too costly, the demandwill switch to other sweeteners.\nWhy don’t more people trade against those levels? Why don’t they\nbuy near the floor and short near the ceiling, profiting from what issimilar to shooting fish in a barrel? First of all, the floor and the ceilingare not set in stone, and markets may briefly violate them. Even moreimportantly, human psychology works against those trades. Most spec-ulators find it impossible to sell short a market that is boiling near thehigh or go long a market after it has crashed.\nSEASONALS Most commodities fluctuate through the seasons. For\nexample, grains tend to be cheapest soon after the harvest, when thesupply is plentiful and the demand pretty well known. The spring210 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nplanting season, when the coming weather is uncertain, is the most\nlikely time for price spikes. Freezing spells in the northern parts of theUnited States are bullish for heating oil futures. Orange juice futuresused to have wild runups during the frosts in Florida, but have becomemuch more sedate with the growth of orange production in Brazil inthe Southern Hemisphere.\nFor some, seasonal trading degenerates into calendar trading.\nSpinning past data to find that a certain market should be bought dur-ing the first week of March and sold on the last week of August is amisuse of technology. It is easy to find what worked in the past, butany pattern that has no justification in the fundamentals or mass psy-chology probably is due to market noise. Seasonal trades take advan-tage of annual swings, but you have to be careful. They shift fromyear to year, and seasonal trades must be put through the filter of tech-nical analysis. \nOPENINTEREST All exchanges report trading volumes, but futures\nexchanges also report open interest, that is, the number of contracts out-standing on any given day, reported a day later. In the stock marketthe number of outstanding shares doesn’t change, unless a companyissues more or repurchases existing ones. In the futures markets, anew contract is created whenever a new buyer and a new seller cometogether. If both of them get out of their positions, a contract dis-appears. Open interest goes up and down each day, and its changesprovide important clues to the commitments of bulls and bears.\nEvery futures contract has a buyer and a seller, a winner and a loser.\nRising open interest shows more winners are coming into that market.Just as important, it shows more losers are coming in, because withouttheir money there would be nothing for winners to win. An uptrend inopen interest reflects a rising level of commitment on all sides and indi-cates that a trend is likely to continue. A downtrend in the open inter-est shows that winners are taking away their chips, while losers areaccepting losses and quitting the game. Falling open interest showsthat the trend is becoming weaker, which is a valuable piece of infor-mation when you need to decide whether to stay or take profits.\nSHORTING Few traders active today were in stocks in 1929, but the after-\nshocks of that year’s crash still impact us. The government respondedto the hue and cry of the hurt and angry public. Among its many actsTRADING 211\nwas an attempt to root out evil short sellers, accused of driving stocks\ndown. It promulgated the uptick rule, which allows shorting a stock\nonly after it has ticked up. The bad bears can no longer hammer downinnocent stocks with their sell orders. They may only sell short stocksthat are rising. How about a parallel law to outlaw buying stocks thathave ticked up and permitting people to buy only after a downtick, toprevent excessive bullishness?\nThe uptick rule is an example of a bad law passed in response to\nmass hysteria. It is short-sighted because during bear moves it is theshort sellers who break declines with their profit taking. There is nouptick rule in the futures markets. A futures trader is much more likelyto be comfortable shorting than a stock trader.\nIn stocks, most people are long and very few are short. Exchanges\nreport short interest each month, which almost never rises into doubledigits. In futures, short interest is always 100%—there is a short con-tract for every long because if someone is buying a contract for futuredelivery, someone else has to sell them a contract for future delivery,that is, go short. You have to feel comfortable shorting if you want totrade futures.\nLIMITMOVES Now that the stock market has its own “circuit breakers,”\nfewer newcomers to futures are shocked to discover that most havedaily limits beyond which prices are not allowed to go. Limits aredesigned to prevent hysterical moves and give people time to rethinktheir positions, but they have a downside. Just like a pedestrian can getcrushed against a traffic barricade put up to protect him, a trader canget crushed in a limit move. A string of limit days is especially terrify-ing, as a loser is stuck, unable to get out, while his account is beingdestroyed.\nFears of limit moves are greatly overdone. Their heyday was during\nthe inflationary 1970s, and the markets have become much morepeaceful since then. If you trade with the trend, a limit move is muchmore likely to go in your favor, not against. With the globalization ofthe futures markets, many more emergency exits appeared, allowingyou to unwind a trade elsewhere. A good trader learns to find thoseexits before he needs them. Last but not least, a futures trader mayconsider opening an “insurance account,” as recommended above fornaked options writers, albeit on a much smaller scale.212 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nMINICONTRACTS Futures traders with tiny accounts sometimes ask\nwhether they should trade regular contracts or minicontracts. Forexample, a regular contract of S&P represents $250 times the index,but a minicontract is only one-fifth its size, representing $50 timesthe index. In British pounds a regular contract represents £62,500, buta minicontract only one-fifth its size represents only £12,500. Mini-contracts trade during the same hours as regular contracts and closelytrack them in price.\nThe only advantage of minis is the reduction of risk, but their com-\nmissions take a bigger percentage from each trade. Beginners may usethem for practice, but full-size contracts are much better trading vehicles.\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE ?The Futures Game by Teweles and Jones\nhas educated several generations of futures traders.

Don’t tell me, just\nshow your trading records. Don’t have good records? Well, that’s\nan answer in itself. If you keep records, then the slope of your equitycurve will show how serious you are about trading.\nMost people enter the markets for the money, but soon loose track\nof that goal and start chasing some private version of fun. The tradinggame is a lot more interesting than solitaire and feeds dreams of wealthand power. People trade to escape boredom or show off their smarts.There are as many neurotic reasons to trade as there are traders, butonly one realistic one—to make more money than from riskless invest-ments, such as Treasury bills.\nSuccessful trading is based on 3 M’s: Mind, Method, and Money.\nMind is trading psychology, Method is market analysis, and Moneyrefers to risk management. This last M is your ultimate key to success.The slope of your equity curve, which you must draw as a part of yourmoney management process, reflects the state of your mind as well asthe quality of your method.\nAnyone can make money on a single trade or even several trades.\nEven in the casinos of Las Vegas you continuously hear the music ofthe jackpots. Coins pour from the slot machines, making a happynoise, but how many players go back to their rooms with more moneythan they came with? In the markets, almost anyone can make a goodtrade, but few can grow equity.\nMoney management is the craft of managing your trading capital.\nSome call it an art, others a science, but really it is a combination ofboth, with science predominating. The goal of money management isto accumulate equity by reducing losses on losing trades and maxi-\n215\nmizing gains on winning trades. When you cross the street after the\n“Walk” sign lights up, you still glance right and left because some crazeddriver may be barreling toward the crosswalk, sign or no sign. When-ever your trading system gives you a signal, money managementbecomes the equivalent of glancing right and left. Even the mostbeautiful trading system requires money management to make consis-\ntent profits.\nI once met a father and son team of successful money managers.\nThe father began grooming his son for the business while the boy wasstill a teenager. On weekends he used to take him to the track and givehis son $10 for the day. That was his lunch money and betting money.The father spent the day with his cronies, while the kid could come upand ask questions but never got another dollar. He had to make hismoney betting horses and manage his resources if he wanted to eatlunch that day. Learning to handicap horses (technical analysis), man-age his stake (money management), and wait for the best odds (psy-chology) paid off a million-fold after the son joined his father inmanaging a hedge fund.\nA good trading system gives you an edge in the market. To use a\ntechnical term, it provides a positive expectation over a long series oftrials. A good system ensures that winning is more likely than losingover a long series of trades. If your system can do that, you needmoney management, but if you have no positive expectation, noamount of money management will save you from losing.\nFor example, a roulette player has a negative expectation. A roulette\nwheel has 38 slots in the United States and 37 in Europe, but only 36are in play, as the house “owns” the remaining one or two. Since a slotrepresents roughly 2.7% of a wheel, over a period of time the houseskims that much from each game, slowly bleeding players dry. Thereis a primitive money management system called a martingale that has\nplayers start with a minimum bet, usually $1, and double up after eachloss, so that in theory, when they eventually win, they get back all theylost plus $1, and start with $1 again. Martingale does not work in reallife because casinos limit maximum bets. Once your loss runs up tothat limit, a martingale just hits its head on the ceiling and dies. Inblackjack, on the other hand, a very disciplined trader who follows atested strategy and counts cards has a slight edge over the casino, onthe order of 1 or 2 percent, sometimes higher. Here a good card counterneeds money management to keep bets small on iffy hands and dou-ble up on strong hands.216 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nOnce you have a trading system with a positive expectation, you\nmust establish money management rules. Follow them as if your lifedepended on them, because it does. When we lose money, we die astraders.\nWhatever percentage of capital you lose, you must make a greater per-\ncentage to come back. I used to carry a receipt from a car rental agencyto illustrate this point. The receipt showed a charge of $70, followed bya 10% discount, and 10% tax. What was the bottom line? If you said $70,go back to the books! $70 −10% =$63. $63 +10% =$69.30. If 10% is\ntaken away and 10% added, you end up below the starting point. Losingequity is like falling into an ice cave—it’s easy to slide in but hard to clawyour way out because the edges are slippery. What happens when atrader knocks his $10,000 account down to $6,600? He’s down 34% andmust make 50% just to come back to even. How likely is it that a traderwho just dropped a third of his equity will earn 50%? He’s at the bottomof an ice hole. He’ll either die or get a new lease on life from an outsidesource. The key question is whether he learns from his experience.\nMarkets are about as soft as a gladiator fight. Life on the battle-\nfield is m easured in money. Everybody’s fighting to take it away from\nyou—competitors, vendors, and brokers. Losing money is easy; makingit is hard.\nMoney management has two goals: survival and prosperity. The first\npriority is to survive, then to grind out steady gains, and finally, to makespectacular gains. Beginners tend to have those priorities reversed. Theyshoot for spectacular gains but never think about long-term survival.Putting survival first makes you focus on money management. Serioustraders are always focused on minimizing losses and growing equity.\nThe most successful money manager I know keeps saying he’s afraid\nof ending up as a taxi driver. His engineering degree is out of date, hehas no work experience outside the markets, and if he fails as a trader,all he can do is drive a cab. He’s made millions, but still does every-thing in his power to avoid losing money. He is one of the most dis-ciplined people I know. \nNOMATHILLITERATES\nModern society makes it easy to live without counting. Most of usrarely count, having grown accustomed to calculators and digitalscreens on appliances. If you can add up the number of guests at adinner party or figure out how many beers are left in a six-pack afterMONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 217\nyou have drunk two, you’re in good shape. It’s easy to go through life\nwith hardly any arithmetic. Not so in the markets.\nTrading is a numbers game. If you cannot count, you cannot trade.\nYou do not need calculus or algebra, but you must be on easy termswith basic math—adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. In addi-\ntion, you need to calculate percentages and fractions and round offnumbers in order to count fast. Also, you must be at ease with the con-cept of probability. This may sound simple, but it never ceases toamaze me how poorly and slowly most beginners count. All goodtraders are on easy terms with math. They are practical and sharp peo-ple who quickly calculate risks, results, and odds.\nWhat if you’re a product of modern education and need a calcula-\ntor to subtract 26.75 from 183.5 or figure out 15% of 320? You need toeducate yourself. You have to drill yourself in arithmetic. One of theeasiest ways to do so is by counting change when you go shopping.Estimate the total price. Once you give money to a cashier, calculatehow much change you’ll need. Figure out sales tax in your head. Keeppracticing, keep stepping out of the comfortable shell of modern con-sumer society where counting isn’t necessary. Read a couple of popu-lar books on the theory of probability.\nTroublesome? Yes. Time consuming? For sure. Learning to count on\nyour feet is not entertaining, but it’ll help you succeed in trading.\nHow wide is the channel? What is the ratio of the distances to your\nstop-loss and the profit target? If you want to risk no more than 1% ofyour account and the stop is 1.25 points away, how many shares mayyou buy? These and similar questions go to the heart of successful trad-ing. Being able to answer them on the fly gives you a real advantageover the crowd of innumerate amateurs.\nBUSINESSMAN ’SRISK VS . LOSS\nRemember our example of a small businessman who ran a fruit andvegetable stand, selling several crates each day? What if his wholesaleroffered him a crate of some new exotic fruit? He could make moneyon it, but if locals did not like the fruit and it rotted, a single cratewould not hurt his business. It is a normal businessman’s risk.\nNow imagine he bought a tractor-trailer of that fruit at a super low\nprice. If it sold, he could make a quick killing, but if that load rottedon him, it would hurt his business and could endanger his survival. Acrate presented an acceptable risk, but a truckload was a rotten risk.218 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nThe difference between a businessman’s risk and a loss is its size rel-\native to the size of your account.\nA businessman’s risk exposes you to normal equity fluctuation, but\na loss threatens your prosperity and survival. You must draw a linebetween them and never cross it. Drawing that line is a key task ofmoney management.\nWhenever you buy a stock and place a stop under it, you limit your\ndollar risk per share. Money management rules limit your total risk onany trade as a whole, allowing you to risk only a small percentage ofyour account. If you know your maximum permitted risk per trade aswell as your risk per share or contract, it is a matter of simple arith-metic to calculate how many shares or contracts you may trade.\nMoney management rules are essential for your survival and success.\nFew traders have the discipline to follow them. Promises are easy tomake while reading a book, but wait until you are in front of thescreen. “This time is different, it’s free money, I’ll give this trade a littleextra room.” The market seduces traders into breaking their rules. Willyou follow yours?\nI was recently invited to chair a panel on market psychology at a\ngathering of money managers. One of my panelists had nearly a billiondollars under management. A middle aged man, he started in businessin his 20s, while working for a naval consulting firm after graduateschool. Bored with his job, he designed a trading system but did nothave enough money to trade it because it required a minimum of$200,000. “I had to go to other people,” he said, “and ask them formoney. Once I explained to them what I was going to do and theygave me money, I had to stick to my system. It would have beenunconscionable to deviate from it. My poverty worked for me.” Povertyand integrity.\nIf you want to trade, you have to accept risks. A nitpicker, obsess-\ning over dimes, is too stiff to place orders. While you accept risks, youmay not accept losses. What is the definition of a loss?\nA loss is a violation of the percentage rules—the 2% and the 6% Rules.\nMarkets kill traders in one of two ways. If your equity is your life, amarket can snap it with a single shark bite, a disastrous loss that effec-tively takes you out of the game. It can also kill like a pack of pira-nhas, with a series of bites, none of which is lethal alone but whichtogether strip an account to the bone. These two money managementrules are designed to protect you from the sharks and the piranhas.MONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 219\nTHE2% S OLUTION —P ROTECTION FROM SHARKS\nUgly losses stick like sore thumbs out of most accounts. Traders who\nreview their records usually find that a single terrible loss or a shortstring of bad losses did most of the damage. Had they cut their lossessooner, their bottom line would have been much higher. Traders dreamof profits but often freeze like deer in the headlights when a losingtrade hits them. They need rules that tell them when to jump out ofharm’s way instead of waiting and praying for the market to turn.\nGood market analysis alone will not make you a winner. The ability\nto find good trades will not guarantee success. No amount of researchwill do you any good unless you protect yourself from the sharks. I’veseen traders make 20, 30, and once even 50 profitable trades in a row,and still end up losing money. When you’re on a winning streak, it’seasy to feel you’ve figured out the game. Then a disastrous loss wipesout all profits and tears into your equity. You need the shark repellentof good money management.\nA good system gives you an edge in the long run, but there is a great\ndeal of randomness in the markets, and any single trade is close to atoss-up. A good trader expects to be profitable by the end of the year,but ask him whether he’ll make money on his next trade and he’ll hon-estly say he doesn’t know. He uses stops to prevent losing trades fromhurting his account.\nTechnical analysis helps you decide where to place a stop, limiting\nyour loss per share. Money management rules help you protect youraccount as a whole. The single most important rule is to limit your losson any trade to a small fraction of your account.\nLimit your loss on any trade to 2% of equity in your trading account.\nThe 2% Rule refers only to your trading account. It doesn’t include yoursavings, equity in your house, retirement account, or money in theChristmas club. Your trading capital is the money you have dedicated totrading. This is your true risk capital, your equity in the trading enter-prise. It includes cash and cash equivalents in the account, plus today’smarket value of all open positions. Your system should make youmoney, while the 2% Rule lets you survive the inevitable drawdowns.\nSuppose you’re trading a $50,000 account. You want to buy XYZ\nstock, currently trading at $20. Your profit target is $26, with a stop at$18. How many shares of XYZ you are allowed to buy? Two percent220 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nof $50,000 is $1,000, the maximum risk you may accept. Buying at\n$20 and putting a stop at $18 means you’ll risk $2 per share. Dividethe maximum acceptable risk by the risk per share to find how manyshares you may buy. Dividing $1,000 by $2 gives you 500 shares. Thisis the maximum number, in theory. In practice, it has to be lowerbecause you must pay commissions and be prepared to be hit by slip-page, all of which must fit under the 2% limit. So, 400 rather than 500shares is the upper limit for this trade.\nI’ve noticed a curious difference in how people react to the 2% Rule.\nPoor beginners think this number is too low. Someone asked me at arecent conference whether the 2% Rule could be increased for smallaccounts. I answered that when he goes bungee jumping, it doesn’tpay to extend the cord.\nProfessionals, on the other hand, often say 2% is too high and they\ntry to risk less. A very successful hedge fund manager recently told methat his project for the next six months was to increase his trading size.He never risked more than 0.5% of equity on a trade—and was goingto teach himself to risk 1%! Good traders tend to stay well below the2% limit. Whenever amateurs and professionals are on the oppositesides of an argument, you know which side to choose. Try to risk lessthan 2%—it is simply the maximum level. \nWhenever you look at a potential trade, check whether a logical\nstop on a round lot or a single contract would keep you on theright side of the 2% Rule. If it would put more money at risk, pass\nthat trade.\nMeasure your account equity on the first of each month. If you start\nthe month with $100,000 in your account, the 2% Rule allows you torisk a maximum of $2,000 per trade. If you have a good month andyour equity rises to $105,000, then your 2% limit for the next monthis—how much? Quick! Remember, a good trader can count! If you have$105,000 in your account, the 2% Rule allows you to risk $2,100 andtrade a slightly bigger size. If, on the other hand, you have a badmonth and your equity falls to $95,000, the 2% Rule sets your maxi-mum permitted risk at $1,900 per trade for the following month. The2% Rule lets you expand when you are ahead and forces you to pullin your horns when you do poorly; it links your trading size to yourperformance. What if you have several trading accounts, for example,one for stocks and another for futures? In that case, apply the 2% Ruleto each account separately.MONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 221\nFutures—OK to Trade Spreadsheet\nImagine two traders, Mr. Hare and Mr. Turtle, both with $50,000\naccounts, who are looking at two futures markets—S&P 500 and corn.The agile Mr. Hare notices that the average daily range in the S&P isabout 5 points, worth $250 each. The daily range in corn is about 5cents, worth $50 each. He quickly figures that if he catches just a halfof a day’s range, he’ll make over $500 per contract in the S&P, whereasthe same level of skill will bring him just a little over $100 in corn. Mr.Hare calls his broker and buys two contracts of the S&P.\nThe cautious Mr. Turtle has a different arithmetic. He begins by set-\nting the maximum risk in his account at 2% or $1,000. Trading the S&P,moving over $1,000 a day with such a small account, is like grabbing avery large tiger by a very short tail. If, on the other hand, he trades corn,he’ll have a lot more staying power. That tiger is smaller and has a longertail, which he can wrap around his wrist. Mr. Turtle buys a contract ofcorn. Who is more likely to win in the long run, Mr. Hare or Mr. Turtle?\nTo find out which futures markets you may or may not trade, meas-\nure your equity against the recent level of market noise. Begin by cal-culating 2% of your account. Measure the level of noise with theSafeZone indicator, calculate its 22-day EMA, and translate that into dol-lars. Do not trade any market whose average noise level is more than1% of your equity. If you follow this rule, you’ll trade relatively sedatemarkets where you can safely place your stops. Why 1% and not 2%?Because your 2% stop will have to be more than the average noiselevel away from the market.\nThe first column in the spreadsheet in Table 7.1 lists the market, the\nsecond the value of one contract, the third the current SafeZone indi-cator, and the fourth multiplies SafeZone by two. The fifth column lists2% of the account value, in this case $30,000. The last column com-pares the value of SafeZone multiplied by two to 2% of the account. Ifthe latter is greater than the former, that market is OK to trade.\nThe values in Table 7.1 are current as this is being written, but have\nto be updated monthly because volatility changes and SafeZone with it.The exchanges occasionally modify contracts and change unit values.Use this table only as an example and a starting point. Do your home-work, plug in the current numbers, and find out which contracts youmay or may not trade.\nIf you cannot afford to trade a certain market, you can still download\nit, do your homework, and paper trade it as if you were doing it with222 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTable 7.1 OK to Trade Spreadsheet\nUnit 2% of OK to \nFuture value SafeZone SafeZone •2 $30,000 trade?\nBonds $1,000 0.33 $660 $600 No\nEuro$ $2,500 0.09 $450 $600 YesS&P $250 10.00 $5,000 $600 No\nSF $1,250 0.40 $1,000 $600 No\nJY $1,250 0.38 $950 $600 NoDM $1,250 0.26 $650 $600 NoC$ $1,000 0.21 $420 $600 Yes\nSugar $1,120 0.11 $246 $600 Yes\nCotton $500 0.63 $630 $600 NoCoffee $375 1.70 $1,275 $600 NoCocoa $10 24.00 $480 $600 Yes\nUnleaded $420 1.84 $1,546 $600 No\nHeating $420 2.11 $1,772 $600 NoCrude Oil $420 0.76 $638 $600 No\nSilver $5,000 0.09 $900 $600 No\nGold $100 1.80 $360 $600 YesCopper $250 1.05 $525 $600 Yes\nWheat $50 2.60 $260 $600 Yes\nCorn $50 2.50 $250 $600 YesBeans $50 6.50 $650 $600 NoBeanoil $600 0.30 $360 $600 Yes\nBeanmeal $100 2.60 $520 $600 Yes\nreal money. This will prepare you for the day when your account grows\nbig enough or the market grows quiet enough for you to jump in.\nTHE6% R ULE—P ROTECTION FROM PIRANHAS\nIt used to puzzle me why institutional traders as a group performedso much better than private traders. An average private trader is a 50-year-old married, college-educated man, often a business owner or aprofessional. You would think this thoughtful, computer-literate, book-reading individual would run circles around some loud 25-year-oldwith minimal training who used to play ball in college and hasn’t reada book since his junior year. In fact, the lifetime of most private tradersMONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 223\nis measured in months, while institutional traders continue to make\nmoney for their firms year after year. Is it because of their fast reflexes?Not really, because young private traders wash out just as fast as olderones. Nor do institutional traders win because of training, which isskimpy in most firms.\nInstitutional traders who make a lot of money sometimes decide to\ngo out on their own. They quit the firm, lease the same gear, tradethe same system, stay in touch with their contacts—and fail. A fewmonths later, most cowboys are back in head-hunters’ offices, lookingfor a trading job. How come they make money for the firms but not forthemselves?\nWhen an institutional trader quits his firm, he leaves behind his man-\nager, the person in charge of discipline and risk control. That managersets the maximum risk per trade for each trader. That is similar to whata private trader can do with the 2% Rule. Firms operate from huge cap-ital bases, and the risk limit is much higher in dollar terms but tiny inpercentage terms. A trader who violates that limit is fired. A privatetrader can break the 2% Rule and hide it, but a manager watches histraders like a hawk. A private trader can throw confirmation slips in ashoebox, but a trading manager quickly gets rid of impulsive people.He saves institutional traders from disastrous losses, which destroymany private accounts.\nIn addition, a trading manager sets the maximum allowed monthly\ndrawdown for each trader. When an employee sinks to that level, histrading privileges are suspended for the rest of the month. We all gothrough cycles. Sometimes we’re in gear with the markets, and every-thing we touch turns to gold. At other times we are out of sync, andeverything we touch turns into a completely different substance. Youmay think you’re hot, but when you keep losing, it is the market’s wayof saying you’re cold.\nMost private traders on a losing streak keep trying to trade their\nway out of a hole. A loser thinks a successful trade is just aroundthe corner, and that his luck is about to turn. He keeps putting on more\ntrades and increases his size, all the while digging himself a deeperhole in the ice. The sensible thing to do would be to reduce your trad-ing size and then stop and review your system. A trading managerbreaks his traders’ losing streaks by forcing them to stop after theyreach their monthly loss limit. Imagine being in a room with co-workerswho are actively trading, while you sharpen pencils and run out for224 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nsandwiches. Traders do all in their power to avoid being in that spot.\nThis social pressure creates a serious incentive not to lose.\nA friend who used to manage a trading department in London had a\nwoman on his team who was a very good trader. Once, she hit a losingstreak and by the middle of the month was nearing her loss limit. Myfriend knew he would have to suspend her trading privileges, but shewas very high-strung and he did not want to hurt her feelings. He founda course on treasury management in Washington, DC, and sent her therefor the rest of the month. Most managers are not so gentle. Gentle orrough, the monthly loss limit saves traders from death by piranha bites—a nasty series of small losses that can add up to a disaster.\nThe piranha is a tropical river fish, not much bigger than a man’s hand,\nbut with a mean set of teeth. It doesn’t look very dangerous, but if adog, a person, or a donkey stumbles into a tropical stream, a pack ofpiranhas can attack him with such a mass of bites that the victim col-lapses. A bull can walk into a river, get attacked by piranhas, and a fewminutes later only its skeleton will be bobbing in the water. A traderkeeps sharks at bay with the 2% Rule, but he still needs pro tection from\nthe piranhas. The 6% Rule will save you from being nibbled to death.\nWhenever the value of your account dips 6% below its closing value\nat the end of last month, stop trading for the rest of this month.Calculate your equity each day, including cash, cash equivalents, andcurrent market value of all open positions in your account. Stop trad-ing as soon as your equity dips 6% below where it stood on the lastday of the previous month. Close all positions that may still be openand spend the rest of that month on the sidelines. Continue to moni-tor the markets, keep track of your favorite stocks and indicators, andpaper trade if you wish. Review your trading system. Was this losingstreak just a fluke or did it expose a flaw in your system?\nPeople who leave institutions know how to trade, but their disci-\npline is external, not internal. They quickly lose money without theirmanagers. Private traders have no managers. This is why you needyour own system of discipline. The 2% Rule will save you from a dis-astrous loss, while the 6% Rule will save you from a series of losses.The 6% Rule forces you to do something most people cannot do ontheir own—stop losing streaks.\nUsing the 6% Rule, along with the 2% Rule, is like having your own\ntrading manager. Let us review an example of trading using these rules.MONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 225\nFor simplicity’s sake, let us assume we’ll risk 2% of equity on any given\ntrade, even though in reality we try to risk less.\nAt the end of the month, a trader calculates his equity and finds that he\nhas $100,000 and no open positions. He writes down his maximumrisk levels for the month ahead: 2% or $2,000 per trade and 6% or$6,000 for the account as a whole.\nSeveral days later the trader sees a very attractive stock, A, figures out\nwhere to put his stop, and buys a position that puts $2,000, or 2% ofhis equity, at risk.\nA few days later he sees stock B and puts on a similar trade, risking\nanother $2,000.\nBy the end of the week he sees stock C and buys it, risking another $2,000.The next week he sees stock D, which is more attractive than any of the\nthree above. Should he buy it? No, because his account is alreadyexposed to 6% risk. He has three open trades, risking 2% on each, andhe may lose 6% if the market goes against him. The 6% Rule prohibitshim from risking any more at this time.\nA few days later, stock A rallies and the trader moves his stop above\nbreakeven. Stock D, which he was not allowed to trade just a few daysago, still looks very attractive. May he buy it now? Yes, he may, becausehis current risk is only 4% of his account. He is risking 2% in stock B andanother 2% in stock C, but nothing in stock A, because its stop is abovebreakeven. The trader buys stock D, risking another $2,000, or 2%.\nLater in the week, the trader sees stock E, and it looks very bullish. May\nhe buy it? Not according to the 6% Rule, because his account is alreadyexposed to a 6% risk in stocks B, C, and D (he is no longer risking anyequity in stock A). He must pass up stock E.\nA few days later stock B falls and hits its stop. Stock E still looks attrac-\ntive. May he buy it? No, since he already lost 2% on stock B and has a4% exposure to risk in stocks C and D. Adding another position at thistime would expose him to more than 6% risk per month.\nThe 6% Rule protects you from the piranhas. When they start biting\nyou, get out of the water, and do not let the nasty fish nibble you todeath. You may have more than three positions at once if you risk lessthan 2% per trade. If you risk only 1% of your account equity, you mayopen six positions before maxing out at the 6% limit. The 6% Rule pro-tects your equity, based on last month’s closing value and not takinginto account any additional profits you may have made this month.226 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nIf you come into a new month with a big open profit, you have to re-\ncalibrate your stops and sizes so that no more than 2% of your new totalequity level is exposed to risk on any given trade and no more than 6%on all open trades combined. Whenever you do well and the value ofyour account rises by the end of the month, the 6% Rule will allow youto trade a bigger size the following month. If you do poorly and the sizeof your account shrinks, it will reduce your trading size the next month.\nThe 6% Rule encourages you to increase your size when you’re on\na winning streak and stop trading early in a losing streak. If the mar-kets move in your favor, you will move your stops beyond breakevenand put on more positions. If your stocks or futures start going againstyou and hitting stops, you will lose your maximum permitted amountfor the month and stop, saving the bulk of your account to trade thenext month.\nThe 2% Rule and the 6% Rule provide guidelines for pyramiding—\nadding to winning positions. If you buy a stock, it rises, and you movethe stop above breakeven, then you may buy more of the same stock,as long as the risk on the new position is no more than 2% of youraccount equity and your total account risk is less than 6%. Handle eachaddition as a separate trade.\nMost traders go through emotional swings, feeling elated at the highs\nand gloomy at the lows. If you want to be a disciplined trader, the 2%and the 6% Rules will convert your good intentions into the reality ofsafer trading.\nPOSITION SIZING\nA few years ago the owner of a local stock trading firm asked me to runa psychological training group for his traders. They were shocked tohear a psychiatrist was coming and loudly insisted they “weren’t crazy.”The group got off the ground only after the manager told his worst per-formers that they had to join—or else. Once we began to meet andfocus on psychology and money management, the results were suchthat six weeks later we had a waiting list for the second group.\nThe firm used a proprietary day-trading system. It worked so well that\nits two top traders took in more than a million dollars each month. Otherswho used the same system made less, and quite a few lost money.\nIn one of our first meetings a trader complained that he had lost\nmoney each day for the past 13 days. His manager, who sat in on theMONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 227\nmeeting, confirmed that the fellow was following the firm’s system but\ncould not make any money. I began by saying that I would take myhat off for anyone who could lose for 13 days in a row and have theintestinal fortitude to come in and trade the next morning. I then askedhow many shares he traded, since the firm set a maximum for eachtrader. He was permitted to buy or sell 700 shares at a clip, but volun-tarily reduced it to 500 while on his losing streak.\nI told him to drop down to 100 shares until he had two weeks dur-\ning which he had more winning days than losing and was profitableoverall. Once he cleared that hurdle, he could go up to 200 shares.Then, after another two-week profitable period, he could go up to 300shares, and so on. He was allowed a 100-share increment after twoweeks of profitable trading. If he had a single losing week, he’d have todrop back to the previous level until he had a new profitable two-weekperiod. In other words, he had to start small, go up in size slowly, anddrop down fast in case of trouble.\nThe trader loudly objected that 100 shares weren’t enough, and he\nwouldn’t be able to make any money. I told him to stop kidding him-self since trading a bigger size made him no money either, and hereluctantly agreed to my plan. When we met a week later he reportedthat he had four profitable days out of five and was profitable overall.He made very little money because his trading size was so small, buthe was ahead of the game. He continued to make money during thenext week and then stepped up to 200 shares. In our next meeting heasked, “Do you think it could be psychological?” The group roared.Why would a man lose while trading 500 shares, but make money trad-ing 100 or 200?\nI took a $10 bill out of my pocket and asked whether anyone in that\ngroup would like to earn it by climbing on top of our long narrow con-ference table and walking from one end to the other. Several handswent up. Wait, I said, I have a better offer. I’ll give $1,000 cash to any-one who comes up with me up to the roof of our 10-story office build-ing and uses a board as wide as the table to walk to the roof of another10-story building across the boulevard. No volunteers.\nI started egging on the group. “The board will be as wide and sturdy\nas our conference table, we’ll do it on a windless day, and I’ll pay$1,000 cash on the spot. The technical challenge is no harder thanwalking on the conference table, but the reward is much greater.” Stillno takers. Why? Because if you lose your balance on the conference228 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\ntable, you jump down a couple of feet and land on the carpet. If you\nlose your balance between two rooftops, you would be splattered onthe asphalt.\nWhen the level of risk goes up, our ability to perform goes down.Beginners often make money on small trades. They gain a little\nexperience and confidence, increase their trading size—and start los-ing. Their system hasn’t changed, but bigger size makes them a littlestiffer and less nimble. Most beginners are in a hurry to make a killing,and guess who gets killed.\nOvertrading means, among other things, trading a size that is too\nlarge for you. Poor futures traders look for brokers with the lowestmargin requirements. If the minimum margin in gold is $2,000, aneager beaver with $10,000 may buy five contracts. Each includes 100 oz.of gold, making his account swing $500 for every $1 move in gold. Ifgold goes against him, he is cooked. If it goes his way, that beginnerwill be convinced he has discovered a great new way of makingmoney, continue to trade recklessly, and bust out on the next trade.\nUnscrupulous brokers promote overtrading because it generates big\ncommissions. Some stockbrokers outside the United States offer a “shoul-der” of 10:1, allowing you to buy $10 worth of stock for every $1 youdeposit with the firm. Some currency houses offer a shoulder of 100:1.\nWhen a scuba diver jumps off a boat, he has a device called an\noctopus attached to his air tank. It consists of several tubes, one lead-\ning to his mouthpiece, another to his flotation vest, and yet another toan instrument that shows how much air he has left in his tank. If it fallstoo low, he may not have enough to get back to the surface, which iswhy scuba is such a deadly sport for illiterates and hotheads.\nPutting on a trade is like diving for treasure. There is gold below the\nrocks on the ocean floor. As you scoop it up, remember to glance atyour air gauge. How much gold can you take without endangeringyour survival? The ocean floor is littered with the remains of diverswho saw great opportunities.\nA professional diver thinks about his air supply first. If he doesn’t\nget any gold today, he’ll go for it tomorrow. All he needs to do is sur-vive and dive again. Beginners kill themselves by running out of air.The lure of free gold is too strong. Free gold! It reminds me of aRussian saying—the only free thing is the cheese in a mousetrap.\nThere are tribes in Africa that catch monkeys by putting tidbits\nof food into jars with narrow necks, tied to stakes in the ground.MONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 229\nA monkey wiggles its hand into a jar, grabs a tidbit, but cannot pull\nit out because only an open hand can go through the narrow neck.The monkey still tugs at the bait when the hunters come to pickit up. Monkeys lose because of greed, grabbing and refusing to letgo. Think of this when you feel tempted to put on a large trade withno stop.\nA professional trader needs strong money management skills. All\nsuccessful traders survive and prosper thanks to their discipline. The2% Rule will keep you safe from the sharks, the 6% Rule from the pira-nhas. Then, if you have a half-way decent trading system, you’ll be farahead of the game.\nMONEY MANAGEMENT STEPS\nOvertrading—putting on trades that are too large for your account—isa deadly mistake. Beginners are in a hurry to make money, whereasserious traders begin by measuring risks. If you start small and con-centrate on quality, you’ll become a better trader. Once you’ve learnedto trade—find trades, enter, set stops and profit targets, and exit—youcan start increasing your trading size to the point where your accountstarts generating a meaningful income.\nA new trader came to see me recently, a 42-year-old businessman\ntired of the rat race. His wife continued to run their business, while heput all his time and energy into the market. He kept bobbing aroundbreakeven, trading anywhere from 100 to 1,000 shares at a clip. Often,he’d make money on several trades in a row trading small lots andthen give back everything on a single large trade.\nI told him he was ahead of the game because, unlike most begin-\nners, he hadn’t lost money. I then gave him the standard prescription—begin by trading 100 shares, the smallest round lot, until you have aprofitable period during which you have more winners than losers andare profitable overall. That period should be two weeks for a day-trader or two months for a longer-term swing trader. Once you havehad a profitable period, bump up your size by 100 shares and starttrading 200. After another profitable period, go up another 100 sharesand start trading 300. If you have a losing half-period (a week for aday-trader, a month for a swing trader), go back down to your previ-ous trade size and start counting again. If you trade futures, substituteone contract for 100 shares. Advance slowly, retreat fast.230 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nIn his ground-breaking book Portfolio Management Formulas , Ralph\nVince introduced the concept of the optimal f—the optimal fraction of\nyour account to risk in any given trade for maximum long-term gains.His book is mathematically demanding, but it boils down to a few keyconcepts: there is an optimal ffor every trade; if you bet less, your risk\ndecreases arithmetically while profit decreases geometrically; if youkeep betting more than the optimal f, you are guaranteed to go broke.\nThe optimal fkeeps shifting with every trade and is hard to calcu-\nlate. It provides the highest returns in the long run, but it also leads tovicious drawdowns that may exceed 90% of the account. Who has thefortitude to continue trading a system that has brought his accountdown from $100,000 to $9,000? The main value of the optimal fis sim-\nply to remind us that if we trade a size that’s too large, we’ll destroyour account. The optimal fmarks the zone beyond which you walk\ninto a minefield. Stay away from it, trade less than the optimal f.\nBeginners who count profits put their cart before the horse. Reverse\nthat approach and begin by counting risks. Ask yourself what yourmaximum permitted risk is if you follow the 2% and 6% Rules.\nThese are the steps of proper money management:\n1.Measure your account value on the first of the month—the total\nof cash, cash equivalents, and open positions.\n2.Calculate 2% of your equity. This is the maximum you may risk\non any given trade.\n3.Calculate 6% of your equity. This is the maximum you are per-\nmitted to lose in any given month, after which you must close outall trades and stop trading for the rest of that month.\n4.For every trade, decide on your entry point and a stop; express\nyour risk per share or per contract in dollars.\n5.Divide 2% of your equity by your risk per share to find how\nmany shares or contracts you may trade. To get a round number,round it down.\n6.Calculate your risk on all open positions by multiplying the dis-\ntance from the entry point to the current stop by the number ofshares or contracts. If the total risk is 4% of your account or less,you may add another position, since you’ll be adding 2% withyour current trade, bringing the total to 6%. Remember, you donot have to risk 2% per trade; you may risk less if you like.\n7.Put on a trade only after meeting all of the above conditions.MONEY MANAGEMENT FORMULAS 231\nEstablish the size of your trades on the basis of how much money you\ncan afford to risk, not how much you want to make. Follow the 2%and the 6% Rules. If you are having a good month, with most tradesgoing your way, you will move your stops beyond breakeven andwill be allowed to put on more positions. You may even go on mar-gin. The beauty of this money management system is that it clips yourlosses when you are cold and lets you go forward at full throttle whenyou’re hot.\nOn the first of the month, if you have no open positions, the 2% and\n6% levels are easy to calculate. If you approach the first of the monthwith some open positions, calculate your account equity—the value ofall open trades at the latest market price plus all cash or money mar-ket funds. Calculate the 2% and 6% levels on the basis of that number.If you have moved stops beyond breakeven in open trades, you haveno capital at risk and may look for new trades. If your stops are notyet at breakeven, find the percentage of your equity you have exposedto risk and count it against the 6%. Once you deduct that number from6%, the result will let you know whether you may put on new trades.\nHow should you apply the 2% and 6% Rules if you trade futures,\nstocks, and options all at the same time? First of all, a beginner shouldconcentrate on a single market. Diversify only after you succeed. If youare trading more than one market, open separate accounts and treat eachas a separate trading enterprise. For example, if you have $60,000 instocks and $40,000 in futures, calculate the 2% and 6% Rules for the$60,000 and apply them to stocks, and then calculate the 2% and 6%Rules for the $40,000 and apply them to futures. If you have more thanone account, allocate trading-related expenses in proportion to their sizes.\nRemember, both your trading system and your money management\nmust be good in order to win in the markets.232 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING\nPART\nTHREE\nCOME INTO \nMY TRADINGROOM\nTraders go through several stages of development. Many beginners view\ntrading as a mechanical pursuit. They think that if only they could findthe right parameters for the Stochastic or the proper length for a mov-ing average, success would be theirs. They become easy prey for gurusselling mechanical systems.\nSurvivors realize that psychological factors, such as optimism or\ndoubt, greed or the fear of pulling the trigger are much more impor-tant than any technical indicator. They start developing a feel for theimportance of risk control. I keep running into folks at conferenceswho have a good grip on technical analysis and some understandingof psychology, but who know that something is missing because theycannot win consistently and must keep their day jobs. What shouldthey do next?\nOnce you have a decent understanding of technical analysis, follow\nmoney management rules, and know the value of trading psychology,you need to develop new organizational skills. You already possess thebuilding blocks of success—now is the time to erect the structure ofsuccessful trading.\nThere is no magic trick for converting a serious amateur into a pro-\nfessional trader. What I offer you here is a recipe for intense andfocused work which will enable you to move up to the ultimate stageof professional trading.\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nCHAPTER\nEIGHT\nTHE ORGANIZED TRADER\nWhat is the single most important trait of a successful trader? High\nintelligence? Not really, even though some basic level of per-\nformance is required. Good education? Not quite, since many of thebest traders haven’t gone past high school. The trait that all winnershave in common is a very high level of discipline. How can you meas-ure your level and then increase it? You do it by maintaining and learn-ing from several sets of trading records.\nKeeping good records is the single most important contribution to\nyour success. If you maintain scrupulous records, review them, andlearn from them, your performance will improve. If your money man-agement is in place to ensure survival during the learning process,you’re sure to become a success.\nThese are strong words, but my experience confirms them. In the\nyears of teaching Traders’ Camps, whenever I saw a person with goodrecords, he was either a successful trader or soon became one. I havefound that women tend to keep better records than men, which is oneof the reasons the percentage of winners among them is higher.\nRecords are more important to your success than any indicator,\nsystem, or technical tool. Even the best system is bound to have someholes, but good records will allow you to find them and plug them up.A person who keeps detailed records makes a huge leap in his devel-opment as a trader.\nShow me a trader with good records, and I’ll show you a good\ntrader.\nBad traders keep bad records. People who do not learn from the\npast are doomed to repeat it. “I’ve been hit, insulted, spat upon, andabused—the only reason I stick around is to see what happens next.”\n235\nGood records let you learn from the past instead of struggling from day\nto day. When the market hits you, good records show from where thatblow came. The next time, you’ll take a different path and avoid trou-ble. You may run into a different sort of trouble the next time around,but keep at it long enough and you’ll run out of mistakes. Just be sureyour money management is in place, so that your money doesn’t runout while you are learning. When you start making profits, yourrecords will show how they came about, helping you repeat that expe-rience. Good records reduce guesswork and make trading a muchmore professional exercise.\nRemember the extensive notes you kept in college? Educators agree\nthat keeping notes is an essential part of the learning process. If youare struggling, you must start keeping notes. Once you become a win-ner, you’ll continue to keep them, because they will have become akey part of your trading process. Keeping records is time-consuming.If you get tired or bored and give them up, take that as a sure sign thatyou are gambling rather than trading. Your records are a litmus test ofyour seriousness as a trader.\nA trader needs four types of records. Three of them look back, and\none forward. The trader’s spreadsheet, his equity curve, and his trad-ing diary help review past performance. The spreadsheet rates eachindividual trade, the equity curve tracks your account as a whole, andthe diary reflects your decision-making process. The fourth record is atrading plan for the day ahead. Maintaining these four records puts youon the road toward responsible, professional, successful trading.\nTRADER ’SSPREADSHEET\nThe first step of proper record keeping is setting up a spreadsheet thatlists all your trades. Each horizontal line describes a new trade. Eachvertical column contains a certain detail of each trade or rates an aspectof your performance. These columns belong in any workable trader’sspreadsheet:\n1.Trade number (list all trades in the order of entry)\n2.Entry date\n3.Long or short\n4.Ticker (stock symbol)236 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\n5.Size (how many shares)\n6.Entry price\n7.Commission\n8.Fee\n9.Total (Entry price ×size +commission +fee)\n10.Channel (record the height of the channel on the daily chart or\nwhatever chart you use for your intermediate timeframe; you’lluse it to rate your trade after exiting)\n11Exit date\n12.Exit price\n13.Commission\n14.Fee\n15.Total (Exit price ×size −commission −fee)\n16.P/L (profit or loss—column 15 minus column 9 for longs or the\nopposite for shorts)\n17.Entry grade (see below)\n18.Exit grade (see below)\n19.Trade grade (see below)\nYou may include several additional columns. For example, you may\nwant to record the name of the system that prompted that trade, theinitial stop, and slippage, if any. You can make your spreadsheet reflectmultiple exits as well as record the reasons for exits, such as hittingprice targets or stops, or impatience. You can make your spreadsheetgive you quick summaries of profit and loss or the number of winningand losing trades per market and per system. You can make it showthe average, the smallest, and the greatest profit or loss per trade ineach market and each system.\nThe entry grade (17) rates the quality of your entry by expressing it\nas a percentage of that day’s range. For example, if the high of the daywas 80, the low 76, and you bought at 77, then your entry grade is 25,meaning you bought within the lower 25% of the day’s range. Had youbought at 78, your grade would have been 50. The lower the percent-age while buying, the better. Consistently buying at high numbers canbe ruinous. Try to keep your entry rating below 50. This may not seemlike much, but can be surprisingly difficult to accomplish.\nThe exit grade (18) rates the quality of your exit by expressing it as\na percentage of that day’s range. For example, if the high of the dayTHE ORGANIZED TRADER 237\nwas 88, the low 84, and you sold at 87, your exit grade is 75. It means\nyou captured 75% of that day’s range. Had you sold at 86, your gradewould have been 50. The higher the percentage, the better for theseller. Selling at high numbers is good, while selling at low numbersamounts to charity. Work to get your exit rating above 50.\nThese ratings are important for position traders but even more so for\nday-traders. Just keep in mind that when shorting, you open a trade byselling and close it by buying. Similar ratings apply, as long as youkeep in mind that the sequence of buying and selling is reversed.\nThe trade grade (19) expresses your profit as a percentage of the\nchannel you’ve captured. It is the single most important rating of acompleted trade, much more important than the amount of profit.Subtract column 6 (entry price) from column 12 (exit price) and dividethe result by column 10 (channel width), displaying the result in per-centage format. Reverse the formula when you go short—column 6minus column 12 divided by column 10.\nRating your profit as a percentage of the channel provides an objec-\ntive yardstick of your performance. You can make a lot of money in abig sloppy trade or just a little money in a finely executed trade in adifficult market. Rating each trade on the basis of its channel reflectsyour skill as a trader. If you can capture between 10% and 20% of thechannel, your grade is a C. If your profit exceeds 20% of the channelwidth, you earn a B. And when you take 30% or more out of a chan-nel, you make an A trade!\nAdd an extra column following each rating to calculate your average\ngrades for entries, exits, and completed trades. Graph those numbersand keep doing everything you can to make them trend higher. Ascrupulously maintained trader’s spreadsheet is an active learning tool.It puts you in touch with your successes and failures, creating an islandof stability and responsibility in the ocean of market chaos.\nTHEEQUITY CURVE\nAre you disciplined enough to succeed in trading? Few people can def-initely answer yes or no. Many traders are somewhere in the middle ofthe scale. There is a gauge, a meter that shows whether you’re movingup or down as a trader. That gauge is your account equity. Wheneveryou act responsibly, it turns up, but ticks down with almost every lapseof judgment.238 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nMost traders look at charts, but very few look at themselves. That is\nan oversight, since personality is a hugely important part of trading. Anequity curve holds up a mirror to your performance. Professionals keepequity charts for themselves and their clients. When you start trackingyour equity curve, you make a big step toward joining the pros.\nUse a spreadsheet to track your equity curve. Each horizontal line\nreflects one unit of time, in this case a month. These columns belongin the spreadsheet:\n1.Date\n2.Account equity\n3.2%\n4.6%\nFind your account equity on the last day of each month and type in\nthat figure. Account equity equals all cash and cash equivalents in theaccount, plus the value of all open positions. Mark your account tomarket; your account equity is the liquidation value of your account.Repeat this procedure every month. After accumulating this data forseveral months, begin plotting your equity on a chart. The goal of everyprofessional trader is a smoothly rising equity curve, flowing from thelower left to the upper right with only occasional shallow drawdowns.\nOnce you have accumulated a year’s worth of equity data, add a\nmoving average to your curve. A six-month simple MA will identify thetrend of your equity. It will also answer an important question—whento add money to your account.\nMost people add capital either after damaging losses or when they\nfeel very confident after a string of successes. Adding money after yourequity reaches a new high is emotionally understandable, but it hap-pens to be a bad time to add money. We all go through cycles, and atrader who has just reached a new equity high is due for a pause or apullback. If the moving average of your equity is rising, the best timeto add money is on a pullback to the rising MA. The uptrend of themoving average of your equity confirms that you are a good trader, anda pullback shows a return to value. You buy stocks and futures on pull-backs to their EMAs, so why not use the same tactic when you wantto give yourself more money to trade?\nProgram your spreadsheet to return two important numbers after\nyou type in that month’s equity—the 2% and 6% values. They set twosafety nets for your account for the month ahead. The 2% Rule limitsTHE ORGANIZED TRADER 239\nyour risk on any single trade. Once you find a trade and decide where\nto put a stop, the 2% Rule will give you the maximum number ofshares or contracts you may trade (try to risk less if you can). The 6%Rule takes away your trading privileges for the balance of the month ifyour account value drops to 94% of its previous month-end level.\nYou may enhance this spreadsheet, depending on what you want to\nknow and how good you are at programming. You can use it to cal-culate the monthly curve with and without interest. You can calculateyour curve both before and after trading expenses. You need to recal-culate your curve whenever you add or subtract trading capital with-out mixing up past percentages. The key message—start plotting yourequity curve now!\nYour equity curve is the yardstick of your performance. An orderly\nuptrend is better than a steep uptrend with deep drawdowns. Yourequity curve should keep rising, and if it turns down, you have tobecome much more defensive in your trading.\nTRADING DIARY\nA civilized person is in touch with his past. Understanding what hasgone before helps you deal with the present and face the future. Atrader who keeps a diary can learn from the past instead of mindlesslyrepeating mistakes. A trading diary provides a private mirror, a valu-able feedback loop. It is probably the single best learning tool avail-able to traders.\nA trading diary is both a visual and written record of your trades.\nYou can keep it on paper or in electronic form. I started keeping minesuch a long time ago that I still do it on paper, using scissors anddouble-stick tape to paste up charts. You can follow these instructionsor adjust them and convert your diary into electronic format.\nA trading diary is an album, 11 × 14 inches or bigger. Assign each two-\npage spread to a single trade. Whenever you enter a trade, print out thecharts that led to that trade, and paste them on the left page. Each chartis about 3 × 5 inches, with the weekly on top, followed by one or two\ndailies and sometimes an intraday chart. Write down the name of thestock, the date, and the number of shares bought or shorted. Add a noteon the fundamentals if they had anything to do with that trade. Commenton how you first became aware of that stock—a scan of the database, a240 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\ntip from a friend, or an article in a magazine or a newsletter. This allows\nyou to track the sources of your information. Use a pen to mark indica-tor signals and chart patterns that led you into that trade. Write a fewwords about your feelings entering that trade (anxious, happy, confi-dent, unsure) and note any unusual factors and circumstances.\nI keep my diary at home, and if I trade at the office, I bring my\nprintouts with me and paste them up in the evening. It takes time toclip the charts, tape them into my album, mark them up, and write thecommentary. This discipline reminds me that trading is what I do, andtrading takes priority over almost all other activities.\nRepeat this process after exiting a trade—print out the charts and\npaste them up on the right page of the album. There are usually fewercharts on the right, as the weekly chart does not always figure in theexit. Mark up trading signals and write down your comments on the cir-cumstances of the exit, including your feelings about it.\nAs your diary grows thicker, this visual record of your trades be-\ncomes more and more valuable. Keep going back, leafing through yourdiary. How do those signals look now? What are you happy with, whatwould you have done differently, what lessons have you learned? Mosttraders never ask themselves these questions. When they make money,they swell with pride, and when they lose, they feel angry or ashamed.Wallowing in feelings will not make you a better trader. Our losses canteach us more than our gains. A trading diary helps you put aside self-kicking or self-congratulation and pay attention to the facts. It helpsyou learn and succeed, helps you become free.\nNobody can give you a trading diary. You have to create it yourself,\nand your ability to maintain it will provide a running check of yourdiscipline. Whenever you make some money, leaf through your diaryand ask whether you could have done any past trades differently inlight of what you have just learned. When you lose, do not kick your-self but write a good note on that trade, go back to review past trades,and think how to avoid such losses in the future. Learn from your prof-its and losses.\nTo learn even more, go back to each completed trade approximately\nthree months after an exit and print out the current charts. Tape themto a sheet of paper, mark them up, and attach that flyleaf to your exitpage. Now you can revisit your trades with the benefit of hindsight foran extra dose of trading education.THE ORGANIZED TRADER 241\nWhat if you are a very active trader or day-trader, making so many\ntrades that a diary entry for each is simply impractical? In that case,have a diary entry for every fifth or every tenth trade listed in yourTrader’s Spreadsheet. You can add other trades to your diary if they areespecially important, but be sure to maintain the discipline of everyfifth or every tenth trade.\nKeeping a diary and learning from your trades is as close as you can\ncome to a guarantee of trading success. Be sure to strictly observemoney management rules so that a string of freak losses doesn’t tossyou out of the game while you’re still learning. Follow the rules, keepa spreadsheet, equity chart, and a trading diary, review them, learn fromthem, and you’ll have everything it takes to become a successful trader.\nACTION PLAN\nIt is important to face each day knowing what and how you will trade.This is especially true for position traders, as day-traders must instantlyreact to quotes on their screens.\nA pro does not squint at his charts. Good trades jump at you from\nthe chart and scream—here I am, take me. If you have to squint, thereis no trade and you should move on to the next stock. A good posi-tion trader, or any mature trader for that matter, looks not for the chal-lenges but for the money.\nThe best time to search is in the evenings when markets are closed.\nYou can review your markets in peace, think, check out other stocksand indicators, and then make your decision—to go long, short, orstand aside. Write down your decision and review it in the morningbefore the markets open.\nWhenever you place an order, especially when you give it to the bro-\nker on the phone, it pays to read from a page instead of speaking frommemory. Why? Because almost every trader I know has had the embar-rassing experience, usually more than once, of accidentally reversing anorder. You may want to sell short, but make a slip of the tongue, tellingyour broker to buy, and seconds later find yourself an owner of a col-lapsing stock. Even worse, there is a temptation to change your orderat the last moment—buy more or less than you planned, or switch alimit to a market order. Putting a sheet of paper between yourself andyour broker provides a useful layer of protection.242 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nIt is a good idea to write down some background for each order.\nMy preferred format includes three lines: Weekly, Daily, and To Do.For example:\nWeekly: EMA rising, MACD-H ticked down, deteriorating\nDaily: MACD-H bearish divergence, pullback to the EMA in progressTo Do: Sell short at 71.30 with a stop at 73, target mid-60s\norWeekly: EMA turning flat, MACD-H ticked up from a bullish divergence\nDaily: EMA up, MACD-H rising, all in gear to the upsideTo Do: Buy on a pullback to the EMA at 23.25, stop 22, target high 20s\nI keep these notes in an Excel spreadsheet. It has a line for every\nstock that I track, with dates in vertical columns. Whenever I see atrade, I click on the cell for that date and stock, go to the Insert menu,and select Comment. Once I’ve written my three-line note, a tiny redtriangle appears in the right upper corner of the cell. Whenever youmove your cursor over it, the comment pops up on the screen. Thisrecord-keeping system makes it easy to sweep horizontally and reviewyour entire analytic history of a stock or sweep vertically and reviewall your comments for that day. I keep my records for the ABC ratingsystem, described below, in the same spreadsheet.\nRemember to keep your notes descriptive. If you write something\nlike “weekly charts give a buy signal,” that does not tell you anythingspecific about a stock and will be useless when you look at it a fewdays later. Begin by describing what you see on the weekly charts,move on to the dailies, and only after that write down your tradingideas on the action line.\nKeeping an action plan increases your load of paperwork, but it\nmakes trading more businesslike and less like a swing through acasino. This reminds me of the time I took a group of mostly Americantraders for a mock trading session on the floor of the Russian Exchangein Moscow. Each person was assigned an interpreter and given a paperbankroll. Everybody had a grand time, trading and taking pictures, exceptfor a lone Dutchman in our group. That market maker from Amsterdamkept furiously scribbling on the back of an envelope as he watchedprices on the display panel above the floor. When the session endedand we moved on to the executive dining room, they brought usTHE ORGANIZED TRADER 243\nprintouts with our results. It turned out that the group as a whole lost\na million rubles. The Dutchman made a little over 900,000 rubles, whilethe rest went up in slippage and commissions—a pretty commonoutcome. Good records help create good traders, which is why Iencourage you to invest time and energy in keeping and followingyour action plan.244 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nCHAPTER\nNINE\nTRADING FOR A LIVING\nTrading attracts us with its promise of freedom. If you can trade, you\ncan live and work anywhere in the world, be independent from\nthe routine, and not answer to anybody. You can trade from a beachbungalow or a mountaintop chalet, as long as you have a good Inter-net connection. You have no boss, no customers, no alarm clock. Youare your own person.\nPeople pay lip service to their dreams of freedom, but many feel\nfrightened by it. If I stop making money for any reason whatsoever, nocorporate parent will take care of me. This a frightening thought formost people. No wonder so many of us have grown used to the secu-rity of our corporate cages.\nCaged animals develop all sorts of neurotic behaviors. A common\nneurosis is an addiction to the earn-and-spend cycle. We are taughtsince childhood that our place in society is defined by what we con-sume. If you drive a $50,000 car, you are a better, more successful per-son than someone who drives a $15,000 auto, whereas a neighbor whodrives a $120,000 car is a very special winner altogether. The man whodresses at an Armani boutique is a more refined individual than some-one who buys his pants and shirts at the corner store. Society wavescountless carrots in our faces. The ads sell not food, shelter, or trans-portation, but a boost of self-esteem. An addict feels revived by a fixfor only a short time. People spend their entire lives straining to keepup with the Joneses. Those dastardly Joneses do not have the decencyto stay in place, and as they climb the ladder, we must climb also.\nFreedom begins in our minds, not in our bank accounts. To liberate\nyourself, start becoming conscious of your spending. You are likely to\n245\nsee that you need much less than you thought, making freedom that\nmuch closer.\nThere was a Wall Street analyst by the name of Joe Dominguez who\nsaved enough money to retire at 31. He spent the rest of his life enjoy-ing himself, doing volunteer work, and writing a book called Your\nMoney or Your Life.\nWe aren’t making a living, we are making a dying. Consider the\naverage American worker. The alarm rings at 6:45 and our workingman or woman is up and running. Shower. Dress in the professionaluniform—suits or dresses for some, overalls for others, whites for themedical professionals, jeans and flannel shirts for construction workers.Breakfast, if there’s time. Grab commuter mug and briefcase (or lunchbox) and hop in the car for the daily punishment called rush hour. Onthe job from nine to five. Deal with the boss. Deal with the coworkersent by the devil to rub you the wrong way. Deal with suppliers. Dealwith clients/customers/patients. Act busy. Hide mistakes. Smile whenhanded impossible deadlines. Give a sigh of relief when the ax knownas ‘restructuring’ or ‘downsizing’—or just plain getting laid off—falls onother heads. Shoulder the added workload. Watch the clock. Argue withyour conscience but agree with the boss. Smile again. Five o’clock.Back in the car and onto the freeway for the evening commute. Home.Act human with mates, kids or roommates. Eat. Watch TV. Bed. Eighthours of blessed oblivion.\nAnd they call this making a living? Think about it. How many\npeople have you seen who are more alive at the end of the work daythan they were at the beginning? . . . Aren’t we killing ourselves—ourhealth, our relationships, our sense of joy and wonder—for our jobs?We are sacrificing our lives for money—but it’s happening so slowlythat we barely notice.\nPull out your old tax returns or cash income books and add up all\nearnings since your first job. You’re likely to find that even a moder-ately successful person has earned a million dollars or more. And spentit! Have you ever seen hamsters racing on a treadmill? Wouldn’t it benice to hop off, go for a walk, stop by some flowers and inhale? Mostpeople cannot relax because they are hooked on spending. When theybegin to trade, they set impossible goals. Fifty percent in the first yearis not enough when you crave a downpayment on a Ferrari.\nThere is nothing wrong with owning a Ferrari or any other luxury,\nprovided you have given it a lot of thought and are buying it for a true246 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\npersonal need rather than responding to advertising propaganda.\nPeople keep buying things to shut out their feelings of emptiness anddissatisfaction. A person who uses money to stuff up his sense ofemptiness can hardly focus on finding the best quality trades.\nFind the minimal level of spending which feels comfortable to you.\nTo quote Dominguez again, \nYou have enough for your survival, enough for your comforts, \nand even some special luxuries, with no excess to burden you un-necessarily. Enough is a powerful and free place. A confident andflexible place.\nBecome conscious of your expenditures. Use cash instead of plastic\nwhenever possible. Stop trying to impress people with your posses-sions. They are not paying attention because they are too busy tryingto impress you. Pay off all your debts, including your mortgage. That’snot too hard once you reduce your expenses. Set aside enough moneyto live for 6 to 12 months and loosen the link between work andincome. Trading should be a high-paying, high-integrity self-employ-ment. Once your living expenses are covered, start putting extra prof-its into tax-free bonds so that eventually you’ll have enough income totake care of your normal needs in perpetuity. If tax-free municipalsyield 5%, then $1 million worth of them will bring you $50,000 a year,free and clear. Will that be enough? Will you need twice that much?Three times? Five? The sooner you lower your expenses, the sooneryou’ll reach the moment of liberation. Rationally managing your per-sonal finances prepares you to rationally manage your trading account.\nYou probably did not expect a discussion of personal spending in a\nbook on trading. If it has caught your attention, follow up by readingthe Dominguez book. The key idea for traders is to approach the mar-ket in a sober and rational manner, maximizing gains, minimizinglosses, and being accountable for every step that they take.\nDISCIPLINE AND HUMILITY\nA friend started out as a floor clerk and struggled for eight years beforehis trading took off. Now he is a world-famous money manager, andmany of those who knew him when he was a beginner like to remi-nisce about how he clerked on one of the smaller exchanges in NewYork, taught classes, and struggled to make ends meet. An old traderTRADING FOR A LIVING 247\nsaid to me, “I knew him then, and I thought he would succeed. He had\nthe right combination of being very careful and having this optimismyou need to get up in the morning and believe you’re going to makemoney trading the markets.”\nTo succeed in trading, you need both confidence and caution.\nHaving only one is dangerous. If you’re confident but not cautious,you’ll be arrogant, and that’s a deadly trait for traders. If, on the otherhand, you are cautious but have no confidence, you will not be ableto pull the trigger.\nYou need confidence to say, “This stock is going up, my indicators say\nit will continue to rise, I am going to get long and ride this trend.” At thesame time, you need to be humble enough to put on trades whose sizewill not endanger your account. You have to accept the uncertainty ofthe markets and be ready to take a small loss without quibbling.\nWhen you feel a surge of confidence in a new trade, it is hard to\nthink of the downside risk, but if you don’t do it, you cannot protectyourself. When the market goes against you and hits your predefinedexit level, you have to humbly exit, no matter how confident you feelabout that trade. You need both confidence and humility. The abilityto be aware of two conflicting feelings at the same time is one of thehallmarks of emotional maturity.\nI have a client in New York who came to several seminars and\nbought books and videos from my firm but kept struggling for years asa trader. He’d get ahead, fall behind, get ahead again, then lose moneyand get a job to make ends meet. He often seemed on the verge ofsuccess, but kept bouncing around breakeven. Then one day, I raninto him at a conference and saw a changed man. He was doingsupremely well, managing about $80 million, with terrific grades fromthe rating agencies. A few weeks later I stopped by his office.\nHe had continued using the same trading system, developed years\nago and derived from Triple Screen. He had made only one change.Instead of second-guessing the system, he came to see himself as aclerk. He imagined he had a boss who went to Tahiti and left him totrade the system. The boss will return and give him a bonus, depend-ing not on profits, but on how faithfully he followed the system. Myclient stopped trying to be a hot-shot trader and moved into a positionof humility and discipline. That’s when he rose to sweeping success.\nSecond-guessing a system is a terrible error that creates a huge level\nof uncertainty. Tom Basso, a prominent money manager, says that it is248 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nhard enough to figure out what the market is going to do; if you do\nnot know what you’re going to do, the game is lost.\nChoose your system, set up your money management rules, test\neverything. Run the system each night, write down its signals, and readthose messages to your broker in the morning. Do not improvise whenquotes flash in front of your face because they hypnotize you andprompt you to put on impulsive trades.\nWhat if the markets change and your system starts missing good\nmoves or chewing up equity? Well, you should have tested it over along enough stretch of data to feel confident about its long-term per-formance. Your money management rules will help you ride out a roughstretch. Be very conservative with an existing system. If you’re f eeling\nrestless, design a new system and trade it in a different account—leavewhat works alone.\nTrading demands discipline, but, paradoxically, attracts impulsive\npeople. Trading requires practice, humility, and perseverance. Success-ful traders are strong but humble people, open to new ideas. Beginnerslike to brag, experts like to listen.\nTen Points\nWhen a beginner puts on a trade too big for his account, and it startsto swing, it floods him with adrenaline. An upswing gives him enoughmoney to dream about moving to easy street. Feeling elated, he missesthe signals of a top and gets caught in a downside reversal. A down-swing puts him into such a state of fear that he misses the signals of abottom and sells out right near the lows. Beginners pay more attentionto their emotions than to the reality of the markets. \nOnce you begin to develop discipline, you start seeing much more\nclearly what happens outside of your little account and in the great bigmarket out there. When you see the market freeze in a flat tradingrange or explode in a vertical rally, you know what the masses oftraders feel, because you have been there. When a market goes flat,and amateurs lose interest, you know that a breakout is coming. Youwere once that amateur, you overlooked breakouts because you gotbored and stopped watching the markets. Now, when the market goesflat, you recognize the way you used to be, and are ready to act.\nThe market surges to a new high, pauses for a day, and goes verti-\ncal. The newspapers, radio, and TV are screaming about the new bullTRADING FOR A LIVING 249\nmarket. If you are a disciplined trader, you remember how, years ago,\nyou bought within a few ticks of the top. This time is different. Youreach for the phone and start taking profits on positions acquiredwhen the market looked boring and flat. Understanding yourself andthe path you have traveled allows you to read the market and beatyour competitors.\nHow do you know that you are becoming a disciplined trader?You keep accurate records. You maintain the minimum of four\nrecords—a trader’s spreadsheet, an equity curve, a trader’s diary, andan action plan. You scrupulously keep your records up to date andstudy them to learn from your experiences.\nYour equity curve shows a steady uptrend with shallow drawdowns.\nThe performance standard for professional money managers is 25%annual gain on the account, with no drawdowns of more than 10%from peak equity. If you can match or exceed that, you are far aheadof the game.\nYou make your own trading plans. Even when you get a terrific-\nsounding tip from a friend, you do not get swept up in the excitement.You either ignore it or put it through your own decision-making screens.\nYou do not chat about your trading. You may discuss a technical\npoint or a closed trade with a trusted friend, but you never ask for ad-vice on an open trade. You do not disclose your positions so as not toexpose yourself to unwanted advice or tie up your ego in the process.\nYou learn all you can about the market you’re trading. You have a\ngood grasp of the main technical, fundamental, intermarket, and polit-ical factors that may impact your stock or a future.\nYou grade yourself on the adherence to your written plan. Imagine\nyou are an employee, and the boss has left on an extended vacation,leaving you to manage his money by following his plan. When he re-turns he will reward or punish you based on how faithfully you fol-lowed his plan.\nYou allot a certain amount of time to the markets each day. You\ndownload data each day, put it through your battery of tests andscreens, and write down the results and plans for tomorrow. You allo-cate time in your daily schedule to make trading a regular activity andnot something you do catch as catch can.\nYou monitor selected markets daily, regardless of their activity. You\navoid the typical beginners’ error of monitoring markets only when250 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nthey are active and “interesting.” You know that strong moves spring\nfrom periods of relative inactivity.\nYou learn and are open to new ideas, but are skeptical of claims. You\nread market books and magazines, attend conferences, participate inonline forums, but you do not accept any ideas without testing them onyour own data.\nYou follow your money management rules as if your life depended\non them—because your financial life does. If you have good money\nmanagement, most decent trading systems will make you money in thelong run.\nHAVEYOUGOT THE TIME?\nAll traders pay attention to money but few are aware of the importanceof time. Time is just as crucial as money—the more you have, the morelikely you are to win.\nMost people start out with too little money, and most traders do not\ngive themselves enough time to learn. Trading is very different fromphysics or mathematics, where genius reveals itself early. In science, ifyou’re not a star by the time you’re 25, you’ll never be one. Trading,on the contrary, is an old man’s game, and now increasingly a woman’s.Patience is a virtue and memory a great asset. If you slightly improve\neachyear, you can grow into a brilliant trader.\nMy friend Lou Taylor, to whom Trading for a Living was dedicated,\nused to say, “if I become half a percent smarter each year, I’ll be agenius by the time I die.” As always with him, there was a great deal ofwisdom in his joke.\nRaise your eyes from the keyboard and think about two goals—to\nlearn to trade and to make money. Which comes first and which comessecond? Stop killing yourself trying to make a lot of money in a hurry.Learn to trade, and the money will follow. An intelligent horse trainerdoes not overload a young horse. Training comes first, pulling heavyloads comes later.\nYou learn best by making many small trades and analyzing your per-\nformance. The more you trade, the more you learn. Play for small stakesto reduce the pressure and concentrate on quality. You can always in-crease your size later. The goal is to acquire enough experience so thatmost actions become nearly automatic. A trader whose experience hasTRADING FOR A LIVING 251\ntaught him a lot of practical skills can focus on strategy—what he\nwants to do—instead of worrying about his next step.\nIf you are serious about trading, you have got to put time into it.\nMarkets have to be studied, trading methods dissected and rated, sys-tems designed and applied, decisions made and recorded. All of thisadds up to a fair bit of work. What is a fair bit? Two examples cometo mind, at opposite ends of the spectrum.\nAt the hard-working end, I think of a top-rated American futures\nmoney manager in whose apartment I once stayed. We lived under thesame roof, but I hardly ever saw him. He would leave for the officebefore 7 \nA.M., return after 10 P.M., and fall asleep in his clothes in the\nliving room. He worked like that six days a week, but on a Sunday hetook it easy. In the morning he would go for a game of squash at aclub before running back to the office to prepare for the opening onMonday. No wife, no girlfriend, no pastimes, and no friends—but man,was he raking in millions!\nAt the relaxed, but still very disciplined end, I think of a middle-\naged Chinese trader whom I visited in his mansion when the stockmarkets were reeling throughout Asia. He had made a fortune in thetwo bull markets of the previous 10 years and told me that he neededjust one more Asian bull market to make all the money he wanted. Hewas prepared to wait for several years for the next one, but mean-while looked after his family, collected art, and played a lot of golf.He spent a few hours a week downloading the data and watching hisindicators.\nHow much time should you spend analyzing markets and doing\nyour homework? A beginner must spend every minute of his wakinghours learning the basics. How much time will you need at the nextstage, once you’ve become a competent semiprofessional trader? Weare talking about position trading and not day-trading, which forcesone to stay in front of the screen all day. The answer depends on howfast you work and how many markets you trade.\nYou must dedicate a certain amount of time to the markets each day.\nAmateurs and gamblers make a typical mistake. When markets areinactive, they stop watching and lose touch. They wake up after hear-ing the news of a runaway move. By that time, the markets are run-ning—the amateurs have missed yet another train and now they chaseit, hoping to hop aboard a runaway trend.252 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nAn organized trader tracks his markets, whether he trades them at\nthe moment or not. He notices when a listless range starts rubbingagainst a resistance, buys early, and when amateurs start piling into therally, he takes profits, selling to lazy latecomers. A serious trader isahead of the game because he does his homework day in and day out.\nHow much time will you need? For every stock you must get a handle\non its key fundamentals, including its industry group. For futures, thereare the additional factors of supply and demand, seasonals, and spreadsbetween delivery months. You need to make a calendar of events thatmay impact your market, such as Federal Reserve announcements orearnings reports. You need to study weekly charts for the past severalyears and daily charts for at least a year. You need to apply indicators,learn which work best with that market, and test their parameters.\nUnless you are a genius or a speed demon, it is hard to accomplish\nthis in less than two hours. And that is just an entry fee into any trad-ing vehicle. Afterward the daily grind begins. A serious trader reviewsweekly and daily charts each day. You have to compare your marketwith other related ones. You have to make daily notes and write downyour plans for the day ahead. To do this properly, you’ll need at least15 minutes per stock or future.\nAnd this is in a fairly routine day. What about the day when your\nmarket hits support or resistance, or breaks out of its trading range, anda trade seems imminent? Then you might spend closer to an hour ana-lyzing it, measuring risk and reward, and deciding on your entry pointsand profit targets.\nSo let us turn the question around: If you have an hour a day for\nanalysis, how many markets should you follow? Three, maybe four. Ifyou have two hours, you may be able to follow six, eight, or even ten.The ABC system for organizing homework may allow you to doublethe number of markets. Whatever you do, remember, quality is moreimportant than quantity.\nBefore you add a stock to your list, decide whether you have enough\ntime to track it, day in and day out. You may skip a day once in a while,but even then you should at least glance at your markets. Daily home-work is essential, and the number of markets you may follow dependson how much time you have each day. When we get out of touch, wegrow cold. Even professionals take a few days to get back in touch withtheir markets after a vacation. These are the stages of development:TRADING FOR A LIVING 253\nBeginner: At the start, track approximately six, but no more than 10\ntrading vehicles. You can always add more later. It is better to start withfewer markets and follow them well than to start with a lot and fallbehind.\nDaily homework is essential for developing a feel for the markets.\nAllocate time to study your markets each day. Even if you come homelate at night from your job or a party, you can still find 10 minutes todownload the data and glance at your five or six stocks. You canupdate your mental picture of them even if you don’t plan to tradethem tomorrow. A beginner who follows too many stocks bites offmore than he can chew, falls behind, and becomes demoralized. Betterto follow a small number, get to know them well, and add more later.\nIntermediate: You may track several dozen stocks or futures at this\nstage. Analyzing each will take just as much time as it did when youwere a beginner, but you’ll analyze them more deeply. A serious ama-teur or a semiprofessional trader can use his time more efficiently withthe help of the ABC Rating System (see next page).\nSome good traders choose not to expand the number of stocks or\nfutures they trade. A person might concentrate only on soybeans andtheir products, or only currencies, or only five or six technology stocks.In addition to analyzing your markets, expect to spend a minimum offive to six hours a week reading books and articles and interacting withother traders on the Internet.\nAfter about a year or longer at this stage you will face an important\nchoice: to treat trading as a mildly profitable hobby or to try to rise tothe professional level. In that case, you will need to dedicate more timeto trading. You will have to make sacrifices in other areas of your lifeand spend at least four to six hours a day working in the markets.\nProfessional: people who trade for a living tend to drop other profes-\nsional interests. The markets demand time and attention, and moneymanagement is more challenging because the account is much bigger.\nA professional trader almost always uses some version of the ABC\nRating System, unless he chooses to trade just a handful of markets.He spends more time researching the markets. At the same time, hereviews them faster, thanks to his greater level of expertise. He spendsseveral hours each week reading, deepening his analysis and improv-ing his money management, and also keeping track of new develop-ments on the Internet.254 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nThe rewards are very good at this stage, but a professional who has\nput years into getting there does not become intoxicated with theresults. He lives very well, but continues to work harder than mostbeginners. Traders at this level love the markets and derive a great dealof satisfaction from them, like skiers enjoy tall mountains.\nManaging Time with the ABC Rating System\nMarkets generate colossal volumes of information. No human canprocess all the available data. No one can have in mind all the funda-mental values, the economic trends, the technical indicators, the intra-day action, and the buying and selling by insiders and market makerswhile making a trading decision. We want to be thorough in ourresearch, but it can never be complete. We need to select a relativelysmall number of markets and design a trading plan in order to chan-nel the incoming information into a more manageable stream.\nTrading is not about being brilliant, not about making forecasts, and\nnot about scanning a huge universe of trading vehicles. Trading isabout managing—our capital, our time, our analysis, and ourselves. Ifwe manage right, we’ll grind out profits.\nManaging time is an important aspect of success. Find out how\nmuch time you need, depending on your personal style, to research anew market and track it daily. The ABC Rating System is designed todeliver major time savings, allowing you to track and trade more mar-kets in the same time. This system is not for beginners, but an inter-mediate or expert trader can definitely benefit from it.\nThe ABC Rating System, shown to me by D. Guppy, is a system for\nmanaging time. It helps us concentrate on the markets in which a tradeseems imminent and spend less time in less promising markets. TheABC system calls for a quick weekly review of all stocks or futures thatyou track and sorting them into three groups: A for those you think youmight trade tomorrow, B for those you think you may trade later in theweek, and C for those you do not expect to trade in the coming week.\nThe best time to run the ABC system is on weekends, after you have\ndownloaded all your data. Prepare a spreadsheet with a horizontal linefor every stock or future you follow. Put their names in the left column.Use vertical columns to record your A, B, and C ratings, one columnper day. Prepare the weekly and daily templates in your trading soft-ware. Drop the first market into the weekly template. Does it look likeTRADING FOR A LIVING 255\nyou might want to trade this stock tomorrow? For instance, if you only\ntrade from the long side and the weekly chart is in a solid downtrend,you will not trade it next week. In that case, mark it with a C and moveon. Drop the next market into your weekly template. If it looks like apossible trade, then drop it into your daily template. Does it look likeyou might want to trade it on Monday? If so, put an A into your spread-sheet. If it looks like an unlikely trade on Monday but possibly laterthat week, put a B in your spreadsheet. Now move to the next marketand drop it into the weekly template. Repeat this process until you gothrough your entire list.\nKeep a good pace, do not slow down. You should be done with\neach market in well under one minute. Remember, good trades shouldleap at you from the screen and grab you by the face—it’s me, trademe! If you have to squint at a chart, there’s probably no trade.\nThe real work begins after you have filled in your ABC spreadsheet.\nNow you must study each stock or future you have marked with an A.Apply your trading system, set up entry levels, stops, and profit targets,and write down your orders for the day ahead. Do this for every mar-ket you have rated an A, leaving aside all others. After the closing onMonday, go through all your A-rated markets. If you have enteredthem, fill in a page in your trading diary and continue to manage thosetrades according to your plan. If your entry orders have not been trig-gered, review those markets again—do you still want to enter onTuesday? Filtering out B and C groups saves time and lets you con-centrate on the most promising trades.\nRepeat the procedure after the closing on Tuesday, but now also\nreview the markets you rated B over the weekend. Now is the time todecide whether you can upgrade them to an A and start monitoringthem daily or downgrade them to a C and leave them alone until theweekend.\nEarlier, we reviewed the action plan, a spreadsheet for recording your\norders for the day ahead. That and the ABC system lend themselves tobeing combined into a single spreadsheet. Each horizontal line holdsa trading vehicle, and each vertical column one trading day. The cellsare filled with the letters A, B, or C, indicating your rating for that stock orfuture for the day ahead. Red triangles in the corners identify those cellsin which you have inserted comments that tell you how to trade them.\nBoredom is the trader’s enemy. It is hard to watch a market day after\nday while it goes nowhere. A professional must track his markets, but256 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nno one enjoys watching paint dry. The ABC system provides an ele-\ngant solution. It lets you monitor all your markets in a quick and effi-cient manner, while dedicating most of your time and attention to themost promising trades. Once you get used to applying the ABC system,you can easily double the number of markets you follow and increaseyour trading opportunities.\nTHEDECISION -MAKING TREE\nA professional trader takes the markets seriously and gives them thetime and attention they deserve. If you have read this far, you are prob-ably more dedicated than the average person. Now is the time to zeroin on your plan of action.\nYou need to allocate a certain time to market work each day; keep-\ning in close touch with the market is essential for success. You have todecide what markets to trade and focus on a select few to be success-ful. You need to design a plan for your education. Last but not least,you need to design your trading plan; a written plan is the hallmark ofa serious trader.\nDesigning a Trading Plan\nTraders go through three stages of development. We all start out asbeginners. Some of us survive long enough to become serious ama-teurs or semipros, and a few rise to the expert level. A trader with agood written plan shows a rising level of development.\nA beginner never writes down a plan because he has nothing to\nwrite. He is having too much fun chasing hot tips and trying to makea quick killing. Even if he wanted to write, he wouldn’t know where tobegin. A serious amateur or a semipro who writes down a plan, includ-ing money management rules, is on his way toward the expert level.\nThe main difference between a trading plan and a mechanical sys-\ntem is the degree of freedom it allows traders. Trading systems arerigid, whereas plans lay down the main rules but leave you free to useyour judgment.\nSome beginners gain a false sense of security from pouring tons of data\ninto mechanical systems and finding sets of rules that would have workedin the past. The markets are live social organisms that develop, grow, andchange. Rigid rules fitted to past data are not likely to perform well in theTRADING FOR A LIVING 257\nfuture. If mechanical systems could work, the best programmers would\nhave owned the markets by now. All mechanical trading systems, leftalone, self-destruct with the passage of time. Promoters keep selling thembecause the public loves marketing gimmicks.\nA trading plan includes a few unbreakable rules along with more\nflexible recommendations that call for an exercise of judgment. Yourjudgment grows with experience. A trading plan includes the princi-ples for selecting markets, defines the types of trades, generates buyand sell signals, and allocates trading capital. When you write a plan,avoid the temptation to make it all-encompassing. Know when to stop.Write down your rules but indicate where you will use your judgmentat the moment of decision.\nYou must know what type of trading appeals to you. A general\nidea—to make money buying and selling—is not specific enough.Winners make money in different ways, while all losers fall into thesame wastebasket of impulsivity. A long-term fundamental investor,like Peter Lynch, searching for his elusive “10-bagger”—a stock thatrises 10-fold—acts differently from a successful short-term trader whogoes short to sell him that stock. Both may succeed in the long run,but the floor trader with a 30-minute time horizon will close his shortson a tiny but profitable dip before the end of the day, just as surely asthe long-term investor will hold on to his longs.\nA trading plan reflects your interests in specific markets and tech-\nniques, your experience, and the size of your account. It reflectsyour personality as well as the behavior of your markets. If twofriends with equal capital and similar experience traded the samemarket and wrote down their plans, they would come up with differ-ent outlines. You may create more than one plan if you like differenttypes of trading.\nIf you do not have a plan, start working on one. Drafting an intelli-\ngent plan requires a huge amount of work. The first time I tried to doit was on a flight from New York to Los Angeles. I thought that fivehours in the air would be enough. A month later I was still at it.\nHere are two fairly basic outlines of trading plans to illustrate their\nbasic structure and provide starting points for developing your own.Reading someone’s trading plan is like reading a guide to lovemaking.That manual may open your eyes to a few new positions, but ulti-mately you’ll have to do what suits your temperament and environ-ment to enjoy the results.258 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nTrading Plan A Trader A has $50,000 in his account and is inter-\nested in the stock mar ket. He has been tracking it for a while and has\nobserved that large-capitalization stocks (Dow-type stocks) tend tomove in steady trends but swing above and below their central ten-dencies several times a year.\nA trading plan takes a concept of market behavior—that prices oscil-\nlate above and below their average value—and translates it into a planof action. It identifies the trend and the deviations, selects the tools forcatching them, and includes money management rules, profit targets,and stops.\nRESEARCH\n1.Download four years’ worth of data for 30 stocks in the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average.\n2.Use weekly charts with a 26-week EMA to identify their long-term\ntrends.\nA serious trader will test other approaches such as a longer or a\nshorter EMA, different EMAs for different stocks, or another trend-\nfollowing tool, such as a least regression trendline. Finding the besttools for tracking the average consensus of value in your marketforces you to do a lot of research before putting on the first trade.\n3.Determine the average deviation from value for each stock you plan\nto trade.\nMeasure how high a stock rises above or falls below its weekly\nEMA before swinging back. Channels can help, or you can put thenumbers into a spreadsheet. Find out how far from the EMA thereversals occur, both in terms of price and percentages, as well asthe average duration of those deviations.\nWEEKLY ACTIONS\nReview the weekly charts of all stocks you follow. Mark those that havedeviated from their central tendencies by more than 75% of their aver-age deviation and place them on your daily monitoring list.\nDAILYACTIONS\nTo streamline our discussion, we will consider only buying even thougha complete trading plan is also likely to spell out steps for shorting.TRADING FOR A LIVING 259\n1.Apply a 22-day EMA to stocks on your daily monitoring list to define\ntheir short-term trends. Research whether a longer or a shorter EMAwould do a better job. When a stock is deviating on the weekly chartbut its daily EMA stops moving and turns flat, it becomes a buycandidate.\nHere is another research idea: Is buying more profitable when the\nbroad market rises? How will you define the trend of the broad mar-ket? The EMA of an index, such as the S&P or NASDAQ, or an indi-cator, such as a new-high–new-low Index*? If your stocks march totheir own drummer, then ignore the broad market; otherwise, you\nmay buy more when the broad market rises and less when it falls.\n2.When the weekly chart shows a downside deviation, buy the first\nuptick of the daily EMA. Research types of entries—below the EMA,in its vicinity, at the market, or on a breakout above the previousday’s high.\n3.Place a stop using the SafeZone indicator on the daily chart and set\na profit target at the weekly EMA. Recalculate your orders daily.\nCalculate your dollar risk per share and decide how many shares to\nbuy while observing the 2% Rule. A trader with $50,000 in his accountmay not risk more than $1,000 per trade, including slippage and com-missions. Do not enter a trade if 6% of your account is already exposedto risk in other trades.\nThis plan includes several inviolate rules: buy only when prices are\nbelow the weekly EMA; buy only when the daily EMA is rising; do yourhomework, recalculate your stops daily, and never risk more than 2%of your account equity; do not expose more than 6% of your accountto risk. This plan also makes you exercise your judgment about exactlywhere to enter, where to set profit targets, and what size to trade (as260 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\n*This simple indicator, which can easily be calculated for any exchange, is the best\ngauge of the power of bulls and bears in the stock market. New highs are the stocksthat are making a new high for the year—the leaders in strength. New lows are the\nstocks that are making a new low for the year—the leaders in weakness. If you com-pare their number each day, you will see whether the upside or the downside leader-\nship is stronger. This indicator shows you what the leaders are doing, and you canusually expect the crowds to follow the leaders. I have described this indicator atlength in Trading for a Living .\nlong as you follow the 2% and the 6% Rules). It goes without saying\nthat you have to back up your written plan by keeping good records.\nYour plan is likely to grow more elaborate with the passage of time.\nThe market will throw several curves at you, which will lead you toadjust your plan and make it longer. The plan above ties Triple Screenanalysis (multiple timeframes and indicators) with money management,entries, and exits.\nTrading Plan B Trader B has $30,000 of risk capital and wants to\ntrade futures. He has noticed that those markets tend to spend a lot oftime in flat trading ranges, punctuated by relatively brief but fast trends.He wants to take advantage of those short-term impulse moves.\nR\nESEARCH\nThis trader has relatively little money, but doesn’t want to trade mini-\ncontracts. Therefore, he should focus on inexpensive markets whosenormal levels of noise will not overwhelm his money managementrules.\nFor example, a 1-point change in the S&P 500 translates into $250\nin the S&P futures. A normal 5-point move on an ordinary day willlead to a $1,250 change in equity, exposing a trader with a $30,000account to a 4% loss. The 2% Rule puts many volatile and expensivemarkets off limits for small accounts. Coffee, soybeans, currencies,and many others have to be left alone until your account grows muchlarger.\n1.Download two years’ history in corn, sugar, and copper. Corn is\nthe least volatile of grains, and sugar is the least volatile tropical. Bothare very liquid, permitting easy entries and exits, unlike other inex-pensive markets, such as orange juice, whose thin volume exposestraders to bad slippage. Copper is liquid and tends to be relativelyquiet, except during economic booms. E-minis, electronically tradedindex futures, are good for futures traders interested in the stockmarket. Download two data series for each contract: at least twoyears of continuous data for weekly charts and six months of thefront month data for daily charts.\n2.Test several EMAs to determine which does the best job of tracking\ntrends on the weekly charts. Do a similar job with the daily charts.Find the best channels for each market, especially for the past threeTRADING FOR A LIVING 261\nmonths on the daily charts. Those channels must contain 90 to 95\npercent of recent market action. The past three months are the mostrelevant, but it is a good idea to go back two years in your channelresearch to prepare yourself for their dramatic expansions and con-tractions. Many traders lose their bearings when markets change. Ifyou know your history, you’ll feel less surprised.\nW\nEEKLY ACTIONS\nReview the weekly charts of your markets and determine their trends.\nWhen the weekly trend is up, proceed to the daily charts and look forbuying opportunities. When the weekly is down, look for shortingopportunities. If the weekly trend is unclear, either leave that marketalone or go directly to the daily charts.\nYou can define weekly trends by using the slope of an EMA, or you\ncan be more inventive, especially if you track just a few markets. Forexample, you can use both the EMA and the MACD-Histogram to iden-tify trends. When both indicators move in the same direction, they sig-nal extra strong moves.\nD\nAILYACTIONS\nAgain, to streamline our discussion, we will only discuss buying, but\nthe same logic applies to shorting. Every futures trader must be com-fortable with shorting. These markets have no uptick rule, and the num-ber of short positions always equals that of longs.\n1.Apply the Impulse System. When both the EMA and MACD-Histogram\nrise, they give a strong buy signal.\n2.Go long the following day, but do not buy above the upper chan-\nnel line.\nThis aggressive entry aims to capture high-speed impulse moves.\nYou will have to research and test this idea in the market you wantto trade at the moment. Avoid the trap of mechanical systems thatpeople trade long after the markets have changed.\nBefore you enter a trade, calculate where to put your stop. See\nwhat percentage of capital you will risk in that trade. Decidewhether your money management rules allow you to take it. Doesthe 6% Rule allow you to trade? For example, if you’ve lost 3.5%of your account this month and have an open trade with 2% of262 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nequity at risk, no new trade may be opened because it would risk\nmore than 6% of your equity.\n3.Set a stop using the SafeZone indicator on the daily chart. \nIf your stop placement allows you to take the trade, place the buy\norder. As soon as you have your confirmation, place your stop. Recal-culate your stop and place a new one each day. Don’t allow a sud-den violent move to blow through a mental stop while you’re notwatching.\nTake your profit before the close of the day during which the\ndaily screen goes off its buy signal. This means you have to calcu-late your formula a few minutes before the close. The upper chan-nel line on the daily chart is too modest a target when you arefishing for an impulse move. Stay with the trade as long as the buysignal stays in force. Be sure to test this approach.\nThis plan combines inviolate rules with recommendations that\nencourage you to use your judgment. Using multiple timeframes, fol-lowing money management rules, using stops, and scrupulously keep-ing records are non-negotiable. Choosing the markets, the entry points,and the profit targets and deciding what size to trade—these all dependon your judgment.\nExpect to modify your plan as you continue to research the markets\nand as your expertise grows. Remember to write down any changes,and record your development as a trader. Be sure to add short sellingto your plan because this is an integral part of trading futures.\nAt some point you may want to design a flowchart of your decision-\nmaking process, along these lines:\nDoes the 6% Rule allow me to trade? \nIf No, stand aside; if Yes:\nIs the weekly chart giving a signal?\nIf No, move to the next market; if Yes:\nIs the daily chart giving me a signal to trade in the same direction?\nIf No, skip that market; if Yes:\nWhere will I put my profit target and stop; is the risk-reward ratio\nworth trading?\nIf No, skip that trade, if Yes:TRADING FOR A LIVING 263\nWhat size does the 2% Rule allow me to trade and how much will \nI trade?\nOne could draw an extensive flowchart for every trade, but the key\npoint is to observe several inviolate rules, mostly having to do withmoney management and multiple timeframes. As long as you observethose rules, you have a wide choice of analytic and trading techniques.Just be sure to keep good records and continue to learn from yourexperience if you want to trade like a pro.\nBEGINNER , SEMIPRO , PRO\nTraders’ questions reveal their stages of development. Beginners alwaysask about trading methods—what indicators to use, what systems tochoose. They want to know the right Stochastic parameters and thebest length of a moving average. Most newbies are so excited aboutprofits and so clueless about risk that no fancy tools can save themfrom disasters.\nThose who survive the stage of original innocence move on, thanks\nto a combination of luck, work, or an inborn sense of caution. Theylearn to select trades and find where to buy and sell. They start askingwhy their profits are so inconsistent, if they know so much. How cometheir account is up 20% one month and down 25% the next? How comethey can make money but not grow equity?\nTraders at the second stage often grab a profit and spend it before\nthat money evaporates. They feel insecure about their ability tomake money. I remember ages ago taking a penny profit from Swissfranc futures and rushing to a jewelry store to buy my then-wife anecklace. Another time, I used a little less than a cent profit to buymy daughter an expensive Abyssinian cat. Those cats have longlives and hers, named Swissie, used to remind me of my old impul-\nsive trading days.\nTraders who get stuck at that level keep bouncing up and down like\na flower in an ice hole. To move to the next stage, a trader must over-come the biggest obstacle to winning—the person he sees in the mirror.He must recognize his role in putting on impulsive trades, undisci-plined trades, trades without stops. No matter how clever his methods,he is not a winner until his mind is in the right place. His personality,with all its quirks, influences results more than any computer. Tradersat that stage ask: “Do I have to put in stops or can I use mental stops?”264 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\n“Why am I afraid to pull the trigger?” “How come the trades I don’t take\nwork out better than those I take?”\nA trader who survives, succeeds, and moves up to the third stage\nfeels relaxed and calm. When he asks questions, he is interested inmoney management. His trading system is in place, his discipline isgood, and he puts a lot of time into thinking how to allocate his trad-ing capital and reduce risk.\nThese three stages form a pyramid, a structure with a broad base\nand a narrow top. The journey has a high attrition rate. I wrote this\nbook to help make your passage a little smoother, faster, less painful,and more profitable.\nWhat are the reasonable profit targets for different stages? The\nnumbers I’ll give you may surprise you as low. You want to makemore money, and you should feel free to reach higher and do betterif you can. These guideposts should help you see whether you’remeeting the minimum requirements. They help you recognize whenyou are in trouble so that you can stop, think, and adjust yourmethods. If you trade for a bank and keep missing profit targets,your manager will pull your trading privileges. A private trader hasno manager and is in charge of his own discipline. If this bookhelps you stop, think, regroup, and move higher, I have not wasted\nmy time writing.\n1. B\nEGINNER\nA.The minimal acceptable performance level for a beginner is a\nloss of 10% of trading capital in a year. Traders are shocked\nwhen I give them this number. They forget that most begin-ners blow themselves out fast. Many lose 10% in a month ifnot in a week. If you can survive for a year, learn about trad-ing, and lose less than 10%, your education is cheap and youare way ahead of the crowd.\nB.The goal of a beginner is to cover trading expenses and gener-\nate annual return on his account equal to one and a halftimes the current rate on T-Bills or a comparable risklessinstrument. You have to charge the cost of software, data,\nclasses, and books, including the one you’re reading, againstyour trading account. Beginners often throw money at guruswho promise the keys to the kingdom. Charging your trading-related expenses against your account introduces a usefulTRADING FOR A LIVING 265\nreality check. If you can cover them and then beat the Treasury\nbills, you’ re no longer a beginner!\n2. I NTERMEDIATE (SERIOUS AMATEUR OR SEMIPROFESSIONAL )\nA.The minimum acceptable performance level for a serious\namateur is return on equity twice the current rate on T-Bills.Your improvement is evolutionary, not revolutionary. Cut someof your losses a little faster, grab some of your profits a littlesooner, learn a few more tricks of the trade. Once you’re cov-ering your trading expenses and making double what youcould get from riskless paper, you’re miles ahead of the effi-cient market theorists.\nB.The goal of a serious amateur or a semiprofessional is to gen-\nerate a 20% annual return on equity. At this stage, the size of\nyour trading capital becomes an important factor. If you aretrading a million dollars, you may be able to start living offyour profits. But what if you trade a relatively small account,say $50,000? You know you can trade, but 20% of $50,000 isnot enough for a living. Most undercapitalized traders destroythemselves by overtrading, trying to squeeze unrealistic returnsfrom their tiny accounts. Take crazy risks, and you’ll have crazyresults—both on the way up and on the way down. Better stickto your trading system and leverage your skills by trading otherpeople’s money (see “Going Pro” on the next page).\n3. E\nXPERT\nA.The minimal performance targets are more flexible for ex-\nperts. Their returns are steadier, but not necessarily higher thanthose of serious amateurs. You have to continue outperform-ing T-Bills—to fall behind them would be ridiculous. An expert\nmay grab a 100% return in a good year, but trading a serious\namount of money year after year, just staying north of 20% isa very good performance. Certified geniuses such as George\nSoros maintain a lifetime average of nearly 30% per year.\nB.The goal of an expert trader is to put enough money into riskless\ninvestments to be able to maintain his current standard of livingforever, even if he stops trading. Trading at this stage becomes a\ngame that you continue to play for your own enjoyment. Soroscertainly doesn’t need any more money for personal expenses266 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nbut trades because he enjoys spending fortunes on political and\ncharitable causes. Curiously enough, when you no longer haveto stretch for the money, it starts flowing in faster than ever.\nGOING PRO\nA beginner is better off starting with a relatively small account. Some-one who has moved up to a solid semiprofessional level needs to startpushing up his account size to increase profits. An expert with a largeaccount has to be cautious not to impact thin markets with his trades.He has to watch out for a fall in performance, a frequent side effect ofgreater size.\nThe minimum size for a trading account is about $20,000 at this\ntime. Once you’ve moved up to the level of a serious amateur or asemiprofessional trader, $80,000 will give you more freedom todiversify. Once you get your account up to $250,000, you may startthinking of moving up to professional trading. These are absoluteminimums, and if you can increase them, your life will be easier.Starting with $50,000, having $120,000 at a semiprofessional level, andmoving up to professional trading at $500,000 will improve yourchances of success.\nWhat if you do not have that much? Trading on a shoestring raises the\npressure to a deadly level. A person with a tiny account cannot applythe essential 2% Rule. If he has only $5,000, his permitted risk is only$100 per trade, which guarantees that he will be stopped out by marketnoise. A desperate beginner swallows hard and puts on a trade withouta stop. Most likely, he’ll lose, but what if he wins, ends up with $7,000,then puts on another trade and goes up to $10,000? If he is smart, he willsharply reduce his trading size and start using the 2% Rule now. He wasvery lucky and should put his winnings into a sensible trading program.Most people become intoxicated by success and cannot stop. A begin-ner who has doubled his $5,000 stake usually feels that the game is easyand he’s a genius. He feels he can walk on water, but soon drowns.\nYou might be able to start by getting a trading job, but corporate\nWall Street will not hire someone over 25 for a paying job as a tradertrainee. A more realistic option is to sharply cut expenses, get a moon-lighting job, and save money as fast as you can, while paper tradingthe markets. This calls for discipline, and some of the best traders have\nstarted this way. The third option is to trade other people’s money.TRADING FOR A LIVING 267\nTrading your own capital reduces the level of stress. Having to\nraise money increases tension and interferes with trading. Taking aloan is not a sensible way to raise funds because the interest raises aninsurmountable barrier to success. Borrowing money from family andfriends has the added kicker of having to justify their trust and trying toshow off.\nScared money is losing money. If you have to worry about paying it\nback, you cannot concentrate on trading. Companies that hire execu-tives usually run credit checks on their candidates. A high level of debtkills a candidacy because a person who is worried about money can-not properly concentrate on his job. I know a chronic loser whoreceived a quarter million from his mom as a wedding gift. She toldhim to buy an exchange seat as an investment, but he resented hisfinancial dependency on the strong-willed lady and decided to showhow good he really was. He took a loan against the seat and went totrade on the floor. His scheme had a predictable ending, and to thisday his family talks of “the missing seat.”\nYou are better off learning to trade with your own money. The time\nto use other people’s money comes when you know what you aredoing and want to leverage your skills. There are huge pools of capi-tal sloshing through the financial system, looking for competent moneymanagers. Show a good track record going back several years, and youwill have all the money you care to manage.\nI have a friend who earned an engineering degree but went to work\nas a floor clerk on a futures exchange. He spent several years learningto trade, saved $50,000, and then quit his job to trade full-time. Hemoonlighted by writing a book and teaching a few classes but contin-ued to struggle despite his steady 50% annual returns. His profit wasabout $25,000 a year, but he had to pay rent, eat, and occasionally buya new tennis racket and a pair of shoes. After a few years of this hehad a bad year and broke even. That’s when he had to eat his seedgrain—dip into his trading capital for living expenses. Then he con-nected with a big money management firm.\nThe firm checked his track record and staked him out with an addi-\ntional $50,000. He was to trade through that firm, at low commissions,and keep 20% of any profits on managed money. He kept delivering,and they kept giving him more money to manage. In a few years hewas up to $11 million but then had another bad year, returning only18% profit. In the old days he would be dipping into his capital, but268 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nnow the math was different. Eighteen percent profit on $11 million\ncame to almost $2 million, and his 20% share was $400,000. That’s howmuch he earned in a bad year. He now has over $100 million undermanagement. His performance as a trader has not changed much, butthe size of his rewards went through the roof.\nYou can start trading other people’s money informally, without a\nlicense, although you will have to register once the funds under man-agement exceed a certain limit. The rules are different for stocks andfutures because they have different regulators.\nYou can begin by asking people to give you the power of attorney\nover their accounts, allowing you to trade but not to withdraw themoney. Once you become registered, it is not a good idea to haveindividual managed accounts because their owners receive confirma-tion slips for each trade and pepper you with questions. It is better tohave all your accounts in a pool whose members receive a single state-ment at the end of the month telling them how much that pool is worthand what their share is.\nFutures money managers are regulated by the National Futures\nAssociation (NFA). To become a Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA),you must pass an exam known as Series 3, unless you are a floortrader. Stock market money managers are regulated by the Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC). Their exam, called Series 7, is muchharder and many people take months to prepare for it.\nThe more free-market NFA allows its members to charge perform-\nance fees, taking a share of profits, much as US lawyers work on con-tingency fees. It is not uncommon for a manager to take 20% of profits,but that is not how most of them make their money. Many charge 1%or 2% of assets as a management fee. If you collect 1% on $50 million,you are taking in half a million dollars a year just for being a nice guy.Any performance fees come on top of that as pure gravy.\nThe more blue-blood SEC does not allow performance fees, forcing\nits registrants to be satisfied with a small percentage of assets. Since theassets in the stock market are much greater than in the futures market,those fees are nothing to sneeze at. For all the mutual fund advertisinghoopla, those fees are a key deciding factor in funds’ long-term perfor-mance. The Vanguard Fund, which has always made low fees its key sell-ing point, keeps outperforming most hot-shot managers in the long run.\nStock market money managers have found a way to run around the\nSEC regulation against performance fees. They set up vehicles knownTRADING FOR A LIVING 269\nas hedge funds. Only so-called qualified investors who pass income\nand assets tests are allowed to invest in them. Hedge fund managerstypically put their own money into the funds and receive performancefees comparable to those in futures markets. A hedge fund manager istrading his own money along with that of his clients, which is proba-bly why hedge funds as a group outperform mutual funds. Trackinghedge fund managers and shifting funds between them offers an alter-native to tracking the markets for wealthy investors. If you go thisroute, make sure you find out what percentage of their own assets theyhave in their funds.\nSuccessful money managers go through three stages of develop-\nment. Many begin by informally managing a few modest accounts.Then they become registered and the funds under management rise tomillions of dollars. Those who accumulate a five-year track record ofsteady gains and low drawdowns can go after the key prize—pensionfunds and endowment money. Those who get to manage these assetsare the true elite of professional money managers.270 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nCHAPTER TEN\nCOME INTO \nMY TRADING ROOM\nGood trades begin and end with money management. The 6% Rule\ntells you whether you may put on a trade in the first place. Then,\nbefore you place an order, the 2% Rule tells you the maximum sizeallowed for that trade, based on the distance from your entry to the stop.Sandwiched between those rules is market analysis. Here, in this chapter,I want to illustrate the analytic process for you.\nShocking but true, most people who write books on trading do not\ntrade. In putting together their books, they rely on the power of well-chosen hypothetical examples. The only people obligated to disclose theirtrack records are money managers. I trade my own money and feel noneed to lay my full accounting open to curiosity seekers. Still, you trustedme enough to buy this book. Since all trust is mutual, I want to recipro-cate by showing you some of my trades.\nHere are a few trades I executed in recent months. It is important that\nall of them have already been closed out. One of the worst things a tradercan do is reveal his open trades, putting his ego on the line and gummingup the decision-making process. Completed trades are history, from whichwe may learn.\nThese charts show how one trader makes his buy and sell decisions. Mine\nare based primarily on Triple Screen trading system—making strategic deci-sions in the longer timeframe and tactical decisions in the shorter timeframe.\nWhenever I put on a trade, I print out its charts and mark key signals\nthat prompted me to act. Whenever I close a trade, I print out its chartsagain and mark up those signals that prompted me to exit. I may write afew lines on how I first became aware of a potential trade, how I feltentering and exiting, and so on. I try not to write a dissertation on everytrade, and record only the key factors, aiming for speed and brevity.\n271\nMy journal, a hard-cover spiral-bound album, sits on a bookshelf in my\ntrading room. I sometimes come into that room in the evening, sprawl inan armchair, and review my trades, one after another. Some pages arepleasant, others painful, but all are educational.\nAs you go looking for trades, please do not feel as if you have to find\nthe same patterns as shown here. This is just a brief excerpt from oneman’s diary—a few of the trades made in recent months. Also, trading isintensely personal, with different people reacting to different aspects ofthe game. There are many ways to make money in the markets and evenmore ways to lose it. My main purpose in showing you a few pages frommy diary is to prompt you to begin documenting your trades in order tolearn from your own experience.272 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nCOME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 273\nEXCERPTS FROM THE DIARY\nCharts in my trading diary are printed in color and marked up by hand.\nComments, written on margins, are telegraphic and abbreviated. In preparingthis manuscript for publication, I had to print those charts in black and whiterather than color, while slightly expanding my comments to make them eas-ier to understand.\nShowing strangers your trading diary feels almost like inviting them\ninto the bedroom during an intimate moment. As we grow older, we careless and less about what others think of us; I do not believe I could haveshown you my diary just a few years ago.\nThe key question is, What are you going to do with it? Will you casu-\nally flip through the pages? Will you go through them slowly, evaluatingeach trading signal? Will you feel overwhelmed? Will you feel critical,especially of trades with less than perfect scores? Before I turn my recordsof six recent trades over to you, I have just one question. Will you bekeeping your own diary? If my example has inspired you, I will haveachieved my goal.\n274 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nTrade 1—Long CSCO\nThe stock market has been falling for a year, accelerating in recent\nmonths. In a Traders’ Camp a month prior to this trade I asked a guestinstructor, a famous expert, what companies will be left standing at the\nbottom of a severe economic, as well as financial, decline, that is, what\nstocks to buy amid the ruins. His answer—BGEN, CSCO, and IBM. Iincluded all three in my weekly scan of the market.\nFigure 10.1 Weekly EntryTEAMFLY\nTeam-Fly®\nCOME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 275\nABC\nFigure 10.2 Daily Entry 1\nABC\nFigure 10.3 Daily Entry 2\nENTRY\nW eekly: CSCO has lost over 85% of its value, but this company is not\ngoing to disappear like some silly dot-com. Weekly trading ranges havebecome narrow; the bars near the right edge are only a couple of dol-lars wide, compared with $10 bars a year ago. This is a sign that spec-ulative excesses have been squeezed out. Weekly MACD-Histogramhas been rising for the past six weeks at the right edge—bullish. Weekly\nprice is as far below its EMA as it was above it at the top in 2000; the“rubber band” that connects price to the EMA is overextended, ready tosnap back.\nDaily: Massive bullish divergence between price and MACD-Histogram.\nSee how strong bears were at bottom A, weaker at bottom B, and now,at C, with prices much lower, bears hardly have any power. Moreover,there is a rarely seen bullish divergence B-C between price and MACD-Lines. Triple bullish divergence A-B-C between two-day Force Indexand price shows that each recent attempt to drive prices lower wasweaker than before. This divergence is shouting to buy now because itreveals that bears are out of steam and bulls are about to seize control.\nAction: Long on 4/9/2001 at 13.91, with a stop at 13.18, below the latest\nlow.276 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nCOME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 277\nAB\nFigure 10.4 Exit\nEXIT\nDaily: Prices snapped back slightly above their EMA, working off the over-\nsold condition, and appear to have stalled.

If you figure out what the leaders are doing, you can start lookingfor similar patterns in the laggards. A friend drew my attention to GXwhen she called to ask my opinion on a handful of stocks that she liked.Its patterns looked remarkably similar to CSCO, which was already run-ning in my favor.\nABC\nFigure 10.5 Weekly Entry\nCOME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 279\nAC\nAB\nFigure 10.7 Daily Entry 2\nAB\nFigure 10.6 Daily Entry 1\n280 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nENTRY\nW eekly: GX has lost over 80% of its value. Prices are as deep below their\nweekly EMA as they have ever been, just above the $10 psychologicalsupport level. Both MACD-Histogram and MACD-Lines are tracing mas-sive bullish divergences (A-B-C and B-C, respectively).\nDaily: Bullish divergence between MACD-Histogram and price A-B shows\nthat bears are becoming weaker, prices are falling out of inertia, and nogreat selling pressure exists. Seven trading days ago there was a falsebreakout below 10, and the rightmost bar is declining to retest thatlevel. The bottom of the previous week’s break provides a logical stop-loss point. The two-day Force Index is tracing a triple bullish diver-gence A-B-C, showing that bears have no force—it is a screaming buy.Expect prices to snap above their EMA.\nAction: Long on 4/16/2001 at 10.05, with a stop at 8.76, below the latest\nlow.\nCOME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 281\nA\nB\nFigure 10.8 Exit\nEXIT\nDaily: The rally is stalling, as prices have snapped back slightly above\ntheir EMA.

Once I presented my methods, we spent the bulk of the time apply-ing them to stocks chosen by campers. Out of dozens of stocks we analyzedthat weekend, none looked more appealing than PG. On Monday mor ning\nI went on-line and placed a buy order.\nFigure 10.9\nCOME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 283\nAB\nFigure 10.10\nBCD\nA\nFigure 10.11\nENTRY\nW eekly: Prices declining into support, weekly MACD-Histogram on the\nverge of completing a bullish divergence, while the broad market israllying.\nDaily: Bullish divergence of MACD-Histogram A-B with an extremely shal-\nlow second bottom B shows that bears are completely out of steam.The two-day Force Index shows both a longer-term bullish divergenceA-B-C-D since February and a short-term C-D at the right edge, givingthe final command to pull the trigger.

A deep bottom of the two-day Force Index near the rightedge reflects massive liquidation, which appears to be over, as prices ral-lied above support.

The work was hard, but I enjoyed the journey. Reading musthave been hard work for you, especially if you studied this book and didnot just skim. I wrote on several levels, and it will probably take you morethan one reading to grasp all its ideas and concepts. Expect to return andreview sections of this book in the months and years ahead, as your ex-pertise grows and new questions emerge.\nWe spent a lot of time together, but now our paths diverge.I’ve accomplished what I wanted, summarized my ideas on trading.\nLiberated from the word processor, I am off to pursue my passions, espe-cially trading and travel. I will spend more time in front of the screen,travel to faraway places, and if they have good Internet connections, I’lltrade from there, combining my interests.\nWhat will you do?You had your lessons in psychology, technical analysis, money man-\nagement, and record keeping. If you are serious about success, start apply-ing what you’ve learned. You have your work cut out for you.\nYour first task is to set up a record-keeping system. Keeping records is\nlike looking in a mirror while shaving with a very sharp blade. You’re saferif you look. Hammering on this topic reminds me how I once sent apatient to AA who told me that those meetings ruined him as an alcoholic.Getting drunk could never be fun again. Keeping records will do the samefor you—it will immunize you against impulsive gambling.\nYour next step is to set up a money management plan. Follow that by\nwriting down your trading plan, a decision-making tree. Once you do that,you’ll be moving in the direction opposite to the majority of the tradingpublic. Test everything you read in this or any other book. Only testingcan make any method your own.\nThose who concentrate on the rewards, which are considerable, often\npush themselves too hard. It is better to trade small in order to be morerelaxed and enjoy the learning process. Then you will emerge not onlyricher, but also more alert, aware, free, and at peace with yourself.\nI have traveled this road, made my choices, and battled my demons,\ngrowing from a wide-eyed beginner into someone who knows what he isdoing. The journey had many rough stretches, but both the trip and therewards are worth it.298 COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM\nClosing this book does not mean having to say good-bye. If I continue\nto run my Traders’ Camps, you may come to spend a week during whichwe’ll work on trading together. All new ideas in this book have first beenpresented to my campers, to whom my work is dedicated.\nIn writing this book I gave you my best and did not hold anything back.\nI hope you will give all of yourself to becoming a good trader. I nowreturn to my trading room and wish you success in yours.\nDr. Alexander Elder\nNew YorkFebruary 2002COME INTO MY TRADING ROOM 299\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWriting this page is like having a dessert—after working on this\nbook for more than three years, I get a chance to thank those\nwho helped me along the way.\nThanks, first of all, to my campers, the people to whom this book is\ndedicated. For the past several years I have been running Traders’Camps, becoming friends with some of the sharpest, most inquisitivepeople in the markets. Their questions forced me to dig deeper andarticulate my ideas more clearly. To this day, one of the highlights ofeach month is a meeting of campers in my apartment in Manhattan.\nI want to thank my staff, especially my manager, Inna Feldman. I\ntrust her to take good care of my clients while I am traveling or trad-ing overseas.\nFred Schutzman, an old and loyal friend, found time in his busy\nschedule to read the entire manuscript, and his eagle eye caught sev-eral oversights. Fred did a similar review of my previous book, Trading\nfor a Living. At its publication party I introduced him to the woman\nwho was my assistant manager. They started dating, married, and lastyear had their third child. Fred has a beautiful family, an unexpectedbonus for his hard work.\nMy best friend, Lou Taylor, to whom Trading for a Living was ded-\nicated, died more than a year before the current book was completed.His sage advice was priceless and his absence at the next book partywill feel like a huge void.\nMy older daughter Miriam, a journalist in Paris, helped edit this man-\nuscript. It seems like just a few years ago I was correcting her home-work, and now she takes a red pen to my pages. Her English and herstyle are impeccable; it looks like that homework paid off. My second\n301\ndaughter, Nika, an art historian in New York, another person with a\nrazor-sharp sense of taste, developed the design for the jacket of thebook. She also selected the fonts and made other suggestions toimprove the look and feel of the book. Both girls, as well as my young-est child Danny, provided many cheerful distractions from business. Ioften took them on trips, and since they like to sleep late, I had the timeto work on this book in the cafes of Venice, Fiji, New Zealand, andother locales, before a day of skiing or museum hopping.\nMy former manager, Carol Keegan Kayne, who edited all of my pre-\nvious books, reviewed page proofs of this one. She convinced me onceand for all that no book of mine is finished until she signs off on it.\nMy old friend Ted Bonanno insulated me from the most stressful part\nof writing a book—negotiating a publishing contract. Ted is an Olympicrowing coach (not long ago he went to the Sydney Olympics and Idid not go near the gym for three blessed weeks). We work outtogether, and it was fun discussing business with Ted while running orbetween rounds of weight lifting.\nLast but not least, I want to thank many friends around the world\nin whose beach, mountain, or city houses I sometimes stayed whilewriting this book. Since many of them are traders, I hope they bene-fited from the insights I shared with them as much as I enjoyed theirhospitality.\nDr. Alexander Elder\nNew YorkFebruary 2002302 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSOURCES\nAchelis, Steven.

The project, which\nspans three years, is the largest account that my company has ever won. Johnson Media Inc. will now\nbe one of the most prominent companies in the marketing industry.\nIn late July 2012 I received an e-mail and phone call from the vice president of a national\norganization who was impressed with my company’s work in the financial services industry. The vice\npresident asked us to submit a proposal for the organization’s major project. I agreed without\nhesitation.\nAlthough I was on vacation visiting my family in Chicago, I went right to work, summoning my\nteam to focus all efforts on winning this project. Also, I immediately reached out to two mentors\nwhose companies have made millions to get their support and guidance. My team and I finished our\nwinning proposal weeks before the deadline, giving the client the impression that we were all\nbusiness and that we made their project top priority. It paid off.\nI mention this major accomplishment because it is a testament to the effectiveness of the\nprinciples discussed in this book. In \nThe Entrepreneur Mind\n I detail how elite entrepreneurs respond\nquickly, put their business first, consult with mentors often, hire the best team, create an environment\nof stressful urgency, use time wisely, and so on. The one hundred lessons in this book are precisely\nthe basic principles that I have used to build a multimillion-dollar company at a young age.\nThis is not just another book on entrepreneurship that focuses on high-level theory or popular\nthought, but a pragmatic approach that will get you results. In your hands, you have a real playbook to\nhelp you accomplish your entrepreneurial dream, whether being able to determine your own destiny\nor winning a multimillion-dollar account. If you learn from my experiences and the lessons of high-\nperforming entrepreneurs, then you are on the path to success. If you adopt these principles and\nbelieve in them wholeheartedly, then success awaits you.\nIntroduction\nTo be an entrepreneur is to think differently. While most people seek refuge, entrepreneurs take\nrisks. They don’t want a job; they want to create jobs. Their goal isn’t to think outside the box as\nmuch as it is to own the box. Entrepreneurs don’t follow the market; they define the market. This bold\nand seemingly backward way of thinking I refer to as the Entrepreneur Mind.\nHow does one develop the Entrepreneur Mind? Debate about this question never ends. Everyone\nfrom scholars to entrepreneurs themselves wonder if consciously developing such a mind-set is even\npossible. Some people believe that entrepreneurs are born, that certain individuals are ordained to be\nentrepreneurs, gifted at birth with the right mix of characteristics and circumstances. Others believe\nthat entrepreneurs can be developed through a combination of coaching, education, and experience.\nThe idea that entrepreneurs are born, not made, is ridiculous. Contrary to what many erroneously\nbelieve, entrepreneurship \ncan\n be taught and learned. The fact that over six hundred thousand college\nstudents were enrolled in some type of entrepreneurship curriculum in 2011, up from less than 1\npercent of that amount a decade before, is a testament to the growing belief that entrepreneurship has\na respectable place in academia. In many ways, entrepreneurship is like any other major discipline\nthat requires intense study and practical experience.\nAlthough I didn’t have the benefit of studying entrepreneurship in a formal classroom setting, I\ndid learn by reading books, many of which I still have in my library and use as references. Trips to\nthe bookstore were a natural first step once I decided to go into business. With teeming excitement\nand eagerness I bought and read \nHigh-Tech Start Up: The Complete Handbook for Creating\nSuccessful New High-Tech Companies\n by John L. Nesheim. One of my favorite books was \nNetscape\nTime: The Making of the Billion-Dollar Start-Up That Took on Microsoft\n by Jim Clark. Books like\nthese formed the foundation of my education in entrepreneurship. Without them, I would have\nprobably given up from the frustration of trying to figure out everything on my own and to motivate\nmyself.\nThis book is an attempt to add a fresh and practical perspective to the wealth of knowledge\navailable about how to be an entrepreneur. As I developed as a young entrepreneur and experienced\ndifferent situations, I realized that few books offered the kind of succinct advice that I now give to my\nmentees. By telling my personal stories and relating those of other successful entrepreneurs, I set out\nto write a book that focuses on one hundred core lessons that teach entrepreneurs what they may not\nfind in a textbook, magazine, or online. These lessons include ranging from how to think big to why\nyou should use multiple banks, and even to whom you should choose as a spouse.\nFurthermore, my goal in writing this book is to help young entrepreneurs avoid the mistakes I\nmade. Mistakes during the early days of a business can be devastating. A bad decision such as\nspending too much money or choosing a bad business partner can lead to an entrepreneur having to\nshut down operations completely. After making some of my biggest mistakes, I would often think, \nI\nwish there were a book out there that would have warned me about this.\n Now that book exists, and I\ncan help people who may have that same wish.\nThis book is divided into seven parts: Strategy, Education, People, Finance, Marketing and\nSales, Leadership, and Motivation. Each part contains relevant nuggets of wisdom that you can read\nseparately or sequentially. Feel free to jump around based on your interests or read the book from\nbeginning to end.\nWhether you are thinking of starting a business, celebrating your first year in business, or\napproaching ten years in business, you’ll find tremendous value in reading this book. Simply put, it\nwill help you to develop the Entrepreneur Mind.\nChapter 1\nStrategy\nStrategy is a style of thinking, a conscious and deliberate process, an intensive implementation system, the science of ensuring future\nsuccess.\n—Pete Johnson, British businessman\nAll entrepreneurs must ask themselves three vital questions that concern their business strategy:\nWhere are we now? Where do we want to be? How do we get there?\n If you don’t know the answers\nto these questions, you don’t have a strategy for success. Instead, you have an aimless, business\npursuit and a likely failure on your hands.\nBusinesses with a clear and a solid strategy are prepared to win. Companies with inferior\nproducts often beat companies with superior products because, while the big dogs rest on their\nlaurels, the underdogs are implementing and executing a better strategy. In addition, they may have\nbetter partners, employ sharper lawyers, or automate more processes. A company’s strategy and\ntactics can help it surmount what seem like impassible obstacles.\nIn this chapter, you learn about strategies and tactics to improve your business, ranging from\ntesting a new market to devising an exit plan. Mastery of these important concepts will put your\nbusiness ahead of the rest.\n1) Think Big\nIt must be borne in mind that the tragedy in life doesn’t lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. . . .\nIt is not a disgrace not to reach the stars, but it is a disgrace to have no stars to reach for. Not failure, but low aim is sin.\n—Benjamin E. Mays, minister, educator, scholar, social activist\nThe Two Types of Failure in Business\nA business can fail in two ways: not surviving beyond its start and not reaching its full potential.\nWhile shutdowns receive the most attention, failure to reach full potential is much more catastrophic.\nOn the one hand, measuring and understanding why so many businesses fail in the traditional\nsense is relatively easy. We have the data. Organizations ranging from the Kauffman Foundation to the\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce have analyzed years of statistics, giving us a solid idea of why about 75\npercent of businesses do not survive fifteen years or more. Some of the reasons for failure include\nundercapitalization, overexpansion, poor planning, and a declining market.\nOn the other hand, measuring and understanding why a business fails to maximize its potential is\nquite difficult. Studies and statistics aren’t readily available. Also, the default measuring stick for\nsuccess in business is often the very existence of the business itself. I am guilty of perpetuating this\nlow expectation, frequently congratulating business owners for having survived their first five years.\nWhile this accomplishment is honorable, it’s more impressive to have a \nprofitable and a high-\ngrowth business\n after five years. Instead of flattering business owners who have reached a certain\nnumber of years, the goal should be to challenge and to help solid businesses ascend to the next level\n—to think big.\n“Thinking Big” Defined\nThe phrase “Think big” is ubiquitous, whether it’s from an ESPN commentator or Donald\nTrump. Likewise, a popular T-shirt carries the phrase, “Go big or go home!” Apparently, we have an\nepidemic of small thinkers, and we must be cured of this contagious inability to think big. Despite its\npopularity and ascendancy to pop culture status, the saying has no clear meaning, especially as it\nrelates to business.\nIn business, “thinking big” simply means pursuing ideas that maximize the scope of your\npotential. Likewise, it can mean pursuing ideas that have maximum impact in the world. Despite its\nsimple definition, thinking big is difficult to do for many reasons, but if you are aware of the obstacles\nyou can avoid them altogether.\n1. \nOne of the main obstacles to thinking big is the inability to outgrow your environment.\n I am\na mentor to several young entrepreneurs, and one of the common disappointments I have about my\nmentees is their inability to create businesses that go beyond the confines of their reality or\nenvironment. In other words, their environment restricts their thinking to the point that their business\nsuffers limited growth or even death.\nTo counter this effect I provide examples of entrepreneurs who have gone outside their\nenvironment to succeed. For example, many college students wish to start a business that targets only\ncollege students on their own campus. Instead, I encourage them to expand their markets by applying\ntheir product or service to additional segments. Students, for instance, could sell their product or\nservice to colleges across the nation or the world. If the idea has broad appeal, it could be even\nlarger. Also, I share with my college mentees how Facebook, originally for college students only,\nwas founded on an ideology that appeals to people all around the world. It was just a matter of time\nbefore Facebook’s cofounder Mark Zuckerberg expanded his company’s target from college students\nto everyone on the planet.\n2. \nMany entrepreneurs lack the motivation to pursue big ideas.\n I find this mentality prevalent\namong entrepreneurs who have had some level of monetary success in business that diminishes their\nwillingness to pursue bigger ideas. These entrepreneurs strive to maintain their comfort or have\nbecome accustomed to going for low-hanging fruit. As business author Michael Gerber says,\n“Comfort makes cowards of us all.” Moreover, these entrepreneurs could simply be overwhelmed\nwith running their own business and don’t have the bandwidth to do anything else.\nFor overcoming lack of motivation, entrepreneurs should find an individual or team to hold them\naccountable for pursing their big idea, step by step. I know that staying motivated can be difficult.\nHowever, having people hold me accountable for my goals has really worked. Moreover, if you have\nseveral businesses like I do, you have to delegate tasks to others and carve out priority time to\ndevelop your idea. Otherwise, you make little progress.\n3. \nSeveral entrepreneurs lack the self-confidence to think big.\n They don’t see themselves\nrunning a large organization, or they are frozen by the immensity of their idea. They may ask\nthemselves, \nWhere do I start? How will I build a team capable of pulling this off? Where will I get\nthe start-up capital for such a huge idea?\nTo boost your self-confidence, devise and take small steps that start you working on your idea.\nFor example, do some basic research about your idea or write down your ideas. If you are like most\npeople, these small wins will add up to increase your confidence and to propel you forward.\n4. \nEntrepreneurs often lack the diversity and expertise of influencers required to think and\neventually to execute in a big way.\n I am a fan of the television show \nShark Tank\n in which\nentrepreneurs pitch their business idea to a panel of investors, or sharks, who then decide whether to\nplace an investment with the presenting company. Entrepreneurs who appear on the show seek\ninvestment capital as much as the valuable experience of the sharks. In one episode, a shark suggested\nthat an entrepreneur license his product instead of selling it to individual retailers, an arduous\nprocess. The entrepreneur had not thought about licensing his product, a strategy that would yield him\nprofits faster and minimize risk. In this case like so many others, the founder needed the experience\nand influence of seasoned entrepreneurs to maximize the potential of a business idea.\nTo jump this hurdle, you must establish a diverse network of individuals who think big and\nunderstand what it takes to arrive at that level. Likewise, they can help you to vet and improve your\nidea. Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, recently told a group of aspiring entrepreneurs in\nCambridge, England, “Talk to as many people as you can. What you want are the people who will tell\nyou what’s wrong with your idea. They are the ones you can learn from.”\nMy First Big Idea\nLike many of my college mentees today, I was unable to think big during my early start-up days,\nbecause I was limited by my environment. Also, my network at the time didn’t include older\nentrepreneurs who could help me translate the value of my college website to a larger, more\nprofitable audience. By the time I realized the great potential of my idea, it was too late. Well-funded\nand talented competitors seized the larger market aggressively while I focused on increasing my\nsuccess in my small-college microcosm. Had circumstances been different, I could have been a\nformidable competitor to companies like CollegeClub.com, or even Facebook itself.\nDespite the missed opportunity of becoming a national or even global college web portal, all\nwas not lost. Eager to move on from serving the college market and making my mark in a bigger area,\nI stumbled upon an opportunity that would forever change how I pursue business ideas. I decided to\nfocus on commercializing an internal tool that I created to help my staff update web pages without\nhaving to know computer programming languages. OmniPublisher, one of the first online content\nmanagement systems—similar to an early WordPress—was my first product with global appeal.\nFrom that point I began to think big and never returned to thinking small.\nWe sold OmniPublisher to local community newspapers and other publishers to simplify making\nfrequent updates to their websites and to automate archiving with a portable database. OmniPublisher\nalso helped users with small budgets to obtain enterprise-like software that normally would cost them\nmuch more to build or to purchase from an established vendor. My company had regional success\nwith the project and eventually sold OmniPublisher to a small publishing company. During an early\nconsolidation period, companies with software similar to my company’s were acquired for millions\nof dollars. My dream of selling to a large media conglomerate at a higher valuation didn’t come\nthrough, but I sleep well at night knowing that I dreamed big and went for it.\nWhere Thinking Big Helps the Most\nI contend that the aggregate loss of value by businesses that fail to reach their potential is much\ngreater than the value lost by businesses that cease to exist. Some compelling statistics support this\nposition, as reported in a recent Technology Association of Georgia (TAG) proposal:\nAccording to the YourEconomy.org website (created by the Edward Lowe Foundation from\nDun and Bradstreet data), from 2000–2007, most new job creations in the United States\nwere provided by Stage I (1–9 employees) companies (approximately 5.7 million).\nHowever, over this period of time, new jobs by Stage I companies were created at a rate of\n1.5 per new company, whereas Stage II (10–99 employees) companies created new jobs at\na rate of 26 per new company. The website further indicates that since 2000, Stage IV (500\nor more employees) companies have yet to create one new net job. Instead, they have lost\napproximately 2.5 million jobs.\nFor this reason, economists, entrepreneurs, and others interested in economic development should not\nnecessarily emphasize fostering start-up growth. Instead, they must emphasize helping established\nbusinesses and leaders transform their operations from medium to large. In other words, increasing\nthe number of new start-ups is less important than ensuring the full maturation of established\ncompanies that have tremendous and sustainable growth potential.\nHow do we move medium-sized businesses to become big enterprises? Many economic\ndevelopers are asking themselves that question today and are working diligently to answer it. One\napproach, economic gardening, is addressing the challenge and seeing great results, especially in\nFlorida. As defined by the Kauffman Foundation, \neconomic gardening\n is an economic development\nmodel that embraces the fundamental idea that entrepreneurs drive economies. The model seeks to\ncreate jobs by supporting existing companies in a community. Economic gardening also develops an\nentrepreneur’s mental ability to think big and provides resources to make it happen.\nMaking the jump from thinking small to thinking big can be extremely difficult, but it is worth it.\nIn fact, all of the greatest achievements of humanity started with a daring, big idea. Imagine where\nwe’d be if the inspiring words of the great Benjamin E. Mays that encourage us to think big hadn’t\ninspired a young student at Morehouse College who dreamed of living in a different world than the\none in which he found himself. Martin Luther King Jr., one of the most known icons in the world\ntoday, could have settled for being just a preacher in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. He never\nwould have set out to accomplish his dream, a vision that changed our world forever. People with the\nability and the audacity to think big carve the path to greatness.\n2) Create New Markets\nIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\n—Henry Ford, founder, Ford Motor Company\nThe two kinds of entrepreneurs are those who create markets and those who do not. On the one hand,\nthe entrepreneur who creates markets is considered a revolutionary. On the other hand, the\nentrepreneur who competes in well-established markets is considered ordinary. Both approaches can\nlead to success in business, but research indicates that the creative entrepreneur has a better strategic\nposition.\nBlue Ocean Strategy\n, a best-selling business book, makes a cogent argument that creating new\nmarkets known as “blue oceans” is better than competing in overcrowded industries known as “red\noceans.” The authors, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, studied 150 strategic moves spanning\nmore than one hundred years and 30 industries for their book. They also looked at 108 companies that\nlaunched new businesses to quantify the impact on revenue growth and profits of creating blue\noceans. Kim and Mauborgne’s findings are remarkable:\nWe found that 86 percent of the launches were line extensions, that is, incremental\nimprovements within the red ocean of existing market space. Yet they accounted for only 62\npercent of total revenues and a mere 39 percent of total profits. The remaining 14 percent of\nthe launches were aimed at creating blue oceans. They generated 38 percent of total\nrevenues and 61 percent of total profits.\nAccording to these data, it pays to create blue oceans. The book gives solid examples of successful\ncompanies that created new markets, including Yellow Tail, Cirque du Soleil, Ralph Lauren, and\nLexus. It also provides a step-by-step process for executing blue ocean strategy. I highly recommend\nthat you buy a copy of the book.\nAs a mentor to young entrepreneurs, I encourage my mentees to seek new markets rather than to\ngo into well-established ones. The potential for attaining greatness is in creating new markets. My\nfirst start-up was a blue ocean, or a blue pond considering the size of my market. In my microcosm of\na college campus, I created a web portal that enabled students to interact in ways like never before.\nAs a result, advertisers flocked to take advantage of my platform. Moreover, I encourage my mentees\nto study some of our greatest and wealthiest entrepreneurs to learn how they were able to identify and\nto dominate new markets.\nGoing down the list of \nForbes\n magazine’s wealthiest four hundred Americans, you read the\nnames of many entrepreneurs who have created and led in markets that before were nonexistent.\nMichael Bloomberg, for example, started his company after being fired from an investment bank in\n1981 and was a pioneer in providing high-quality financial data to Wall Street banks and traders.\nBefore Bloomberg L.P., no company provided this valuable data quickly and in several different\nformats. Likewise, Jeff Bezos’s Amazon.com revolutionized the way consumers buy books and other\nproducts. The list continues with names like Michael Dell, Phil Knight (cofounder of Nike), George\nLucas, and more.\nWhich kind of entrepreneur are you? If you have a blue ocean, you are on your way to\ntremendous success. However, if you are competing in a red ocean, it’s time to adopt strategies to\nspawn innovation, leading your company to significant profits and to a sustainable competitive\nadvantage.\n3) Work on Your Business, Not in Your Business\nIf your business depends on you, you don’t own a business—you have a job.\n—Michael Gerber, author, \nThe E-Myth\nIt was one of the greatest feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction I have ever had. After a long\nand difficult process of searching for the right people, every essential role in my publishing business\nwas filled. No longer did I have to sell ads, do layout, edit articles, or distribute my magazine. My\nstaff of almost twenty people took care of everything from determining a new issue’s concept to\ndelivering it to readers. I didn’t even have to look at the final printed magazine if I didn’t want to. I\ncould now focus on how to grow the magazine from a regional publication to a national one.\nUntil an entrepreneur’s company runs without the founder, that person is just self-employed, the\nlowest rung in the hierarchy of entrepreneurs. The unfortunate reality for millions of entrepreneurs is\nthat their business depends on them way too much. You know the type, and perhaps that type\ndescribes you. They are often overwhelmed with their business, doing everything from their own\ntaxes to taking out the trash. They work nonstop not because they want to but because they have to.\nThey may act as though they have a team that takes care of everything, but they don’t. It’s all just a\nfaçade. The harsh reality is that if they were hit by a bus and died, their business would die, too.\nJust because you \nhave\n the ability to assume a crucial role in your business doesn’t mean you\nshould\n. In a recent conversation I had, a fellow entrepreneur boasted about his entrepreneurial\nfrugality as if it were an admirable quality. Normally it is, but he took it too far. He enthusiastically\nbragged, “Why should I pay someone for something I can do myself?” That’s usually code for “I don’t\nhave money to pay someone else to do the work.” If you don’t have the revenues to hire a team and to\nreplace yourself, your business isn’t profitable, and perhaps you should consider a different approach\nor a different business altogether. Doing everything in your business yourself leads to a quick burnout,\nand the activity prevents you from executing your role as an entrepreneur: working on your business,\nnot in it.\nBefore you even start your business, focus on planning how to get rid of yourself, especially if\nthe business is service-oriented and you are the one serving. This outlook is absolutely imperative\nbecause once the business gets going, you won’t have time to dedicate to planning when work piles\nup. You naturally will give priority to serving clients and generating revenue rather than planning\nyour replacement.\nFinding quality people to fill all-important roles puts you in the frame of mind of running a\nbusiness. In this mode, you are really an entrepreneur, and that’s what it is all about. Once you have\nsuccessfully eliminated the dependency of your business on you—and the process won’t be quick and\neasy—you can focus on growing your business or even moving on to your next venture.\nI have seen it happen time after time: Entrepreneurs start a company, hoping to be free from the\ntyranny and demands of a regular job, and before long they are weary from having to do everything\nfor their business. In fact, many are miserable. Either they failed to extricate themselves before it\nbecame really difficult to do so, or they just can’t seem to let go and get away. If you desire to pass\nthe primary level of self-employment and reach the upper echelons of entrepreneurship, learn to\ndelegate quickly. Otherwise, your chances of growth are limited significantly. If you want guaranteed,\nlimited growth, you might as well get a job.\n4) All Risk Isn’t Risky\nRisk comes from not knowing what you are doing.\n—Warren Buffett, businessman, investor, philanthropist\nAmong the several definitions of an “entrepreneur,” some are pretty good while others are downright\nterrible. Regardless, a common word among them seems to be “risk,” which is what truly defines an\nentrepreneur. The following simple definition by \nMerriam\n-\nWebster\n is one of the best: “An\nentrepreneur is one who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise.”\nThe focus then becomes understanding risk and how it factors into being an entrepreneur. “Risk,”\nas defined by the same dictionary, is the “possibility of loss.” What’s most interesting about this\ndefinition—and contrary to popular belief—is that it doesn’t impart a negative value judgment; the\ndefinition merely declares the possibility of loss. In other words, an event can have a 1 percent or a\n99 percent probability of loss. Our response to and interpretation of those two levels of risk make all\nthe difference.\nEntrepreneurs have a higher tolerance for risk than the average person when it comes to starting\nand running a business. According to the Kauffman Foundation, less than 80 percent of businesses last\nafter their fifth year of existence. Moreover, according to Saratoga Venture Finance, less than 1\npercent of businesses ever go public. Despite these daunting odds, entrepreneurs are not deterred\nfrom pursuing their goals.\nThis higher tolerance of risk among entrepreneurs, though, doesn’t tell the whole story.\nEntrepreneurs surely take on high probabilities of failure, but they don’t necessarily like to gamble.\nInstead, they take calculated risks, stacking the deck in their favor. They find ways to minimize or to\nspread the risk of their endeavor to increase the odds of their success or minimize the odds of loss.\nEntrepreneurs have the confidence in themselves to avoid and to overcome obstacles that could cause\ngreat loss, whether through expert knowledge, solid relationships, or even personal wealth.\nFor example, the media tend to emphasize the Cinderella stories of CEOs who have achieved\ngreat success despite unfavorable odds. However, a closer look at these stories often reveals that the\nCEOs took calculated risks and had solid backup plans. In his book \nThe Reluctant Entrepreneur\n,\nMichael Masterson describes how Bill Gates is frequently perceived as a college dropout who took a\nhuge risk to start Microsoft. Masterson criticizes this perspective and paints a very practical picture\nof Gates, one that portrays him as a methodical, brilliant youngster who always planned to return to\nschool if his business venture didn’t work out. Perhaps Gates’s decision to leave Harvard would\nhave been riskier and thus worthy of the media spin if he weren’t so smart and didn’t have the great\nfinancial resources that his well-heeled parents gave him.\nIn short, all risk isn’t risky, and entrepreneurs know this rule. Put another way, the reality of\nbecoming an entrepreneur isn’t so much about the high probability or risk of failure as much as your\nability to beat the odds. Ironically, the entire world has learned this lesson from the Great Recession.\nThe opposite of this rule is just as valid. What people thought was safe is no longer as safe as they\nthought. College won’t guarantee you a high-paying job in the field you studied once you graduate. A\ncorporate job doesn’t mean you won’t get fired. Enrolling in your company’s 401(k) plan doesn’t\nmean that you will have more money in the bank than when you started the plan. If the world continues\non a path of economic decline, pursuing your entrepreneurial dreams will be less risky than getting a\njob. And that’s not such a bad thing.\n5) Don’t Waste Time\nProcrastination is opportunity’s natural assassin.\n—Victor Kiam, entrepreneur; former owner, New England Patriots\nI had lunch recently with one of my mentees who just graduated from college. Now that school is\noccupying less of his time, he wanted to meet and get some guidance about what to do next. He and a\ncouple of his friends from college started a company over a year ago that finally seemed to be gaining\nsome traction.\nAlthough he has great potential, my mentee disappointed me with his lack of effort and sense of\nurgency. During our meeting, he asked me mostly the same questions he asked during our last meeting\neleven months ago. He took thorough notes from that meeting, but had made no progress toward\nfollowing any of the crucial steps I suggested to propel his business forward. In fact, he had done\nabsolutely nothing of major significance. He offered no valid excuses for his lack of progress, putting\nhis head down and repeating, “Yeah. I have to get moving.” Frustrated, I simply gave him the same\ninformation from before and admonished him to follow immediately the advice I gave him. I am\nafraid that my words went in one ear and out the other.\nAfter our two-hour meeting, I began to think about what his poor follow-through and hesitation\nmeant. To better understand, I recalled how I felt about pursing my entrepreneurial endeavors while\nin college and shortly after graduating. My sense of urgency to create a profitable business was\nalmost an obsession. Some people would say it was indeed an obsession, as I was always running\nhome to code and to add a feature to my website. I didn’t have time for anything else except for doing\nthe necessary tasks to move my business forward. School, a demanding girlfriend, and the desire to\nhang out with my friends were no obstacle for me. I made it happen regardless of the circumstances. I\ncertainly wasn’t going to wait around and do nothing. Even as I worked hard on growing my\ncompany, I felt like time was slipping away, like a competitor was just waiting for me to make a\nmistake.\nThe best entrepreneurs create environments of stressful urgency. Entrepreneurs know that start-\nups rarely get anything done in a relaxed, take-your-time environment. For example, Steve Jobs, the\ncofounder of Apple, was notorious for pushing his team beyond its limits by setting seemingly\nunrealistic timelines. As a result, his company created products quicker than they had ever imagined\nwas possible and thus gained a huge competitive advantage over rival companies like IBM.\nDoctors and psychologists believe that stress caused by time constraints or urgency has an\nupside. In fact, they argue that we all need stress in our lives to perform certain tasks at a high level,\nranging from avoiding a car accident to finishing a report for work. A recent MSNBC.com article\nexplored the benefits of stress: “When the brain perceives physical or psychological stress, it starts\npumping the chemicals cortisol, epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine into the body. Instantly,\nthe heart beats faster, blood pressure increases, senses sharpen, a rise in blood glucose invigorates us\nand we’re ready to rock.” The article also quoted Janet DiPietro, a developmental psychologist at the\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health: “When you have a deadline, when you have to\nperform, you want some stress to help you do your best.”\nIf you lack the sense of urgency to grow your business, evaluate why you want to be in business.\nPerhaps you are not passionate about the business idea. Maybe your subconscious tells you that the\nidea isn’t worth pursuing. Maybe the idea isn’t yours and you feel no allegiance to it, or maybe you\nlack the self-discipline to be an entrepreneur. Whatever the reason, your lack of enthusiasm is not a\ngood sign.\nBefore our meeting ended, my mentee gave me a clue as to why he called the meeting even if it\nseemed he hadn’t been making progress. He revealed that he had to make money to support himself\nsoon and that he had been offered a decent job that he doesn’t necessarily want to take. I had a much\nbetter understanding of his circumstance and his sudden sense of urgency. It was telling. I concluded\nthe meeting by reiterating that he should be working harder than ever to grow his company because\ntime is running out. However, experience and entrepreneurial intuition tell me that he will end up\ngetting a job working for someone else. He wasted too much valuable time.\n6) Build a Company That Is Systems-Dependent, Not People-\nDependent\nSystems are the essential building blocks of every successful business.\n—Ron Carroll, entrepreneur, business coach\nAs a computer science major in college matriculating with some of the brightest students from around\nthe world, I quickly learned that my computer programming skills were not the most economical. I\ncould get the job done, but not in the most efficient way. I would take one hundred lines of computer\nprogramming code to do something that my peers could do in ten. Such efficiency translates into faster\nprograms and smaller-sized files. I eventually improved my programming skills because success in\ntechnologically related fields relies largely on the ability to implement efficient systems and\nmethodologies.\nThe pioneer in creating systems that increase work efficiency was Henry Ford, founder of the\nFord Motor Company. Ford created an assembly-line system that enabled him to mass-produce the\nModel T car. Before his introduction of the assembly line in 1913, a small team of specialists made\ncars, and the process was lengthy. Ford’s methods, though, reduced the time from more than twelve\nhours to two hours and thirty minutes. His innovation put the car in the economic reach of an average\nfamily and improved productivity rates across many industries.\nNot only did Ford’s system boost productivity, but it also cut the need for the jack-of-all-trades.\nInstead, workers on the assembly line could be specialized, which also made them easier to replace.\nBefore the assembly line, if an employee who built most of a car was out sick, productivity would\nslow down and the arduous process of building a car by hand would be much more difficult to\ncontinue.\nI didn’t understand the importance of building and implementing systems in business until my\ncompany had become too dependent on people. For instance, when I started my first popular website\nin college, I learned that a growing business that relied totally on me wasn’t sustainable. I would\neventually burn out and be unable to serve the growing number of users. And if, for some reason, I\ncouldn’t run the business, it wasn’t clear who would do what to keep it going. I had to make a change.\nConsequently, I created a content management tool to expedite web updates and give me more time,\nbut even that wasn’t enough after a while. I was growing too fast and needed to bring on other people.\nThe need for a clear system and way of doing things was obvious.\nAs a result of these growing pains, I learned to do two things when I begin a business venture:\nFirst, clearly separate and describe the roles in the business in written form. Second, use technology\nto map out and build systems that simplify and automate important tasks.\nEven if you are a one-person show, take the time to delineate the roles and expectations that\npeople in your business will play. Write a job description for crucial positions like CEO, CFO, vice\npresident of sales, vice president of operations, and so on. You may be doing one, two, or all of these\nroles at the start, but this activity forces you to conceptualize how each role, not an individual person,\nrelates to your business. As alluded to earlier, people come and go, but the functions needed to keep\nyour business going do not.\nMoreover, using technology, create process maps to visualize how you will execute different\ntasks. This step helps you determine where your processes can be improved and see where\ntechnology can make your processes more efficient. For example, my company uses several tools to\nhelp automate social media campaigns. Powerful tools like HootSuite enable users to manage several\nsocial media accounts through one interface, and its functionality automates messages. One person can\ndo the work of tens or hundreds of people. This technology has made my company more efficient,\nsaving valuable time and increasing revenues.\nBeing a start-up doesn’t mean you have to operate haphazardly and without systems. While some\ndegree of organizational chaos is unavoidable, you should still create, think through, and continually\noptimize your systems so that you are less dependent on people. Taking this step up front puts you\nfurther along the path to reaching your goals and allows you to know you’re in the mode of building a\ncompany.\n7) Ask for Help\nTell everyone what you want to do and someone will want to help you do it.\n—W. Clement Stone, businessman, philanthropist\nWhen I arrived at Morehouse College, where I would spend four crucial years of my life, I had a huge\nchip on my shoulder. About a year before my arrival, Morehouse offered and I had accepted a full\nacademic scholarship to study computer science. My scholarship was funded by NASA and was\nintended to groom outstanding math and science majors to work in the space program upon\ngraduation. That summer before classes officially began in August, I took part in a mandatory, six-\nweek orientation program for the thirty or so NASA scholars at Morehouse. We were the elite\nstudents, and we knew it. Along with high SAT scores and GPAs, we had extremely high opinions of\nourselves. These opinions would change quickly.\nWhat we thought would be an easy summer filled with newfound independence and fun became a\nsummer of torture. During the program, we took college courses, including advanced calculus and\nadvanced computer programming. Our calculus class was taught by a stern alumnus who was the\nstereotypical difficult professor. There was never a right answer. Even when a student offered a\ncorrect answer in class, the professor would ask us, “Is this answer correct?” Going to class was like\nhaving your fingernails pulled out one by one. Our computer science professor was equally\nintimidating. He had a different approach, though. He was a soft-spoken, jovial guy, but he would\nlaugh at you and make fun of you if you gave a wrong answer. And he would often digress, talking\nabout life in general. The worst thing about the summer classes was our grades. For example, in our\ncalculus class, the best grade on the first quiz was a 55, I think. My grade was closer to my age. It\nwouldn’t get much better. The material, pace, and pressure were too hard. The NASA Project Space\nProgram knew exactly what it was doing. It broke us down and it humbled us.\nAs a result, we were all scared to death of college and studied harder than ever to prepare for\nthe first day of real classes in August. Students who had never struggled academically were on the\nverge of a breakdown at the NASA program. There was mass panic, but everyone tried to play it\ncool. Some of us formed study groups and curtailed our social activities. Many of us questioned our\nability and fortitude to survive and to make it through college. Some bailed before the six-week\nprogram was over.\nThis period was especially difficult for me. Through high school I rarely had to ask for help in\nmy courses. If something gave me trouble, I would figure it out. Now I had to ask for help—and from\npeers—something I wasn’t comfortable doing at all. I thought that this was a sign of weakness, and\nmy reluctance to ask for help caused me to pay a high academic price.\nI learned my lesson as a student thanks to NASA, and I vowed not to make the same mistake\nwhen I became a CEO in business. In fact, seconds after I came up with my first business idea as a\nsophomore, I asked for help. I contacted my good friend and fellow NASA scholar, Chris, to hear\nwhat he thought about my company’s new name and domain name. Also, before I started another\ncollege business, I invited about five entrepreneurs to an evening meeting to discuss my business idea\nand to get their feedback and help. I made it a habit to ask for help from day one. Many of these same\npeople continue to give me their guidance today, more than ten years later. The help I have asked for\nand received has been invaluable to my company’s growth and my personal development. Before\nlong, asking for help became natural. I just had to get rid of my ego.\nWhen you start your business, lose the ego immediately. It’s the main reason that entrepreneurs\ndon’t seek help. An overinflated ego even prevents those who ask for help from receiving it. Rarely\ndo people want to help those who act as though they don’t need it. And there’s a difference between\nbeing confident and having an ego that’s too big for your own good. Confidence attracts people; ego\nrepels them.\nOne of the quickest ways to lead a life of mediocrity or utter failure is to think that you can\naccomplish a major task all by yourself. The self-made man or woman is a myth. Even the greatest\nbusiness minds of our time had to ask for help. One of my favorite examples is that of Mark\nZuckerberg, who asked his parents to help finance his young company, Thefacebook. His parents gave\nhim $85,000 in the summer of 2004 to help buy servers for his growing business. This money,\naccording to a lawsuit, was intended for his college tuition. It doesn’t hurt to ask, right? Whether it’s\nyour oversized ego or your tendency to be introverted that’s stopping you, go beyond your comfort\nzone and ask for help. Your business depends on it.\n8) Business Comes First, Family Second\nGood things happen when you get your priorities straight.\n—Scott Caan, actor\nI am almost 100 percent sure that the concept of putting business before family has caused me to lose\nsome followers on Twitter, or at least it has given some of my followers a negative perception of me.\nWho in the world admits to putting their business before their family? To the average person, this\nnotion is ludicrous and totally not politically correct.\nWhen I first tweeted about how my business comes first and family second, I received the\nfollowing comments: “You lost some friends on that one.” “I disagree. I always put my family first.” I\ncringed when I saw these and other comments pop up in my Twitter feed. I certainly don’t like to\ninvite controversy, but I think people who aren’t die-hard entrepreneurs miss my point. I don’t blame\nthem necessarily, because I can’t explain my reasoning within the 140 characters that Twitter allows.\nIronically, I didn’t receive any backlash from seasoned entrepreneurs. Something tells me they\nunderstood.\nSome of the pushback on this comment came from people who work a normal job. The irony of\ntheir comments was overwhelming. Some said, “I always put family first.” I doubt it. If they wanted\nto take off a year to take care of a sick parent and relied on the income of their job, they couldn’t do\nit. They would get fired. They are beholden to the employer.\nWhy do top-performing entrepreneurs put their businesses first? I’ll use an analogy to explain.\nWhen informing passengers of emergency procedures on airplanes, flight attendants always tell adult\npassengers traveling with a child to put on their oxygen mask first before they put one on a child. It’s\ncounterintuitive, but it makes sense when you think about it. Children depend on adult passengers to\nprotect them because they cannot put on their own mask. If you do not follow this procedure, you\ncould lose consciousness before giving a child a chance to live. This simple step saves lives.\nSimilarly, business is a life-or-death situation. If you don’t take care of your business first, everyone\ncould eventually “die.” As my father often says, quoting a Bible passage, if you don’t work, you don’t\neat.\nLikewise, I love how financial guru Suze Orman discourages parents from starting a college fund\nfor their children if they don’t have adequate savings. She admonishes them, saying, “Slow down!\nYour children will be better off if your finances are in order first.”\nNow that I’ve explained putting business first, let’s take a step back. I don’t follow this rule\nabsolutely. Of course, there are some exceptions: I wouldn’t miss a close family member’s funeral,\nfor example. However, if I am about to close a million-dollar deal and my son asks me to play catch\nthat evening, my son will have to take a rain check. It’s not cruel; it’s common sense. Though he may\nbe disappointed in the short term, he’ll really appreciate the income later—perhaps in the form of\nreceiving front-row seats at the Braves game right next to baseball legend Hank Aaron.\nOne of the biggest advantages of entrepreneurship is independence and flexibility to prioritize. If\nyour business is doing well, you deserve to take more breaks and to spend quality time with family. If\nnot, you should be hard at work, making sure that you can provide for your family and generations to\ncome.\n9) Do What’s Most Important First\nThe key is not to prioritize what’s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.\n—Stephen Covey, best-selling author, \nThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\nWhen I began learning how to play golf a few years ago, it was much harder than I thought it would\nbe. Of all the different mental and physical things needed to execute a good swing, I had the most\ndifficulty keeping my head down through the swing. I almost always lifted my head before making\ncontact with the ball and therefore took a bad swing. Sometimes I missed the ball altogether. It was so\nchallenging because keeping my head down felt so unnatural. It was completely counterintuitive.\nLikewise, doing the tasks that are most important in business is counterintuitive. Normally, these\ncrucial tasks demand more time, energy, and focus than we care to give. Thus, we avoid them, doing\nthose simpler tasks that really don’t have a major impact on our business. Like a novice golfer who\nstruggles with the basics, many entrepreneurs can’t seem to master the habit of doing what’s most\nvaluable for their business. This basic discipline is the key to continued success as an entrepreneur.\nIf you are like most entrepreneurs, the lure of crossing something off your task list is too great to\npass up. As you bask in the happiness of having crossed off another menial task, the more important\ntasks are pushed further down your to-do list and often forgotten. It’s ironic how the most important\nitems keep getting put off and therefore become, in reality, a low priority. We fool ourselves into\nbelieving that we are actually making significant progress by doing several little things.\nOn the contrary, veteran and smart entrepreneurs give priority to those tasks that are painful but\nwhich pay off in the end. They have the ability to ignore the fleeting satisfaction that may come from\nfinishing small tasks. As a result, they seem to have the unique ability to accomplish so much more in\na smaller time span. They don’t have superpowers. Instead, they have super priorities and habits that\nmake it easier to do what’s most important.\nA few simple tips can help you focus on the most important tasks that will take your business to\nnew heights.\n1. \nDo important tasks first thing in the morning when you get up.\n This is perhaps the most\nuseful habit that has helped me become much more efficient. If I am working on a book, writing\nmusic, doing research, or producing computer code, my mind is freshest in the morning. Also, with\nfewer distractions in the morning, your focus is at its best.\n2. \nChange your environment.\n Sometimes all you need to boost your productivity is a change in\nenvironment. If you work at home, steal away to a small park, or if you are in an office, go to a cafe.\nIt’s amazing how something so simple can improve your output. Some environments may\nsubconsciously cause you to have more anxiety or stress than others. Identify and avoid them. Who\nknows? When you change your surroundings, maybe you’ll receive an infusion of creativity like never\nbefore. It has happened to me.\n3. \nDisconnect from the real world.\n Don’t check your e-mail before or during work. Turn off the\ntelevision and telephone. These interrupters cloud your focus. Research has shown that multitasking\nnegatively affects your productivity. Also, the brain is most effective when it focuses on doing one\nthing.\n4. \nTake substantive breaks.\n Do something that takes your mind completely off the task at hand.\nFor example, I like to go for a run, go get the mail, or dance. Moving around helps me rejuvenate and\ngets my blood flowing. Whatever you do, don’t take a break by staying at your desk or by staying in\nthe same room where you work. Definitely change your scenery, and if you can, do a physical activity\nfor at least five minutes.\nNow that I have learned to keep my head down through my swing, my golf game has improved\nconsiderably. In fact, what was once uncomfortable and unnatural has become second-nature.\nSimilarly, if you follow the preceding tips, your business game will improve, too. You will start to\naccomplish a lot more, and doing what’s most important will be automatic.\n10) Hire a Good Lawyer\nA good business attorney will provide vital assistance in almost every aspect of your business.\n—Cliff Ennico, author, \nThe Small Business Survival Guide\nIf you’ve been in business long enough, sooner or later you will need sound legal advice from an\nattorney. Yes, you can use an Internet legal services firm, but you’ll eventually need face-to-face\ncounsel. Here are three common uses for legal services among start-ups and a few real-life examples\nof how an attorney helped my company.\nFirst, \nwhen you are ready to start your business, an attorney will recommend a legal entity\nthat is best for you.\n Do you set up a sole proprietorship, a C corporation, an S corporation, a limited\nliability company, or a limited liability partnership? Which is best?\nWhen I started my company years ago, an attorney gave me wise advice. He suggested that I\nconsider the long-term implications and flexibility of the legal entity I chose. He recommended that I\nselect the entity that best fit my long-term vision for the company. A sole proprietorship, for instance,\nwould not be the best option for a founder who plans to sell shares in the future. Of course, I could\nchange classifications, but an extra cost is involved. Ideally, select the best option in the beginning\nand keep it.\nAlthough you can find plenty of information online about different business classifications,\ndiscuss your specific situation with an attorney who can assess your needs and ultimately help you\nmake the right decision.\nSecond, \nan attorney helps you protect your intellectual property (IP).\n There is a good reason\nyou cannot take The Coca-Cola Company’s name and logo and use it to sell a beverage product—or\nany product for that matter. Not only is such behavior unscrupulous, it is also illegal. Specifically, it\nviolates U.S. trademark law. In the same way that The Coca-Cola Company needs to protect its\nintellectual property, you want to protect yours. Intellectual property, defined generally as creations\nof the mind, includes mainly patents, copyrights, and trademarks.\nProtecting my company’s IP has saved me from costly litigation and frustration. Because of the\npopularity of my company’s brands, we have had to deal with many impostors who try to capitalize\non our success by stealing our IP. The perpetrators have ranged from publicly traded companies to\ncareless individuals. For example, one company literally used our trademark to produce an event by\nthe same exact name in the same city as our headquarters. My attorney promptly advised me to send\nthe company a cease-and-desist letter, demanding that the company immediately stop using our\ntrademark or it would risk litigation. The company complied with our request. Had we not the proper\nlegal advice and proof of ownership of the trademark, we would have had much less recourse.\nIf you believe in the value of your products and services, protect your IP from the very start, no\nmatter the cost. Many start-ups fail to protect their IP because of the relatively high cost. Cutting\ncorners now costs more later. In particular, you could be forced to change your product’s branding,\nrestricted to sell in specific regions, or ordered to pay damages to someone suing you for abusing\ntheir own IP.\nThird, \nan attorney reviews the legal documents your company creates and receives from\nothers to ensure that your interests are protected.\n These documents may include contracts,\nagreements, and insurance policies.\nAs mentioned earlier, my attorney recently reviewed correspondence with companies that had\ninfringed on our trademarks. Her insight and guidance were crucial to a quick and favorable result in\nthe matters.\nBy the way, many generic contracts can be found online for use, but be careful. These contracts\nmay not provide you as much protection as you need. In fact, some of the contracts could do more\nharm than good. Generic contracts are sometimes a good start, but ultimately an attorney should\nreview all contracts to be safe.\nAttorneys often get a bad rap, I suppose from people who have lousy or no legal counsel during\nunfortunate circumstances. However, if you are prepared and proactive with your legal strategy, you\nwill love your lawyer. Make sure that you protect the most important asset you have, your company,\nwith adequate legal services from an attorney.\n11) The Business Plan Is Overrated\nNo business plan survives first contact with a customer.\n—Steve Blank, Silicon Valley–based retired serial entrepreneur\nAfter conjuring up a brilliant business idea, I would immediately start writing a business plan. Like a\nskilled magician, I could make a marvelous business plan appear before your eyes in just a few days.\nIt would be complete with colorful graphs, in-depth market research, and detailed financials. The\nplan would be ready to execute. And I was sure it had as many pages as possible. Why? I once heard\nan investor say that he only considers investing in companies with plans that make a thump when you\ndrop them on a table. After years of practical business experience, I realized that I didn’t make a good\nmagician and I was only fooling myself. Now I know better.\nExperience has taught me that when I get a new business idea, working on the business plan is\none of the last things to do. The three crucial steps I follow before even thinking of writing a business\nplan will work for you, too. First, \nexamine the competitive landscape to see what companies are\nalready there.\n What do they do poorly? What can you do differently to create a competitive\nadvantage? Second, \ndiscuss the idea with potential customers\n, asking basic questions that determine\nhow much they would value your product or service, which is perhaps the most important preliminary\nstep to writing the business plan. Third, \ndevelop a sketch or basic prototype of the product.\n If it’s a\nservice, map out vital steps and describe customer experiences.\nBy the way, when you are finally ready to write the business plan, make sure that you find\nprofessional help in areas that aren’t your expertise. If you don’t understand how to project cash flow\nfor the next five years, don’t attempt it. Likewise, if you don’t know anything about marketing, which\nis likely the most important part of your plan, you shouldn’t be writing that section. A business plan\nshould be a collaboration, not a solo endeavor. As a well-respected serial entrepreneur once told me,\ninvestors are skeptical of any business plan written by one person.\nEven the academic world, known for resisting change, is reassessing the importance of the\nbusiness plan. Candida Brush, chair of the entrepreneurship division and director of the Arthur M.\nBlank Center for Entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, put it best in a\nrecent interview with \nEntrepreneur\n magazine:\nStudents come in here saying they want to write a business plan, but that’s the last thing they\nneed to do. The only way to get to a point where you have a truly entrepreneurial idea is to\nuse a creative approach. Observe. Reflect. Do mini experiments, as opposed to sitting in\nthe library reading case studies. . . . And for us, even that plan is about the process, not\ncreating a 50-page action plan. If you get married to a bad idea, a business plan means\nnothing.\nBabson students are encouraged to do three feasibility studies before moving forward with an\nidea or writing a business plan. The studies are similar to the steps I mentioned above. More\nuniversities and entrepreneurs should adopt this approach.\nIn short, too much emphasis is still placed on writing a business plan when you have an idea.\nThere is an epidemic of “Frankenplans,” business plans that are a sloppy amalgamation of various\nbusiness plans or templates; having the document itself seems more important than the quality of the\nactual plan. Instead of rushing to finish the document, make sure you take the crucial preliminary steps\nbefore you begin writing. If done thoroughly, these steps make your business plan stronger and greatly\nimprove your chances of success and funding.\n12) Require Criticism and Disagreement in Your Company\nHonest disagreement is often a good sign of progress.\n—Mahatma Gandhi, Indian nationalism leader, social activist\nMichael Jordan is the laughingstock of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Jordan—who\ndominated the NBA for years, won six championships with the Chicago Bulls, was crowned Most\nValuable Player of the league five times, and still continues to be one of the most recognized sports\nfigures in the world—is shooting air balls, as it were. As owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, he has been\nunable to translate his success on the court into success in the front office. During the 2011–2012\nNBA season, his Bobcats had the worst winning percentage in NBA history. They reached their nadir.\nAs their season ended in total shame, the players and owners prepared for a different game during the\noff-season: the blame game.\nWhile the heated debate continues about what’s needed to save this franchise from complete\ncollapse, most people already agree that the lack of Jordan’s leadership is a major problem. Charles\nBarkley, a former NBA player turned commentator, has chided his friend in public, implying that\nJordan is an aloof owner who lacks management ability and has no interest in running a winning team.\nMany of Jordan’s closest confidants agree that the Bobcats’ leadership must be changed. Furthermore,\nthey point to a culture of acquiescence that prevents the franchise from moving forward. In other\nwords, Jordan is surrounded by yes-men minions who are afraid to tell him what he needs to hear in\norder to improve the team. This defeating culture can shoot down a business as easily as a basketball\nfranchise.\nWhen my company was young I committed the mistake of creating a culture in which everyone\nagreed with me. I only accepted individuals on my team who thought like me or who took orders\nhappily. Also, in the same way that Jordan intimidates members of the Bobcats organization, I\napparently had the same effect. Like Jordan, I was the superstar with a history of success. No one was\nwilling to challenge me or my ideas to take the company to a higher level. I was somewhat aware of\nthis internal culture, but I didn’t think it was harmful. Moreover, I wasn’t mature or confident enough\nto actively seek out dissenting opinions. As a result, my company didn’t reach its full potential. A\nculture that encouraged frequent criticism and disagreement could have led to that kind of success.\nNow I actively seek people who will ruffle my feathers by criticizing my ideas. When possible,\nI make these critics a part of my team. Otherwise, I keep them close by for consultation. If I find\npeople who can really get under my skin and make me question my way of thinking, I am especially\nmotivated. I work harder because I want to prove them wrong—either by strengthening my case or by\nfinding a better way. If my ideas aren’t working, I often adopt their suggestions. Through this process,\nmy company is stronger.\nMy latest venture, a data analytics company, has benefited tremendously from a culture in which\nideas are challenged routinely. For instance, going against the yes-man faction at the company, we\nopted to use new Agile methods to create our product. Consequently, product development is faster\nand leaner.\nGoing from celebrated champion to ridiculed loser is not what Jordan had in mind when he\ndecided to assume ownership of the Charlotte Bobcats. However, he may be out of his league, and\nit’s largely his fault. He now understands, like so many other business leaders, that he must employ\npeople who tell him when he is headed in the wrong direction. Otherwise, his odds of turning around\nhis franchise are next to nil.\nTake a lesson from Michael Jordan’s ownership woes and my less exciting anecdotes. Surround\nyourself with honest people who tell you the good, the bad, and the ugly. If you don’t, you may\nbecome the laughingstock of your industry, too.\nSo much for the theme of the classic Gatorade commercial that featured Jordan: “I wanna be like\nMike!”\n13) Fire Your Worst Customers\nSuccessful organizations (and I include churches and political parties on the list) fire the 1 percent of their constituents that cause\n95 percent of the pain.\n—Seth Godin, entrepreneur, author\nWhen most entrepreneurs start their business, they take every customer they can get. This approach\nreminds me of my obsession with scoring in my elementary school basketball games. As an\nadolescent benchwarmer with almost no playing time, I would rush to shoot once I finally received\nthe opportunity to play. The more shots I took, the better my chances of scoring and declaring success.\nThe overall score and team strategy didn’t matter. I rarely scored, and I looked like a headless\nchicken as I took the most ridiculous and inelegant shots. I was so focused on getting and shooting the\nball that I once made a basket for the opposing team while on defense. Similarly, entrepreneurs often\ndo more damage to themselves and their team by making haphazard attempts to score every potential\ncustomer.\nEvery veteran entrepreneur has scored for the other team, so to speak. In other words, we have\nall had customers who take advantage of us, and we allow them to do so. In some cases, this situation\ncan be perfectly fine, but it is not ideal when your business loses money. Frequently, we only realize\nat the point of no return that the unfavorable situation in which we find ourselves could have been\navoided; we could have passed on the customer altogether.\nMaking the decision to pass on a customer is especially difficult for young or new entrepreneurs\nwho are hungry for business and revenues. However, choosing bad customers can cause a lot of\nfrustration, drain resources, damage your reputation, and eventually put you out of business.\nTo help you decide what customers are worth your time, consider four important signs which\nindicate that you should not take a client and gracefully move on from the relationship. These signs\napply especially to entrepreneurs who run a service-oriented or consulting business.\n1. \nBe skeptical of a client who seems not to know what is needed or who constantly makes\nchanges.\n For example, if you have a web or graphic design company, explain clearly your creative\nprocess and the time needed for the project. Quantify all expectations. Some designers, for instance,\nagree to do three prototypes. Afterward, the client must choose from those three prototypes. Avoid at\nall costs a situation in which you are designing or creating indefinitely, only to have the client make a\nchoice on the tenth iteration. Also, a client should be comfortable with your capabilities and what to\nexpect from you. Find out from new clients what attracted them to your work. Show your portfolio.\n2. \nBe careful if a client is not willing to pay an hourly rate or a piece rate of some kind.\nAgreeing to a fixed cost for your work is not bad per se. However, it’s not so great if you end up\ndoing more work than you anticipated. Many clients encourage you to lower your cost to lock in a\ngood rate. In a gesture of good faith, sometimes the client will pay you all the money up front. That\nway, you are beholden to the client until it receives a deliverable it likes. These types of\narrangements can be especially stressful and strain a relationship to the point of litigation.\n3. \nAvoid any client who hesitates to sign a well-written agreement.\n This is a true test of\nwhether a client is worth your time and effort. An agreement or contract protects both parties and\noutlines expectations. Without a comprehensive agreement you have no way to protect your interests,\nassess the progress of the work you have done, and verify the deliverable.\n4. \nTake heed of any less than good feelings you have about a potential client.\n I have learned to\naccept my business intuition, and I would say that 80 percent of the time it leads me to make better\ndecisions about a potential client’s value.\nI recently received a request for my company’s services from a former client who cost me a lot\nmore money than I made. In fact, the experience of working with the company was terrible. As a\nresult, I respectfully rejected the overture and recommended another company. I learned the hard way\nthe first time and decided that I would do all I could to avoid the agony next time. Don’t be afraid to\nfire a client. Just because some customers want you doesn’t mean you need them.\n14) Make Money While Doing Nothing\n$1,000,000 in the bank isn’t the fantasy. The fantasy is the lifestyle of complete freedom it supposedly allows.\n—Timothy Ferriss, author, \nThe 4-Hour Workweek\nIn the 1200s, the Third Council of the Lateran, a group of Christian bishops, declared that anyone who\ncharged and accepted interest on a loan would be denied sacraments and Christian burial. Usury was\neventually determined a heresy and outlawed, relegating the practice to Jews, whose holy law, the\nTorah, allowed them to loan to non-Jews. Christian leaders and their followers strongly believed that\ncharging interest on a loan was an abomination to God. Their reasoning was based on the Holy Bible\nand the interpretation of relevant passages by contemporary scholars. Many reasons were given, but\none is especially noteworthy: They believed that labor without the expenditure of energy was a sin.\nTimes have certainly changed, but disdain for those who gain wealth from inheriting money,\ncharging interest, or making effortless deals still manifests itself—whether through Occupy Wall\nStreet protests or petty gossip. The average person, especially one who labors physically, abhors the\nidea of people amassing wealth by doing nothing. It goes against the good ol’ Protestant work ethic on\nwhich the United States was built. The idea, often fueled by intense jealousy, makes many people\nquite uncomfortable.\nI never thought I would be on the receiving end of such aversion and jealousy. Recently, during\nthe planning of an extended family vacation, a disgruntled family member commented, “I can’t go on\nvacation that long! Everybody can’t be like Kevin.” When I heard this, I was shocked. Apparently,\nbecause my income doesn’t depend on me working in the traditional sense, I was the object of\nridicule. I kept quiet. Dealing with such things is a small price to pay. It’s certainly not as bad as\nactually having to work for income or being denied a proper burial.\nThe reactions of people throughout history and in my own experience are understandable.\nEntrepreneurs who have figured out how to make money while doing nothing have reached the upper\nechelon of entrepreneurship. These overachievers have mastered the strategies that allow them to\nreach this level, which is where all of us want to be, and it is a major accomplishment. Having a\nprofitable business that can run well without you is true freedom.\nBut what is meant by “doing nothing”? In my opinion, the term isn’t so absolute. For simplicity,\nI’ll use the term popularized by a best-selling book of the same name. If your business can run while\nyou enjoy \nThe 4-Hour Workweek\n or less, then you fall into the doing-nothing category. By the way,\nthe work that goes into setting up a business that runs without its founder is often overlooked. “Doing\nnothing” disregards the work the entrepreneur put in beforehand. For example, it took me years of\ntrial and error and diligent work to master the concepts needed to be free.\nSo what strategies can carry you to this high level of entrepreneurship? In a nutshell, the\nstrategies—already covered in this book—are \nremoving yourself from your business, building\nsystems that are not people-dependent, automating activities using technology,\n and \noutsourcing to\nthe right partners.\n These suggestions certainly aren’t comprehensive, and you don’t have to employ\nall of them in any order, but they provide a general idea of the type of thinking that will get you to\nindependence. I expand on these concepts in other parts of this book.\nDrawing profits from one business while starting the next is a great feeling. That’s the life of an\nentrepreneur’s entrepreneur. In fact, as I write this, PayPal sent me a Notification of Payment\nReceived for one of my businesses. How apropos!\nI failed to mention something earlier. I have a very different definition of working. Instead of\nbeing stuck in an office, I would much prefer that my workday be like a recent excursion with a client.\nWe went on a safari in Nairobi, Kenya, and walked the beach with camels in Mombasa, Kenya.\nDuring the trip, I was able to check my financial dashboards every now and then on my mobile.\nThat’s my idea of work.\n15) Outsourcing Makes Sense\nIf you deprive yourself of outsourcing and your competitors do not, you’re putting yourself out of business.\n—Lee Kaun Yew, former prime minister, Singapore\nIn at least two episodes of \nShark\n \nTank\n, the popular ABC show in which entrepreneurs get a chance to\npitch their business idea to and receive funding from investors, some stubborn business owners\nrefused to manufacture their products where costs were lowest for the desired quality. Each\nentrepreneur had a solid business with customers and significant revenues, but neither company was\nprofitable, largely because production costs were so high. The sharks, who immediately realized the\nproblem, suggested that the entrepreneurs produce their goods in China, where costs would be much\ncheaper and thus profits much higher. However, both owners were adamant about continuing to\nmanufacture in the United States and creating jobs at home, an admirable but naïve decision that\nwould likely shut them down altogether. Ironically, while trying to create more jobs in the country\nthey love, they would likely add to the high unemployment rate. The investors, who were originally\nexcited about the businesses, ultimately lost interest because of the owners’ reluctance to outsource.\nThe episodes were quite emotional. In fact, one of the owners was on the verge of tears because\nhe so strongly believed in what he was doing for his country. His conviction prevented him from\ntaking the sharks’ advice. In a final attempt to make a deal, a shark tried to get one of the owners to\nunderstand that he could have more of an impact on his community plagued by high unemployment if\nhis business were successful. The shark’s efforts were futile. Though rattled, the owner stood pat,\nrealizing that he could be making the biggest mistake of his life. As a frustrated television viewer and\nbusiness owner, I certainly thought he was.\nSince our economy has taken a turn for the worse, “outsourcing” has become a dirty word,\ntantamount to “traitor” or “anti-American.” What true American wouldn’t want to create jobs here at\nhome, right? The United States, where outsourcing was once a popular trend and great for business,\nsuddenly threw globalism by the wayside and adopted an ideology of isolationism. Television\nsitcoms like \nOutsourced\n, in which an American corporation outsources its call center to India, don’t\nhelp the matter. In an uncommon display of political harmony, the Republican and Democratic Parties\nagree that keeping jobs in America is a top priority to grow our economy and to get it back to more\nprosperous times. However, ignoring politics and using common sense, the campaign against\noutsourcing does more harm than good when it comes to economic development.\nQuite simply, the benefits of outsourcing outweigh any negatives as its opponents describe them.\nBesides, you must do what’s best for your business. Whether you’re sending work to a contractor in\nSingapore or a vendor in South Carolina, outsourcing is good for business. Any functionality that is\nnot core to your business should be outsourced at the best cost and quality. In the majority of cases,\ntrying on your own to produce everything that your business needs is unrealistic and highly inefficient.\nIf you have believed the negative hype about outsourcing, quickly disabuse yourself of it and\nimplement the process into your business strategy. If you’re subscribing to the propaganda and\nrefusing to even consider outsourcing, your competitors are meanwhile outsourcing and working hard\nto put you out of business. You don’t need to be a high-profile shark to understand this reality.\n16) Move On Fast from a Bad Business Idea\nNothing is more dangerous than an idea when it is the only one you have.\n—Emile Chartier, French philosopher, journalist\n“My company is headed for sure failure, and I think the best thing to do is to shut it down before\nthings get worse.” How many times have you heard such a candid assessment of a business by its\nfounder? If you are like me, it’s probably not often. During my twelve years of being in business and\nin associated professional circles, I can count on one hand the number of times an entrepreneur has\ntold me that a company is doing poorly or is destined to crash and burn.\nWhy is that? Entrepreneurs are naturally tenacious, and expectedly so. They never give up; they\nstick with an idea until the death. We have all heard a miracle story or two that involves a founder\nwho overcame great odds. Pandora, a company that Tim Westergren founded and that took ten years\nto turn a profit, comes to mind. It’s quite an inspiring story of patience and persistence, but far from\nthe norm.\nRarely is the negative side of entrepreneurial tenacity discussed, but I have witnessed so many\nentrepreneurs hold on to a bad idea far too long. They refuse to acknowledge that things are going\nsouth or have no promise, and they go down with the sinking ship. For instance, a good friend of mine\nfinally threw in the towel on his men’s marriage magazine. He stuck with it for almost an entire\ndecade. I commend his determination, but I am happy he has moved on. It was like he kept trying to\nmake a bad marriage work (pun intended). A smart guy, he would have been better off devoting his\ntime to other ideas.\nThis problem is common among novice entrepreneurs. They tend to think that the idea they have\nis the only good one they’ve got, demanding an all-or-nothing response with no retreat possible.\nHowever, serial entrepreneurs and those who have built massive amounts of wealth in business rarely\nmake this mistake. Through their experience, they have learned how to determine whether to stay with\nan idea and for how long. Their previous success enables them to admit their failures freely and move\non to the next opportunity.\nRegardless of your business experience, you want to avoid the untamed-tenacity syndrome.\nUnfortunately, no definitive list of signs lets you know if you should abandon your idea. One reason is\nthat signs can be specific to an industry.\nFor example, I would have told my friend with the magazine to listen closely to Marc\nAndreessen, cofounder of Netscape and venture capitalist, in a recent television interview. I\nparaphrase: “Publications should cut their losses by shutting down their presses and moving to the\ndigital realm. Print is dead. Advertising dollars in print are drying up for that medium. Therefore,\nnow is not the ideal time to start a print publication.” Your circumstance may be different. Perhaps\nyour breakeven point is too far down the road based on industry metrics, or your market is too small\nto be profitable. As alluded to in the magazine scenario, you must find the oracles and special metrics\nin your industry to make sure you are on track.\nReiterating Chartier’s statement at the beginning of this section, an entrepreneur with a single\nidea can be catastrophic. Don’t let a bad idea derail your plans for greatness. If it isn’t working,\nmove on or adjust quickly.\n17) A Bad Economy Is a Great Opportunity\nA pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.\n—Winston Churchill, prime minister, United Kingdom\n(1940–45, 1951–55)\nTimes were good. No, they were great. My company had just passed six figures in revenue, and it\nwas headed to break the seven-figure mark. My team grew to almost twenty people, all of whom were\npassionate about the business and exceeded my expectations. Various local and national publications\nwere calling me to secure an interview so that they could highlight me, a young entrepreneur with\ngreat potential. I even received a call from a financial representative with Northwestern Mutual who\nsaw me featured in a magazine and thought I would be a great client. We met, and he handed me a\nthree-ring leather binder with a detailed plan that would enable me to retire comfortably by age forty.\nI was barely in my twenties.\nFast-forward a few years to now. The glory days are long gone. As President Barack Obama\nputs it, we continue to face the worst economic times since the Great Depression. Since 2008, my\ncompany revenues have dropped. Sometimes it feels like the challenging financial times of our start-\nup days. The team no longer consists of twenty people, and some of our best and brightest have\nmoved on to other ventures. If I appear in any publication or on television, it’s rarely to showcase my\nsuccess. Instead, it’s more likely to give advice on how to stay afloat during this economic\nmaelstrom. My financial plan needs adjustment. Retiring by age forty is not going to happen. Despite\nthe gloom, I know that the glory days will be back soon. History and experience tell me so.\nMany of the biggest companies in history—and smaller ones, too—thrived during a bad\neconomy. For example, Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, was started during a\nrecession in 1975. During that time, unemployment was high and gas prices were through the roof due\nto OPEC’s decision to increase prices drastically. A few other companies founded during difficult\neconomic times are Disney, IBM, and General Motors. Similarly, many companies already in\nexistence have made comebacks during challenging financial periods. Perhaps the most familiar and\nrecent example is Apple, which began its resurgence in 2001 during the dotcom bust and the effects of\nthe September 11, 2001, tragedy.\nAs I reflect on companies that weathered the storm, I remember that I started my company in\n2000 during the time of the dotcom bust and brief recession. In fact, I vividly remember major news\nmedia reporting on the huge number of unemployed college graduates. The signs of an impending,\nsevere recession were multiplying, especially after the 9/11 attacks. Despite the bad signs, I was\nfortunate that my youth and temerity enabled me to see the world through a positive lens. I knew that\nhard work would pay off, no matter what the circumstances. It certainly did.\nIn short, entrepreneurs do not allow a bad economy to hold them back from accomplishing their\ngoals. Ironically, poor economic conditions often have the opposite effect; they motivate\nentrepreneurs more and propel them to success even faster. Times are not so great as I write, but\nentrepreneurs ignore the zeitgeist and create positive circumstances. They roll up their sleeves and\nget to work, anticipating the next growth period. That’s where you want to be: ready to grab the bull\nby its horns and ride.\n18) Adopt Technology Early\nAny new technology tends to go through a 25-year adoption cycle.\n—Marc Andreessen, cofounder, Netscape; venture capitalist\nGrowing up in Boston around some of the sharpest and creative minds, I was quite fortunate.\nAdvanced computer technology was woven into the fabric of everyday life. In a way, being a nerd\nwas cool, I guess because there were so many of us.\nMy adolescent best friend, who eventually attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and I\nbuilt an interactive website on an intranet for a class presentation in tenth grade back in 1994. While\nwe were in high school, his father was a research scientist for the Bates Linear Accelerator Center\n(nuclear physics) for MIT, so the computer science labs on MIT’s campus were sometimes our\nstomping grounds. I remember the halcyon days of hacking on purple-accented, Sun Microsystems\nUltra workstations while leaning back in our swivel chairs that had ATHENA painted in big white\nletters on the back.\nLikewise, I was exposed in my youth to projects that the average person can only dream about or\nread about in science fiction novels. For example, we would visit places like MITRE Corporation, an\norganization that did extensive research for the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation\nAdministration. The company also conducted research to explore new technologies. As an\nadolescent, I vividly remember speaking to a scientist who developed the \nreal\n version of the toy\nNintendo Power Glove. He mentioned that the project cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. We also\nsaw other innovations with lasers and biometrics that are just reaching the commercial market today.\nI mention all of this because my background gives me tremendous perspective on how\ninnovations eventually reach the commercial market. Most of us who are members of the digerati\nknow that the Internet is not new, for instance. In fact, it was around in its primitive forms as early as\n1958. My first encounter with the Internet was through Prodigy in 1990, when I religiously wrote my\npen pal, Rachel, in San Francisco via electronic mail. Remember that Velcro was adopted by NASA\nin the late 1950s for space travel and eventually found widespread practical use here on earth.\nTechnological innovation takes, in many cases, decades to reach the consumer market. Nowadays,\nthat process is often condensed to just a few years.\nResearching the backgrounds of many of the most successful tech entrepreneurs reveals a\ncommon thread. Like me, they were exposed to new and exclusive technologies at an early point,\nallowing them to master these technologies and adopt them for eventual commercial use. For\nexample, cofounder of Apple Steve Jobs infiltrated Xerox’s PARC and “borrowed” the graphical\nuser interface. Similarly, Reed Hastings, founder of Netflix, was exposed to early DVD technology\nthat would inspire his business idea, and so on. The media glorification of so many successful tech\nentrepreneurs would lead you to believe that their achievements are the result of pure genius.\nHowever, we know better. These entrepreneurs were often exposed early to technologies that gave\ncontext to and inspired their genius.\nWhat does all of this mean for you? Not only are entrepreneurs early adopters, but they also\nexplore technologies way before they are even introduced to the general public for consumption.\nThus, find every opportunity to learn about what technology is the next big thing. This practice pays\ntremendous dividends.\n19) Ignorance Can Be Bliss\nTo succeed in life, you need two things: ignorance and confidence.\n—Mark Twain, author, humorist\nPete Kight has a success story that is simply amazing. The company he founded, CheckFree, was\nacquired in 2007 by Fiserve for approximately $4.4 billion in cash. In many ways, his story sounds\nlike other millionaire success stories that include dropping out of school, being ridiculed for pursuing\na big idea, receiving rejection after rejection from prospective customers, having little money, and so\non. But one aspect of his story is truly inspiring, and it serves as a profound lesson in\nentrepreneurship.\nI was fortunate to hear Pete relate his fascinating accomplishments in person and in his own\nwords just a few months before his company was acquired. He began telling his story before a crowd\nof students, entrepreneurs, and dignitaries: “I didn’t do well in school. In fact, I dedicated most of my\ntime and energy to sports. I was a decathlete. After getting injured and becoming frustrated with\ncollege, I dropped out. . . .” His delivery was unimpressive, marked by monotony and an awkward\ncadence, but everyone was still riveted. The nontraditional path he took to success held everyone’s\nattention. He didn’t need the swagger or panache of a Donald Trump or the enlightenment of a Warren\nBuffett.\nPete finished his story, talking about how he became a manager of health clubs and began\nexploring the idea of deducting monthly health-club payments from checking accounts. He was\nfrustrated with a payment system that required high-pressure sales and a lot of manual work to collect\npayments. Convinced by his vision to change the financial industry, Pete eventually hired a computer\nprogrammer and operated his new electronic bill payment business out of his grandmother’s basement\nin Ohio.\nThe most compelling part of Pete’s speech was his admission that he knew nothing about\ncomputer software. In fact, he emphasized this fact. He commented that he didn’t believe he would be\nas successful as he was in business if he knew how to program computers. Put another way, his\nignorance about computers enabled him to focus on the more important aspects of growing his\nbusiness. What a profound insight, considering that many of the millionaire or billionaire stories we\nhear come from individuals whose success largely depended on their technical talents and knowledge\nof their particular industry.\nWhat do a majority of the top-twenty richest Americans have in common? They worked in the\nindustry that they would eventually dominate. Bill Gates was a computer programmer; Warren Buffett\nwas a trader; Larry Ellison studied computer design; George Soros was a trader; Jeff Bezos studied\ncomputer science; Mark Zuckerberg studied computer science as well. I could keep going down the\nForbes\n 400 list, but some wealthy individuals have indeed broken the mold and challenged the\nassumption that you have to be highly familiar with the industry in which you plan to compete. Pete\nKight is one of them. He came from neither a financial services background nor a computer\nprogramming background. As one investor who turned him down said, he was “a broken-down ex-\njock.” His achievements are that much more impressive.\nWhat is my point? The data indicate that in order to be a wealthy individual or successful\nentrepreneur, you should probably be an expert in or knowledgeable of the industry you strive to\ndominate, although there are exceptions to that rule. Look at individuals like Pete Kight, founder of\nCheckFree; Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx; and Kevin Plank, founder of Under Armour. Conceiving\nof an idea that puts you outside of your area of expertise or comfort zone does not equal failure.\nPerhaps your outside perspective enables you to see things in a fresh way, seizing dormant\nopportunities. As Pete Kight proves, your ignorance could actually be your biggest advantage and\naccount for your ultimate success.\n20) Adapt to Change Quickly\nChange before you have to.\n—Jack Welch, former CEO, General Electric\nThe average lifespan of a Fortune 500 company is getting shorter and shorter, largely because of the\nascendancy of disruptive technologies and companies. Small and nimble start-ups are often\noverlooked by big corporations and now have the ability with little resources to topple billion-dollar\ncompanies.\nSubstantive data show the increased attrition rate of big companies. An analysis of the major\nstock market indexes over the past few decades reveals that companies have shorter runs. For\nexample, only a fraction of the companies listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the 1980s\nremain on the list. What does this mean? Many things, but a closer look at the index’s rejects sheds\nlight on why companies were removed: Many of the companies vanished for failing to adapt to\nchanging times and evolving with customer demands. Thus, it’s safe to say that companies that do not\nembrace change and reinvent themselves are headed out of business fast.\nChange is inevitable, but it is not easy. One of my favorite speakers and authors, Don Hutson,\nsaid this about change: “Change happens when the pain to stay the same exceeds the pain to change.”\nAlthough Hutson was speaking to a group of individuals interested in improving themselves, the same\nprinciple applies to business. A business that doesn’t change or reinvent itself periodically will\nexperience the pain of bankruptcy. At that grim point, change is the only option.\nCompanies that have reached a degree of success are most likely to resist change and to stretch\ntheir pain threshold. If something is not broken, don’t try to fix it, right? Wrong. There are countless\nexamples of large companies that dominated the market for long periods, but now are struggling just\nto stay alive. A prime example is Sears Roebuck and Co., which dominated the retail market for\ndecades. Now it struggles to turn a profit. Sears rested on its laurels and missed opportunities to\nconquer the new business frontier in the 1990s: e-commerce. To Sears’s great misfortune,\ncompetitors like Amazon.com and Walmart aggressively pursued the retail market and are now\nwinning big.\nThe question then becomes: How do you manage and cope with change, especially as times and\ntechnology move so fast? Each of my companies has faced the challenge of staying relevant and\nkeeping up with the times. As a result, I have a healthy sense of paranoia. I now use a basic strategy\nthat minimizes the risk of my companies becoming complacent and unwilling to change. I conduct\neach company as if the way we do business is going to be obsolete in one to two years. To anticipate\nwhere the market is going and where we should invest, we do a bimonthly review and a report of all\nour systems and processes. The review allows us to identify and adapt to potential disruptions like\nnew technology and competition.\nFor example, division heads provide a review and a report of how we can improve our products\nand services even if they are selling well. We also scan the competitive landscape to find any\ninnovations that are threatening. In addition, we identify new technologies and resources that help us\nto stay ahead of the change curve. A recent company review, for instance, revealed how we can use\nPinterest, a social media platform that became popular in 2012, to target new segments in our\nmarketing campaigns that normally would be overlooked. We know from experience that the value of\nusing such platforms is greater if you use them early. Waiting puts you at a huge disadvantage. This\nreview and report process is one of the simplest ways to proactively seek change and to reinvent the\nway you do business, preventing you from becoming complacent and more vulnerable to\nobsolescence.\nA business that ignores change is a business that welcomes its own extermination. The products\nor services you offer today won’t keep you in business tomorrow. The very nature of business\nincludes changing to meet customers’ demands in a better way. If you have no strategy to proactively\ndeal with change in your business, save yourself from a slow death and just shut down shop now.\n21) Technology Is an Opportunity, Not a Threat\nTechnology has always been important, but we are standing on the precipice of an inflection point in human history. Technology is\nreaching what I call the knee of the curve, a point in time which its exponential growth is taking off at a nearly vertical slope. . . . The\npace of progress is itself accelerating.\n—Ray Kurzweil, author, \nThe Singularity Is Near\nThe most challenging thing to do in business is to stay in business. According to the U.S. Department\nof Commerce, “Seven out of 10 new employer firms survive at least 2 years, half at least 5 years, a\nthird at least 10 years, and a quarter stay in business 15 years or more.” Evidently, as time increases,\nthe odds of your company surviving decrease.\nTime seems to be the common dooming factor for thousands of businesses, but a much more\ndevastating agent is at work here, especially nowadays. That agent is technology. At a recent\ntechnology conference in Atlanta, Carlos Dominguez, senior vice president at Cisco, discussed how\nthings that used to take a long time now happen quickly and effortlessly. One of his examples\nshowcased the power of social media and its ability to spread information at unprecedented speeds.\nHe related a story of how he used Twitter to avoid an immediate travel disaster in Mexico. He ended\nthe series, declaring, “Times are exponential.” I couldn’t agree more. Technological innovation,\nwhether rapid progress in computer science or nanotechnology, is seemingly causing the condensation\nof time. It is also driving many people out of business.\nAs an entrepreneur, you must be well aware of technology’s power to alter your business. On the\none hand, ignoring technology can mean your quick demise. On the other hand, if you adopt it early, it\ncan catapult your business to tremendous growth. One way to stay on top of technological innovation\nis to implement strategies that promote and reward forward thinking in your company.\nIn his excellent book \nJump the Curve\n, futurist Jack Uldrich discusses strategies to survive what\nhe calls an “exponential economy,” an economy driven by technological innovation. With compelling\ncases and commonsense analogies, he urges readers to stay ahead of the curve, referring to the curve\non an exponential graph. One of his most convincing strategies is to think rationally about the\nimplications of future-generation technology. To illustrate his point, he uses the case of Reed\nHastings, founder of Netflix. Hastings, a former Peace Corps volunteer, realized after seeing DVD\ntechnology in 1996 that data storage would make huge advances. (It certainly did.) As a result,\nHastings founded Netflix in 1999 and has grown his company to become a billion-dollar behemoth.\nNetflix continues to be an industry leader in the video/home rental market. Uldrich would say that\nHastings was able to “jump the curve.”\nLikewise, I attribute my early entrepreneurial success to being able to see into the technological\nfuture and anticipating consumer demands that I could meet using new technologies. Realizing that\npublications and individuals had no simple tool to publish their content online, I created a web-based\ncontent management system called OmniPublisher. Users didn’t have to know HTML, CSS, PHP,\nJavaScript, or any other computer programming language to use the software. They only needed to be\ncomfortable with navigating a web browser in order to publish their own content online. As\nbandwidth capacity increased and Internet usage surged, OmniPublisher grew in popularity.\nIn 1977 Ken Olson, president and founder of Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC), proclaimed,\n“There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.” His comment denounced the latest\ntechnological developments and favored his company’s main product, business mainframe computers.\nMeanwhile—that same year, in fact—a burgeoning company called Apple was founded on the idea\nthat everyone would have a personal computer someday. We all know how this story ends. In\nDecember 1980 Apple went public, propelled by the incredible sales of the Apple I.\nThere are countless stories of people resisting technological innovations and getting it wrong.\nThese people claim that Facebook is spooky; Twitter is a waste of time; and Pinterest . . . what is\nthat? These skeptics are the progeny of Ken Olson. Sooner or later, they, too, will be out of business.\nDon’t let that happen to you.\n22) Always Follow Up\nSuccess comes from taking the initiative and following up.\n—Anthony Robbins, author, professional speaker\nA few months ago I had lunch with a good friend and mentor who is a member of one of the largest\nand most successful angel investor organizations in the United States. We meet from time to time to\nshare stories, ideas, and opportunities.\nOur lunch took place shortly after one of his organization’s meetings, in which two entrepreneurs\ngave a brief presentation about their business and asked for investment capital. Members of the angel\norganization then discussed whether to advance the companies to the due-diligence phase required\nbefore committing any money. One company, a green company, had a compelling value proposition\nthat I thought was worth funding.\nI have been to several of these meetings, and no matter how many I attend, the experience never\ngrows old or loses excitement. This is the big leagues, where big companies are made. Entrepreneurs\nwho have reached this point have worked hard and fought for the opportunity to present before the\nangels. Despite receiving thousands of applications, the angels accept only a few companies to\npresent before the body. For this reason, I was shocked to hear what my friend shared with me about\none particular company that totally blew the opportunity.\nA company that impressed the angels with a top-notch presentation and innovative product\nbasically disappeared during the due-diligence process. The head of the committee assigned to carry\nout the due diligence never heard back from the company’s CEO during the final stages of the\nprocess. The angels felt jaded. Their chairman even made several personal calls to the CEO, but he\nwas nowhere to be found. Ironically, there were no hiccups during the due-diligence process. The\ncompany’s request for funds was pretty much guaranteed. After several attempts to find the missing\nCEO, the angels gave up. At this point, they weren’t so sure about investing in a person who doesn’t\nhave the decency to follow up anyway.\nApparently, the foibles that I thought were limited to novice business owners or CEOs of young\nstart-ups were also common among more established companies. I couldn’t believe it. In the back of\nmy mind, I was thinking, \nGive me a million dollars for my company, and I will pick up the phone so\nfast you will wonder if the phone even rang!\n I don’t know why the CEO disappeared, but there is no\nreason to leave such influential people—or anybody for that matter—hanging that way. Regardless of\nthe circumstances, he should have let the angel group know. At the very least, it’s common courtesy.\nThis classic case of an entrepreneur failing to follow up is a simple mistake that can have\ndevastating consequences. It’s a simple fact: Those who master the art of following up are more\nsuccessful than those who do not, yet so many entrepreneurs overlook and underestimate this simple\nrule. Why?\n1. \nFear of rejection causes many entrepreneurs to fail to follow up.\n Learning how to deal with\nrejection years ago was especially difficult for me, as a young and somewhat antisocial computer\nprogrammer. Having to sell my ideas to others was frightening—and quite frankly it still is\nsometimes. The only rejection I knew when I started my company was a compiler telling me that my\nprogram wouldn’t run. (Don’t worry if you didn’t understand the last sentence. It’s just computer\ntalk.) No one likes being rejected, but you must get over this fear. I often interpret a no as meaning\n“not right now.” I have learned more about my products and services from people telling me no than\nfrom people telling me yes. When you follow up with people, especially during a sales call or a\nnegotiation, do it with complete confidence. If you receive a no, ask open-ended questions to learn\nwhy the situation didn’t turn out the way you wanted. For example, if someone doesn’t want to buy\nyour product, ask, “What was the determining factor in your decision?” Turn a negative into a\npositive.\n2. \nEntrepreneurs lack the dedication and energy to follow up.\n Following up takes concerted\neffort and planning. I never thought something could be so exhaustive. Sometimes several calls to an\nindividual are needed to get a desired result. However, it’s worth it. An automotive company took\nabout fifty inquiries over the course of a year before I finally made it a client, and now it’s one of my\nbiggest. Committed to a successful outcome, I put on my calendar to follow up with my contact every\nweek or when I found information or news that could relate to her position at the company. A\ncustomer relationship management tool to assist you in following up regularly with people who can\nhelp you simplifies the task.\n3. \nA misunderstanding of business etiquette prevents many entrepreneurs from following up.\nThe entrepreneur who commits this error is self-absorbed, following up but doing a lousy job at it.\nAn entrepreneur might assume that the contact should always take the next step. Meanwhile, budget\nplanning periods pass, investment priorities change, contacts leave the company, and so on. On the\ncontrary, the entrepreneur who calls back several times, ignoring the “volley protocol,” more often\ngets the prize. Sometimes people simply forget or want you to do all the work, but that’s sometimes a\nsmall price to pay for a big payoff.\nIn brief, don’t let these three common reasons for failing to follow up cripple you. Entrepreneurs\ndon’t miss opportunities; they seize them. The surest way to do this is to follow up with everybody,\nespecially people who can help your business excel. As for the elusive entrepreneur who sought\nfunding from angel investors, his company has not made much progress. No surprise there.\n23) Have Laserlike Focus\nYou must remain focused on your journey to greatness.\n—Les Brown, motivational speaker, author\nJust a few weeks after being hired, Adam, my vice president of marketing and sales, popped his head\ninto my office through a cracked door and said, “I think we have a problem.” After I invited him in, he\ncontinued with an easygoing tone that belied the seriousness of his warning, saying, “I think we sell\ntoo many things. I find that sales are suffering because we confuse prospects with so many options,\nand therefore people are less likely to buy.” I didn’t respond for a few seconds, as I let the veracity of\nhis observations sink in. He was right. My company needed to change; we needed to focus on what\nwe did best instead of trying to be all things to all people.\nThat day, my company was on the verge of celebrating its ten-year anniversary. The company\nhad come a long way since its founding on a small college campus. In the beginning days of the\ncompany, the focus was on building top-notch web applications and offering great value. However,\nten years later we had grown to include numerous products and services under the umbrella of a\nholding company. Consequently, we developed a we-do-it-all mentality and pitch. Our marketing\nmaterials, which included pages of options and beautiful examples of our work, were expansive.\nWhen it came to media and marketing, if you needed it, we sold it.\nSomehow over the ten years of existence, my company lost focus and with it the potential for\ntrue greatness. We subscribed to the common idea that expanding our line of products and services\nwas a sure path to more success. It wasn’t. As a result, the company wallowed in mediocrity, trying\nto chase every market possible. Specifically, the quality of our products and services declined,\nemployee morale suffered, resources were wasted, sales leveled off, and confusion abounded. We\ncommoditized ourselves, and we were happy because that’s what we thought we were supposed to\ndo.\nThis idea not only debilitates small and medium-sized businesses, but also large multinational\ncompanies. For example, during the 1990s, Apple suffered from an expansive product line that almost\nled it to bankruptcy. You probably know the story. It took the return of Apple’s cofounder, Steve\nJobs, as CEO to turn the company around. How did he do it? Jobs eliminated nonessential product\nlines of the company, keeping only four. Some of his eliminations were profitable lines. Due in large\npart to its limited focus, Apple is now the most valuable company in the world. When discussing the\namazing turnaround in a 2008 interview, Jobs said,\nPeople think focus means saying “yes” to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not\nwhat it means at all. It means saying “no” to the hundred other good ideas that there are.\nYou have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things\nwe have done.\nLikewise, Pepsi-Cola stopped trying to be all things to all people in order to compete with its\nrival Coca-Cola. In their book, \nThe 21 Immutable Laws of Marketing\n, Al Ries and Jack Trout\ndiscuss Pepsi-Cola’s amazing growth during the 1980s when it changed its focus to reaching the\nteenage market. Consequently, Pepsi-Cola went from being outsold by Coca-Cola in the late 1950s by\nfive to one to being only 10 percent behind in total sales in the United States. Ries and Trout wrote,\n“There seems to be an almost religious belief that the wider net catches more customers, in spite of\nmany examples to the contrary.”\nWhen my vice president came into my office to tell me that we needed to cut some of our\nbusinesses, I quickly reflected on my various entrepreneurial endeavors. At that time I had started\nfifteen different businesses. All of them had made money at some point, but only a handful were\nprofitable. I realized that I needed to return to my start-up days when my focus was laserlike. That\nday I learned to say no, as Jobs would have recommended. I cut unnecessary businesses. Since then,\nmy company has enjoyed an invigorating rebirth and growth period that can only be attributed to our\nwillingness to say yes to saying no.\n24) Nonprofit Really Means Profit\nOpportunity often comes disguised.\n—Napoleon Hill, author, \nThink and Grow Rich\nWhen I started my company, I had this ill-conceived notion about nonprofit organizations: I falsely\nbelieved that nonprofits weren’t worth pursuing as clients. I assumed that they would be terrible\ncustomers. After all, they didn’t make any profit, right? How could they afford what I had to offer? I\nwas so naïve and dead wrong. Nonprofit organizations were a huge contributor to my early success\nand continue to be a significant part of my company’s revenue.\nI learned that for-profit companies and nonprofit organizations have more similarities than\ndifferences. For example, nonprofits have the same major challenge that corporations have:\ngenerating revenue. In fact, many CEOs and directors of nonprofit organizations lead with a profit\nmind-set. Furthermore, like corporations, nonprofits devote a large portion of their budgets to\npurchasing products and services to help generate revenue. This fact translates into opportunity for\nentrepreneurs to meet that demand. Consequently, nonprofits are likely a viable market for your\nbusiness.\nThere are differences, too, between the two entities. Most people focus on the fact that\nnonprofits use surplus revenues to achieve its goals rather than to distribute them as profit or\ndividends. In other words, nonprofits \ncan\n have more revenues than expenses in a given fiscal year,\nbut they must use what would be considered profit to fund more programs or to establish an\nendowment, and so on. Some people classify this difference as a small one, considering that you\ncould interpret a nonprofit organization as a corporation that is reinvesting its surplus back into the\nbusiness. Nevertheless, the takeaway is that nonprofits certainly have money to spend, just like\ncorporations.\nHere are three reasons you should be doing business with nonprofits and perhaps even making\nthem a priority.\n1. \nNonprofits do spend money.\n A large part of nonprofits’ budgets are dedicated to operations,\nwhich can include things like utilities, rent, software, training, and travel. They also spend a lot on\nsales and marketing to find donors or to support ancillary sources of income. According to the Forbes\nlist of the 200 largest U.S. charities in 2011, the rankings and annual expenses of five popular\ncharities are as follows:\n1. The Mayo Clinic, $5.1 billion\n2. YMCAs in the United States, $4.5 billion\n3. United Way, $3.8 billion\n15. Boys and Girls Clubs, $1.1 billion\n20. Habitat for Humanity International, $781 million.\nBy the way, many nonprofits are required to spend money they received through grants that have\nvery specific guidelines. Certain grants require nonprofits to spend money before a deadline. Thus, an\norganization may be looking to spend money quickly to remain in compliance with the stipulations of\na grant received from a private donor or a government entity.\nOne of my first major clients was a nonprofit organization in education. My company was able\nto negotiate an amazing deal in which we received a database of the organization’s corporate\ncontacts. It was a list of over one hundred Fortune 500 companies and buyer contact information. In\naddition to this, the nonprofit organization hired us annually to develop new marketing materials. We\nalso wrote and implemented its social media strategy. This major account lasted nearly a decade, and\nthough we no longer have this client, we still use and benefit from the database of Fortune 500\ncompanies we received.\n2. \nNonprofits are willing to take risks with new vendors to save money or to generate solid\nrevenues.\n If your product helps nonprofits save money or generate significant income, you are well on\nyour way to gaining great customers. Nonprofits are under constant pressure to watch their spending\nand keep expenses in check. A quality product or service that aids them in this area is like pure gold.\nShortly after the completion of OmniPublisher, my company’s online content management\nsystem, we decided to use local nonprofit organizations as our beta testers. We eventually brought\nmany of them on as paying clients and in the process received great feedback on how we could\nimprove our product. Consequently, our first marketing campaign for the software targeted state and\nnational trade organizations that served thousands of nonprofits. The strategy worked well, as many\nnonprofits loved the product, but more importantly loved the price.\n3. \nNonprofits are loyal and will refer you if you are excellent.\n In many large cities, you’ll find\nthat nonprofits tend to be located in a certain part of the city. Maybe a designated building offers\nsubsidized rent, or that’s just where the nonprofit community has thrived. It is a great indication of\nhow close-knit the industry is. Accordingly, executives and employees of different organizations often\nshare resources. They are especially willing to recommend good resources to for-profit enterprises,\ntoo.\nOver the years, my nonprofit clients have been especially loyal. They will refer me to other\nnonprofits and give the most favorable references. I think a common sentiment exists among these\norganizations that the relationships they build with vendors are special. It’s not business as usual in a\ncorporate way. Their vendors help them to save lives, build homes, provide education, and so on.\nNonprofit organizations often feel a special affinity for those vendors that help them change the\nworld, and they tend to be especially supportive of their vendors. I have personally witnessed the\nbenefits of this exceeding goodwill, which has helped my company prosper.\nIf you think that serving the nonprofit sector is a waste of time, just ask Facebook. The social\nmedia giant has profited greatly from its popular Causes application. Causes serves hundreds of\nthousands of nonprofit organizations every day, making Facebook millions of dollars in processing\nfees and from customizing fundraising campaigns. Not only Facebook, but also many other companies\nconsider the nonprofit sector to be an important business segment. Hence, from the very beginning,\nsee how your product or service can serve nonprofits. Chances are that you will realize that nonprofit\nreally means profit—at least for you.\n25) Explore New Adventures for Inspiration\nExploration is really the essence of the human spirit.\n—Frank Borman, retired NASA astronaut\nThe other day while checking out new books at Barnes and Noble, I came across the story of how a\nyoung Howard Schultz, the current CEO of Starbucks, was inspired by a trip he took to Italy that\nwould change his life completely and change the restaurant business.\nIn 1981 Schultz was a twenty-eight-year-old director of marketing for Starbucks and in Milan,\nItaly, on a buying trip. He noticed that not only did the ubiquitous coffee shops there make great\nespresso, but they also served as local meeting places. These shops were the hubs of the community.\nSchultz’s Italian excursion and the rich experiences he had at those small coffee shops would serve as\nthe model for his aggressive overhaul and growth strategy. We all know the amazing end to this story.\nStarbucks is now the largest coffeehouse company in the world, with over 19,500 stores in over fifty\ncountries.\nThis story is just one that proves the benefits of getting outside of your comfort zone, but for\nmany people this is easier said than done. Too often, entrepreneurs operate solely within the confines\nof their industries. They socialize with the same type of people, go to the same kinds of places, eat the\nsame foods, visit the same websites, read the same books, and speak the same lingo. Or it could be\nthat entrepreneurs are focused on their businesses so much that they don’t take time to do something\ntotally unrelated to what they usually do. Immerse yourself in your industry and focus on it, but step\naway once in a while, too. If you don’t, you could be missing out on a monumental, inspirational\nmoment that takes your business to global heights.\nWhenever you have the chance to travel, do so. International travel is great, but inspiration can\nalso come from a day trip to another city in your own state or country. Seeing how people do things in\na different environment sparks creativity. For example, when visiting Peachtree City here in Georgia,\nI was amazed to find that the city is designed for residents to drive golf carts everywhere. There is\nnot much need for a car. Small bridges going over main streets and customized paths were built for\ngolf carts. I even saw a mother with her baby hitched to the golf cart in the backseat. I am not sure\nwhat business could come from that but I was at least inspired to move there. I thought it was pretty\ncool.\nStepping outside of your immediate box, whether it’s your office or home, also helps to foster\ninspiration. If I am stumped or experience some sort of a mental block, I step outside my office to take\na walk or do an activity that engages another part of my brain or body. A college professor suggested\nthis technique years ago when I was a computer science major. I didn’t believe that it worked until I\ntried it. Whenever I reached a mental block while programming, I would take a break and change my\nsurroundings. Almost magically, a solution to my problem would come to me. As a result, I now use\nthis basic technique frequently to overcome any type of creative breakdown or obstacle.\nWhile the focus has been on changing your scenery for inspiration, exploring new activities is\njust as important and effective. I have expanded my leisure activities to things I normally would not\ndo, such as learning to speak Chinese, reading classic English literature, and listening to different\ntypes of music, like country and Hindi. Ideas for my business now come from the most extraneous\nexperiences. Without making a conscious effort to seek such new things, I doubt these inspirations\nwould have come.\nIt’s hard to believe that a chance trip to Italy brought us Starbucks as we know it today. There\nisn’t a major city on planet Earth that doesn’t have a Starbucks. Had Schultz not made that famous\ntrip, who knows where millions of people would buy their coffee in the morning and meet to form a\nstart-up? The evidence is in the coffee, so to speak.\nPlacing yourself in new environments and exploring new things enables you to apply those\nexperiences to other facets of life. You become a synthesizer, a skill that, honed properly, could be\nthe key to your next big opportunity in business.\n26) Failure Doesn’t Kill You; It Makes You Stronger\nFailure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.\n—Henry Ford, founder, Ford Motor Company\nI had the recent privilege of participating in a national business-pitch contest. I entered on a whim,\nthinking that it would be fun and challenging to put myself in a high-pressure sales situation and see if\nI could take the top spot. The prize, which was $10,000, would not be so bad either. To my surprise, I\nwas chosen from over one hundred entries across the country to compete against nine other\nsemifinalists in Chicago.\nWhile almost all finalists gave their sixty-second pitch without a hiccup, one finalist completely\nfell apart under the pressure. It was an utter disaster. Every time he tried to restart his pitch as the big\nclock counted down the seconds, he would fumble yet again. With each successive attempt, his ability\nto recover was increasingly difficult. Despite an encouraging and applauding audience of almost one\nthousand, he eventually gave up. He put his head down and headed off stage to ponder his\nembarrassing performance. He exited with almost fifteen seconds left on the clock, so the host gently\nescorted him back to the stage, front and center. The young man’s saving grace was the uplifting\nadvice that the three judges gave him after his time expired. He was able to leave the stage with a\nmodicum of self-respect, but you could tell that he was still in shock.\nWhile we were all backstage after the catastrophe, the other finalists and people standing around\ndidn’t approach him to offer their support. Instead, they watched him walk by with his head down. He\nwas on the verge of an emotional meltdown as he retreated to a private area backstage to think about\nwhat just happened. A few people tried to cheer him up, but their attempts seemed insincere at best.\nIronically, the finalists teemed with entrepreneurial confidence but lacked the confidence to show true\nempathy to a fallen comrade at a crucial moment.\nConsidering that the dejected finalist was left alone licking his wounds, I approached him to\ngive him a much-needed pep talk. He was about eight years younger than I was, and I sensed that he\nwasn’t very experienced with these types of events. I told him, “You will nail it next time. This is\nhard to swallow, but you’ll recover.” I also told him that of all the ideas that I heard in the contest, his\nwas quite promising. I continued, saying, “I would much rather have a terrible pitch from which I can\nrecover than a terrible idea that has no promise.” He seemed to agree, but I could tell that he was still\ndepressed for ruining what he considered to be a big opportunity. I could only hope to have made an\nimpact on the young man such that he would pick himself up and keep going. After all, that’s what\nentrepreneurship is all about.\nFailure is inevitable in entrepreneurship, but how you deal with failure determines whether you\nare ultimately a winner. In watching the huge failure of our colleague in this pitch contest, we all\nwere reminded of this reality—a lesson greater than any advice the three judges gave, a lesson more\nimportant than the perfect pitch of the winning finalist. Finally, it was a lesson more valuable than\nwinning the $10,000 prize.\n27) Seek Partnerships for the Right Reasons\nFor entrepreneurs looking to build a new business or expand an existing one, a strong partner can be key.\n—Barry Horwitz, president, Horwitz & Co.\nWe had hit a grand slam with one particular partnership. We could hardly contain our excitement.\nAfter six months of determining each company’s deliverables and getting legal departments to sign off\non the agreement, our partnership with a global company with billions of dollars in assets was on the\nverge of becoming reality. We could now accelerate our growth, using our partner’s many global\nchannels. We felt as if we hit the jackpot and were just waiting to receive our bags of money. Then\nthings suddenly grew complicated.\nAfter the company’s sales director signed off on the deal and encouraged us to post a press\nrelease on our website with a quotation that he provided, I received the following message in an e-\nmail: “This email is to confirm there is no national partnership agreement with our company and . . .\nthe press release you have currently posted on your national web site is wrong and misleading. Please\nremove it from your web site today.” I also received a threatening phone call from the senior vice\npresident of the company, asking me to call her immediately. When I called, she demanded that we\nremove our press release and disregard any agreements made by her colleagues; otherwise we would\nface their legal department.\nI knew we had a major problem, but whatever the problem was, it wasn’t with my company. We\nhad made sure to get permission in writing for everything we wanted to do. My best guess was that\nsomething had happened internally at the other company to cause the partnership to fall apart. Despite\nthe collapse of the deal, a part of me was happy that it occurred before we were too involved. After\nthe incident, we had no desire to work with the company. So, the result was no world denomination\nfor us or trips to the bank for our money bags—at least not with this shoddy partner.\nI later found out that the pernicious partner wasn’t really able to open doors that we thought it\ncould. The company had several affiliates that had tremendous power over headquarters. In other\nwords, because individual owners had the final say of working with my company, there was no value\nin partnering with the parent company. Even with the endorsement of the potential partner’s\nheadquarters, we would still have to convince affiliate owners of the value of working with us.\nMoreover, the partner’s endorsement would strain its relationships with unwilling owners. We didn’t\nanticipate this scenario, especially since the true relationship between the parent company and\naffiliates wasn’t clear. Regardless, our intentions and proceedings were transparent. If the partner had\noperated the same way, everything would have gone smoothly.\nIf put together properly, partnerships can significantly boost your business. The key to\nestablishing an effective partnership is best described by start-up guru Guy Kawasaki: “The gist of\ngood partnering is that it should accelerate cash flow, increase revenue, and reduce costs.\nPartnerships built on solid business principles like these have a much greater likelihood of\nsucceeding.”\nHowever, a partnership built improperly wastes your time and hurts your business. As Kawasaki\nsuggests, some reasons not to form a partnership include covering your weaknesses and generating\npress coverage. These are two sure ways to start off on the wrong foot, but several entrepreneurs\nbelieve that these are perfectly tenable reasons to pursue a partnership. Partnerships should be built\non strengths, not weaknesses. Each company’s goal should be to enhance something the other\ncompany does well. Furthermore, partnerships established to impress or placate the press inevitably\nbackfire. Sooner or later, the true intentions of the partnership surface, especially if it’s yielded no\ntangible results.\nIn short, partnerships should not be taken lightly or rushed, and they should be pursued for the\nright reasons. If you follow the suggested guidelines, you will be less likely to enter into a partnership\nthat does more harm than good. As for the botched partnership I mentioned earlier, we found another\npartner with a global presence. This relationship has worked out great, and revenues have increased\nover 700 percent.\n28) Be a Master at Leveraging Resources\nPeople with leverage have dominance over people with less leverage.\n—Robert T. Kiyosaki, author, \nRich Dad, Poor Dad\nWhen I started my media company, very few prospects wanted to buy advertisements. They saw the\ntremendous value in my media outlets, but always tried to leverage what they had instead of paying.\nFor example, I approached a Chinese restaurant near my college campus that offered me a semester’s\nworth of free food in exchange for advertisement. A few blocks down from the restaurant, there was a\nshoe store. The owner there promised to give me six pairs of new shoes for each ad I ran for him. I\ncould go on for a long time, listing the things that I was offered instead of hard cash. The perks were\ngreat—I was never hungry or barefoot—but they didn’t help me pay for operations. It would have\nbeen hard to pay for printing, web hosting, and distribution with a sweet and sour combo and a pair of\nFila.\nFrustrated and perplexed I asked my mentor how to actually get money for my products and\nservices. Frankly I never considered the possibility of such a problem. I assumed that everyone\nwould pay me money. The whole idea of bartering or trading was new to me. It seemed\nunprofessional and somewhat shady. A part of me thought that people were taking advantage of me,\nhoping that I would take whatever they offered. My mentor had a different perspective.\nWhen I approached my mentor for advice, the most recent request for a trade deal was from a\nmajor movie studio. It wanted to place an ad for an upcoming movie in exchange for giving me\nseveral movie passes to the premier. This seemed like a terrible deal to me. I complained to my\nmentor that I had limited advertising space and that I wanted to reserve insertions for paying\ncustomers only. My mentor smiled and said, “Kevin, run a small ad for them and take the passes.” He\nexplained how I could use the passes in various ways. I thought one was especially clever. He\nsuggested that I give some of the passes to a major radio station in the city. In exchange, the radio\nstation would give away the passes to listeners on the air on my behalf. I would also ask the station to\nencourage listeners to consider advertising with my company. That way, I could increase my media’s\nbrand presence, establish strong relationships with the station, and reach thousands of potential\nadvertisers. When he explained all of this, I got really excited. I took his advice, and everything\nworked out just as he said it would.\nAfter receiving and taking his advice, my perspective changed completely. Suddenly, selling\nbecame more fun because I didn’t see myself as a salesman, per se, but as a person who creatively\nleveraged resources to get more of what I wanted. I learned that many of the smaller or local\ncompanies wanted to keep their cash, especially since I was a new vendor. It helped them to offset\nrisk. Larger companies didn’t mind paying the cash. After realizing that, I began to use my local perks\nto entice the big companies for more advertisements. For instance, instead of taking all six pairs of\nshoes from my shoe advertiser, I would only take two. The other four pair I would use to secure long-\nterm advertising contracts with Fortune 100 companies. In other words, the people responsible for\nsigning the contracts would receive some nice sneakers for their children as a thank-you.\nI have structured so many deals in which I strategically used products and services that\ncompanies have offered me instead of money. I have used professional sporting event tickets, tee\ntimes, lavish trips, concert tickets, and other things to find my way to a bigger check that justifies my\napproach. It is probably the most fun and creative part of what I do. Out of this practice, I developed\na love of putting together deals, whether it’s a basic trade or a buyout worth millions of dollars.\nThis strategy works the other way, too. If you want to conserve your cash, find ways to leverage\nwhat you have to get what you want. For example, I was able to secure a deal with a multimillionaire\nsimply by offering to make a substantial donation to his charity. That check, while significant, was\nmuch less than the check I would have had to write in order to secure his involvement in the deal the\nnormal way. This type of creativity pays both ways.\nAs you begin to implement this strategy, be very careful not to overdo it. Choose only certain\ncompanies to engage in this type of arrangement. You must be strategic about every deal and\nunderstand the motives and desires of all parties involved. A common problem is that once a vendor\nknows that you are willing to trade or do nontraditional deals, you may be held to that standard or\nless. Thus, you run the risk of being able to change expectations about types of payment and terms.\nAlso, influencers in the same circles may share the details of your deal with others who under normal\ncircumstances would pay you.\nFinally, entrepreneurs are great at leveraging resources to get what they want. When one\ncompetitor shuns the idea of a trade or nontraditional deal, another competitor accepts it and uses it\nas an advantage. This strategy has worked wonders for me over the years. In fact, I still have pairs of\nbrand-new shoes in my closet that were given to me as part of a deal almost seven years ago. I won’t\nneed a new pair for probably another seven years.\n29) An Idea’s Execution, Not Its Uniqueness, Yields Success\nIdeas are easy. It’s the execution of ideas that really separates the sheep from the goats.\n—Sue Grafton, author\nI hate to rain on your parade, but your idea is not special. There are likely other entrepreneurs or\ncompanies with “your” idea, equally inspired to dominate the business world and to make millions.\nAnd when your idea becomes a solid business generating lots of revenue, you can be sure that\nsomeone is just waiting to capitalize on your idea, too. In Silicon Valley, copycat companies are\ncalled “me-too” companies. You know them. For instance, once Groupon became popular, all sorts of\nme-too companies sprang up. According to a recent MSNBC.com report, over six hundred companies\nhave the same business model as Groupon or a variation on it.\nDespite the fact that your idea is not unique and thus for the taking, you can still boost your\nprobability of success over your competitors. How? Focus on the execution of your idea and make it\nwork better than anyone else on the planet.\nWhen I was in college, everyone had my idea: Create a web-based community for the\nconsortium of colleges and universities in Atlanta. Even after my website became hugely popular,\nsome students would belittle my accomplishments when they met me. They would say things like, “I\nhad that idea.” Or they would comment matter-of-factly, “I wanted to do that.” I didn’t take their\nsnubs to heart, because I knew that the implication of their comments was true: My idea wasn’t\nspecial. In fact, I considered their comments to be a sincere compliment, because I knew that I\nactually had the determination to make the idea a reality. They didn’t.\nA gap the size of the Grand Canyon separates idea and execution. Most people, when they see\nthe huge abyss before them and ponder the work needed to traverse it, never make a move. They are\nparalyzed for a myriad of reasons. It could be the enormity of the task, the lack of skills needed to get\nto the other side, or fear of the unknown. Whatever the reason, those who execute their idea and get to\nthe other side of the canyon will be winners.\nIn order to go from idea to execution and thus secure a major advantage over your competition,\npay close attention to three things that were largely responsible for my early success: speed, team,\nand frugality.\nFirst, \nthe speed of your organization, especially in our fast-paced, technology-driven, I-want-\nit-now world, is most important.\n You must focus on shortening your time to market. When you do\nthis, you stake your claim in the marketplace first and are able to sell to customers before others. It’s\na delicate balance, though, between speed and quality. Your goal should be to release immediately a\nfunctional and a somewhat quality product or service that customers value. Founder of LinkedIn, Reid\nHoffman, said, “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too\nlate.” Well said. In college, my team and I were never fully satisfied with the software we produced,\nbut we understood the need to get the customer using it quickly. We’d have plenty of time later for\nupgrades and improvements.\nSecond, \nyour team must be a well-oiled machine that works harder than any other team.\n The\nadvice is trite but cannot be emphasized enough. Team dynamics can make or break you. Only recruit\nthe best and most dedicated talent that is vested in your idea. Likewise, avoid debilitating deputes\nover equity and the company’s direction. In his book \nThe Founder’s Dilemma\n, Harvard professor\nNoam Wasserman explores common problems that founders go through when starting their\ncompanies. Wasserman provides scholarly research on team dynamics and equity splits among team\nmembers. As his extensive research proved, if you don’t get your team right, the probability of your\nsuccess drops drastically.\nThird, \na frugal start-up is a wise start-up.\n Expenses frequently hinder a company’s ability to\nexecute an idea. The company that can conserve and best use its resources gives itself a considerable\nadvantage. As young entrepreneurs, my team and I decided to take a grassroots approach to everything\nwe did. For example, we used free, open-source technologies to develop our products. Likewise, we\nleveraged our campus contacts to print thousands of signs that advertised our website. The expenses\nwe incurred to make our idea a reality were as close to zero as a company could get. Even when we\nhad money coming in, we continued to operate with a frugal mentality. As a result, when we\nabsolutely needed to spend money to generate growth, we had it and could move fast.\nA common perception of an entrepreneur is the idea-generating, dream-chasing idealist. This\none-sided view overlooks the equally important part of the entrepreneur that is an unyielding\nexecutioner. Facebook’s cofounder Mark Zuckerberg had a big vision to “dominate” communication\non the Internet, and he could communicate his perspective better than anyone. He also knew how to\nmake that vision happen—and he made it happen. If you are banking on the merit of your idea and not\nthe efficiency of its execution, you are headed for trouble. You will probably end up like the people\nwho begrudged my success in college, saying, “I had that idea.”\n30) Find an Enemy\nA man can’t be too careful in the choice of his enemies.\n—Oscar Wilde, Irish writer, poet\nOne of the biggest rivalries in business history is between Apple and Microsoft, two behemoths that\nhave ruled the technology sector for decades. Wherever you go in the world, whether it’s to the\nUnited States or to China, you find the same scenario: Apple users hate Microsoft users and vice\nversa.\nEven the founders of these two companies shared a personal rivalry tantamount to an East\nCoast–West Coast rapper feud. On the one hand, cofounder of Apple Steve Jobs said this about the\ncofounder of Microsoft Bill Gates: “Bill is basically unimaginative and has never invented anything,\nwhich is why I think he’s more comfortable now in philanthropy than technology. He just shamelessly\nripped off other people’s ideas.” On the other hand, Gates had this to say about Jobs: “[Steve Jobs]\nreally never knew much about technology, but he had an amazing instinct for what works.” Gates also\ncalled Jobs “fundamentally odd” and “weirdly flawed.” The evidence of these two founders’ mutual\ndisdain is quite obvious. (And if you were wondering, I suppose Jobs would be Tupac Shakur and\nGates would be The Notorious B.I.G.)\nLike Apple and Microsoft, there are numerous other rivalries in business. Just to name a few,\nthere’s Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, McDonald’s and Burger King, Ford and General Motors, Verizon\nand AT&T, the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees, and the list continues. All of these\ncompanies fight one another for market share and world domination. It can get pretty dirty, too, with\nfirms spying on and suing one another. Despite the negatives, these fierce rivalries have a benefit that\nis seldom mentioned: They fuel a competitive environment that motivates each company to excel.\nEntrepreneurs should be well aware of this phenomenon and how to use it to their advantage.\nAs publisher of an Atlanta magazine, I made sure to find and identify an enemy quickly, and the\nstrategy worked well. Although we had many enemies, we singled out one publication that we utterly\nhated. Our goal was to put it out of business. Although we didn’t put it out of business, we did make\nthe competitive landscape more intense. We made sure that everything we produced was\nexponentially better in quality than our enemy’s work. In fact, my magazine’s success eventually\ncaused our main competitor to increase its costs by printing in color. We knew that we were winning\nat that point. As a result of this noticeable change, my team became even more excited and motivated\nto trample the competition.\nWhen you start a business, immediately choose an enemy that you and your team aspire to crush.\nIdentifying an archrival helps to solidify your team around a common goal and serves as a natural\nmotivator. No one wants to lose in a game of one-on-one. It’s one thing to rally a team around stodgy\ngoals like increasing sales 35 percent for the quarter; it’s another to rally a team around a tangible\nenemy that hates you as much as you hate them. Implementing this basic gamification strategy\nenhances your competitive spirit and at least makes business a lot more exciting for everybody.\n31) Don’t Underestimate Your Competition\nI hate competition.\n—Marat Safin, tennis champion, Russian politician\nWhen entrepreneurs approach me to invest in their companies, I naturally want to know who their\ncompetitors are. It’s a basic question that any investor would ask.\nSome entrepreneurs answer the question thoroughly and confidently. They are not afraid to\nacknowledge what the competitive landscape looks like. Others equivocate, either because they don’t\nwant the fact that competitors exist to diminish the appeal of their idea or they simply haven’t done\ntheir homework.\nOf the two responses, I am more concerned about and hesitant toward entrepreneurs who seem\ndelusional or unprepared. They often respond to my inquiry, proudly saying, “We do not have any\ncompetitors.”\nI want to respond to them, “Yeah, right.”\nThe answer that they gave to make their venture appear more attractive actually made it more\nunattractive. Instead of telling them what I’d like to say, I keep quiet and focus on companies that are\nbetter suited for investment.\nTheoretically, every company in a free market has competition, even if it is pioneering a\ncompletely new market category. A customer’s dollar can be spent in millions of ways, and with\nmillions of businesses. The competition may not be obvious or simple to find, but it’s there. Your job\nas an entrepreneur is to find and to assess the most threatening competition. A more in-depth step\nincludes identifying and analyzing companies that could easily leverage their resources—like\ndistribution channels, investment capital, or intellectual capital—to enter your market and to compete\nwith you.\nA common mistake that mostly start-ups make when researching their competition is overlooking\nsubstitutes. What are substitutes? According to N. Gregory Mankiw, an economist from Harvard\nUniversity, “Substitutes are often pairs of goods that are used in place of each other, such as hot dogs\nand hamburgers, sweaters and sweatshirts, and movie tickets and video rentals.” Substitutes can also\nbe defined as “two goods for which an increase in the price of one leads to an increase in the demand\nfor the other.” Substitutes can harm a company, especially in a price war.\nOften entrepreneurs focus only on other companies that have very similar business models. To\nexpand on the examples given in the definition, a hot dog company may only research other hot dog\ncompanies, a sweater company may only research other sweater companies, and so on. This myopic\nperspective ignores the competitive threat of dissimilar substitutes and can cause the downfall of a\ngood company.\nFor example, it could be argued that Blockbuster’s demise occurred because it failed to\nadequately assess the threat of a substitute, Netflix, which was the first company to offer a DVD-by-\nmail service. As the price of Blockbuster’s video rental services increased, so did the demand of\nNetflix’s services, which were so much more convenient than walking into a brick-and-mortar store.\nHad Blockbuster correctly assessed the threat in the beginning, it would have had a better chance to\nsurvive by implementing its own DVD-by-mail service. Instead, it increased its video rental prices\nand didn’t introduce a DVD-by-mail service until 2004, years after Netflix had seized a large portion\nof the market.\nNever tell a potential investor that you have absolutely no competition. Any seasoned investor\ninterprets such a statement as, “These guys are full of themselves and naïve enough to think that they\nhave no competition. This is a waste of my time.” Instead, introduce your competition, but describe\nthe severity of the competitive threat. Moreover, no matter if you are in the initial stages of\ndeveloping your start-up or if you are a developed company, don’t underestimate the competitive\nthreat of substitutes. Committing either one of these mistakes will likely cause you to have a\nBlockbuster ending.\n32) Ask for What You Want\nAsk and it will be given to you.\n—Matthew 7:7\nWhile driving on the major freeway that runs through the heart of Atlanta, I saw a huge banner on the\nside of a mid-rise. The banner promoted the grand opening of a new residential building in Midtown,\na popular and prime area of the city. Considering that the building had vacancies, I thought that the\nowner would be a great prospective advertiser for one of my media outlets that target young adults. I\nwrote down the phone number and website listed on the banner and reached out a few days later.\nWithin no time, I was able to set up a meeting with the builder and leasing agent.\nAfter a brief meeting I closed the sale rather quickly. My intuition paid off. At the time, it was\none of the biggest deals I had ever closed. I was especially excited about the deal, but I dreamed of\nhaving more. I thought, \nHow cool would it be to have an office here, right in the center of town with\na spectacular view of the Atlanta skyline?\n For a second I pondered asking the builder if I could have\none of the large units as an office. I thought that the idea was ridiculous, but then I remembered some\nof the stories my mentor told me about how he was able to close some out-of-this-world deals. I\nchanged my mind. Since I had already finalized the deal, I figured that it wouldn’t hurt to ask. So I\nasked the owner of the building, “May I have one of the units to use as an office?” The builder\nreplied, “Sure. That’s not a problem at all.” In addition to paying me well for my company’s services,\nhe gave me one of the best units in his building.\nWithin a few weeks I was moving into my brand-new, thirteen-hundred-square-foot, fully\nfurnished office for my company. It was quite a space, with a perfect location and beautiful views of\nthe city. In fact, the office was located across the street from PricewaterhouseCoopers and Google’s\nnew office. This new space would serve as my company’s headquarters for a few years. My ten-\nperson team and I loved it. If I had stayed quiet and let my doubts take over, I would have missed this\ngreat opportunity.\nWhen I started my business I had no idea of the possibilities that would be available to me. I\nnever imagined that I would be given a beautiful office space in a prime, urban location simply by\nasking. Neither did I imagine that I would be able to simply ask a client for a luxury car and receive\nit. After closing some amazing deals by just asking for what I wanted, my expectations for what was\npossible changed completely. I learned that when the scope of your reality is limited by your\nexperience, it’s hard to imagine anything beyond it. Once I widened the scope of my reality, I was\nable to negotiate unbelievable deals.\nAs I alluded to earlier, my mentor taught me to ask for what I want in business. He believed that\nnothing was impossible. Without his guidance, I would have missed several opportunities simply\nbecause I was too afraid to ask for them. For some reason, perhaps because of my young age, I didn’t\nthink that I deserved them. Thankfully, my mentor was able to open my mind to bigger ideas and to\nshow me through his own experiences what was possible. Ultimately, I learned that there’s a big\ndifference between thinking and knowing what is possible versus having the courage to ask for it. If\nyou want something, I encourage you to ask for it. You will be surprised to see what it gets you from\ntime to time.\n33) No Competition Means Your Idea Probably Has Little Merit\nCompetition is very good. . . . It’s what makes one strive to be better.\n—Christine Lahti, actress, film director\nNinety-five percent of the time, arrogance leads entrepreneurs to believe that they have no\ncompetition in the marketplace. However, on rare occasions, arrogance isn’t the true cause of this\nbelief. Instead, arrogance is an effect of a more basic cause, and veterans of business know this.\nWhat’s the cause? It’s actually a thorough and accurate assessment of the current competitive\nenvironment that yields no competitors. The difference, though, is that arrogant entrepreneurs think\nthat the nonexistence of competition means sure success while veterans know that this likely means\nthat the idea is not viable for various reasons.\nConsidering this, entrepreneurs must learn how to interpret the results of their research on\ncompetition when it produces no threats. Assuming that no threats were identified and that your\nresearch methodology was solid, you must take your market research to the next level, which includes\ndiscovering specific reasons that an idea has no competitors. The most common and important reason\nis that the idea isn’t good. The four most common reasons that a business idea is unfeasible and\ntherefore has no competitors in the market are as follows:\n1. \nNo demand exists for the product.\n For example, due to low demand, the DeLorean, a\nfuturistic sports car that debuted in 1981, was a failure. In fact, few people today know that the\nDeLorean was indeed a real car and not just a fictitious, flying car in the popular \nBack to the Future\nmovie series, which began four years later. Apparently, when the DeLorean hit the market, there was\nlittle demand for an overpriced sports car that went from 0 to 60 mph in a slow 10.5 seconds. The\nmagazine \nRoad and Track\n gave the car a poor review, saying, “It’s not a barn burner.” Perhaps the\nBack to the Future\n series was on to something—if only the makers of the DeLorean could go back in\ntime and warn themselves that their invention would be a flop because of lack of demand.\n2. \nThe market is too small.\n Perhaps the most recent surprising example of a market being too\nsmall is the story of the Segway, the two-wheeled electric vehicle that was all the excitement before\nits launch in 2001. What was once the most anticipated invention to the hit the market is now all but a\ncomplete failure. The company that produces the vehicle expected sales to reach as much as one\nhundred thousand units within the first thirteen months, but it didn’t even come close. In a stark\ncontrast to company expectations, only about thirty thousand Segways were sold between 2001 and\n2007. Segway greatly overestimated the market size for its new category of vehicle, and thus its\nsignature product has become a novelty, not the revolutionary means of transportation it was\nproclaimed to be.\n3. \nThe business is not profitable.\n How long is too long to wait for profits? Two years? Five?\nTen? Well, for the hipster car-rental company Zipcar, the wait for profits will have to be longer than\ntwelve years. The company has yet to make a profit since its founding in 2000, and it doesn’t look\nlike profits will arrive any time soon. According to \nThe New York Times\n, Zipcar has accumulated\nlosses of $65.4 million, including a net loss of $14.7 million in 2010. How long one should wait to\nreap profits is debatable, but what isn’t debatable is the fact that profits are an important measure of\nsuccess. After all, you are in business to make a profit. At some point you run out of possible\nadjustments or lose hope that the market will develop. A business that isn’t profitable, let alone not\nprofitable for twelve years, is a red flag.\n4. \nThe barriers to entry are too great.\n The pharmaceutical industry in the United States has\nquite a few high hurdles that make it difficult to enter into the enormous drug market. Perhaps one of\nthe biggest and most unpredictable hurdles is the Food and Drug Administration, a government agency\nthat approves and regulates new drugs. In 2011, Contrave, a weight-loss drug developed by Orexigen\nTherapeutics, was denied FDA approval—a huge blow to the company. According to \nThe New York\nTimes\n, the FDA told the drugmaker that to win approval it must first do a long-term study to\ndemonstrate that the drug does not raise the risk of heart attacks. Hundreds of millions of dollars are\nat stake as the company regroups. Investors hope to get the drug approved as soon as possible to\nrecoup their investments. To that the FDA would reply, “Fat chance!”\nIn short, no competition probably means you have a bad business idea on your hands. There are\nseveral reasons for bad business ideas, but these four are quite common and useful to remember,\nespecially when analyzing a barren marketplace. Therefore, each one warrants your special attention.\nOften what looks like a harmless path to success is really a dangerous path leading you right off a\ncliff.\n34) Put Out Fires Quickly\nThe man who has no problems is out of the game.\n—Elbert Hubbard, writer, philosopher\nWhen checking my e-mail one morning, I noticed an urgent subject: “Web Site Down. Call\nImmediately.” This wasn’t a good sign. I knew then that it was going to be a long day—and it was.\nUntil that moment, I had never had a customer contact me about a major problem with a product\nmy company created. I didn’t know what to do. No one had told me how to deal with an irate\ncustomer. I was learning on the job.\nThe disgruntled customer was a major media company. Only a year after I started my company,\nthis customer took a chance and bought the first version of our content management system,\nOmniPublisher. The company used the software to produce the online version of its newspaper.\nOmniPublisher included web hosting through a third-party vendor, and that was the problem.\nJust a few months after the media company purchased our web-based software, I received the\nfateful e-mail notifying me that the company’s administrative website was down. Apparently, our web\nhosting partner was having a problem with its servers, preventing our customers from making updates\nto their site. Even worse, our clients’ readership couldn’t access the clients’ sites. All visitors saw\nthe dreaded and embarrassing Error 404 page.\nI immediately contacted our client’s chief technology officer and told him that we were taking\ncare of the situation. I didn’t want to make that call, because I expected a tongue-lashing. It wasn’t so\nbad after all. He appreciated my swift response to his e-mail but was eager to get the problem\nresolved. I spent all day putting pressure on the web host to fix their servers. I couldn’t do much else,\nexcept wait for the vendor and mitigate the situation with the customer by offering concessions. I was\nstressed like never before. The web host eventually fixed the servers that evening. As a result, my\ncompany made changes to its web host plan and learned a valuable lesson about responding to\ncustomer complaints.\nMost importantly, we formalized the way we handle urgent, customer complaints. We use this\nsimple five-step process:\n1. Respond quickly and calmly.\n2. Listen attentively after you offer a sincere apology.\n3. Tell the customer how you plan to address the problem in detail with a specific time frame.\n4. Give updates often on the progress of your resolution.\n5. When the issue is resolved, make sure the customer is satisfied.\nNot only will this process help you to handle similar problems in a professional way, but it will also\nprovide a guideline by which you can evaluate the effectiveness of your response.\nTo be great in business means to be great at putting out fires quickly. They are inevitable, and\none of the biggest fires you’ll have to put out is an urgent customer complaint. Making sure that you\nresolve customer complaints in the best way possible, so as to ensure that customers stay with your\ncompany, should not be something you learn while on the job, if you can help it. Prepare for the fire,\nand your chances of avoiding a customer conflagration will be much better.\n35) Have an Exit Strategy\nBegin with the end in mind.\n—Stephen Covey, best-selling author, \nThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\nWhen I shut down my college magazine (my third business), it had lasted six good years. During its\nrun, the magazine was declared one of the top independent college magazines in the country. The last\nissue was published in 2008 just a few months before the beginning of the Great Recession, which\nalso took down several other publications, big and small. At that point, advertising sales for the\npublishing industry came to a screeching halt, a harbinger of things to come. If I knew what I know\nnow, I would have sold my magazine in 2007 after its record year of revenues in 2006. As they say,\nhindsight is 20/20.\nI didn’t sell the magazine because I made the mistake of believing that I would always be\ninterested in keeping the business. I also assumed that I would want to be in the print publishing\nbusiness forever. I was wrong. Around the same time that the market tanked, I was ready to get rid of\nthe business, and I didn’t enjoy print publishing nearly as much as when I started. As a result of the\nconfluence of the recession and my eagerness to get out of the business, my magazine just died. I made\nno real attempts to sell it or even give it away. Even if I had made a legitimate effort to sell it, the\nmarket conditions would have made it next to impossible to pull it off. Sadly, all was lost.\nHaving learned the hard way, I now start a business with an exit in mind. Unfortunately, few\nyoung entrepreneurs take the same approach. In fact, a recent survey conducted by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers found that only 54 percent of business owners within five years of\nretirement had an exit strategy. For businesses with revenues under $10 million, only 30 percent had\nan exit strategy.\nConsidering these alarming statistics, you probably have not considered an exit strategy for your\nbusiness. In other words, you could end up like me, having to watch your business die at some point\nwithout getting the value out of it. Or you could sell your business for less than its true value. Both\nsituations can be avoided if you plan ahead.\nThe biggest benefit to planning your exit from the very beginning is that it helps you to make\ngood decisions for your business. For example, had I planned an exit, I would have been looking for\nopportune times to sell my magazine. I would have realized, after reaching record profits in 2006 and\nafter the tremendous growth in popularity of digital devices and digital advertising, that it was the\nperfect time to cash out. Of course, there is no guarantee that I would have avoided the Great\nRecession, but at least I would have given myself a chance to pursue great opportunities.\nAs one of my favorite entrepreneurs, Earvin “Magic” Johnson, said, “If you fail to plan your exit\nstrategy, you can pretty much plan on failing.” Johnson knows what he is talking about, as he has sold\nmany businesses and continues to build his business empire. In 2010 Johnson sold his 4.5 percent\nequity stake in the Los Angeles Lakers, making a huge profit. He knew it was time to move on to\nbigger things, like purchasing the Los Angeles Dodgers recently for $2 billion.\nMagic Johnson is one example of several elite entrepreneurs who seem to have impeccable\ntiming and good fortune, but when you look closer, you find the secret to their success: an exit strategy\nplanned from day one. Despite how awkward or how uncomfortable it may be, plan an exit strategy\nwhen you start your business. Smart entrepreneurs not only focus on creating their business but also\nplan how to get out of it the best way possible.\nChapter 2\nEducation\nFormal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.\n—Jim Rohn, entrepreneur, author, motivational speaker\nWhen you become an entrepreneur, your education is just beginning. In fact, in order to be at the\ntop of your game, you must continually seek and devour information that will make you and your\nbusiness better. An entrepreneur who stops learning stops earning.\nUnfortunately, most secondary schools and colleges don’t teach how to attain entrepreneurial\nsuccess. For this reason, some of the most successful entrepreneurs left school early, eager to gain\nreal-world experience. Entrepreneurs educate themselves primarily through reading books, studying\nsuccessful people, perusing industry magazines, attending conferences, and countless other ways.\nIn this brief chapter, you learn how too much formal education can be a hindrance and how your\nability to educate yourself affects your bottom line.\n36) School Is Not Necessarily Education\nDevelop a passion for learning. If you do, you will never cease to grow.\n—Anthony J. D’Angelo, entrepreneur, education trailblazer\nWhen I arrived at Morehouse College, I was focused on doing well in my classes so that I could get a\nhigh-paying job as a computer programmer. After catching the entrepreneurial bug during my\nsophomore year, I was just trying to graduate with a decent GPA. At that point, school was a barrier,\na prison preventing me from doing full-time what I loved. I vividly remember sitting in one of my\ncore classes—religion, to be exact—and feeling trapped. That day I tuned out the professor, pulled\nout a piece of paper, and began working on computer algorithms. I felt that I was learning so much\nmore pursuing my entrepreneurial endeavors. I had had enough of school. When I graduated, I was\nready to sprint off campus.\nIt turns out that my experience is common among entrepreneurs. In his book \nThe Millionaire\nMind\n, Dr. Thomas J. Stanley dedicates forty-five pages to describe the school days of America’s\nmillionaires. A great majority of them are self-made entrepreneurs. He writes, “Millionaires also\nreport that they were not A students in college. In fact, only about three in ten reported receiving a\ngreater percentage of As than either Bs, Cs, Ds, or Fs. About 90 percent graduated from college.\nOverall, their GPA was a 2.9—good but not outstanding.” Likewise, Dr. Stanley found that most\nmillionaires did well on the SAT, but not excellent. His research confirmed that characteristics other\nthan great school performance were more significant factors in most millionaires’ success. Some of\nthese characteristics include being honest, disciplined, amiable, and diligent, and having great\nleadership skills.\nRealizing that there is actually a negative correlation between the amount of schooling after\ncollege and entrepreneurial success, some wealthy individuals discourage students from pursuing\nschool if they have entrepreneurial talents and great ideas at an early age. Most recently, Peter Thiel,\nthe billionaire cofounder of PayPal and angel investor, started his innovative and shocking program\nthat pays students to drop out of college. His program chose four bright college students who show\namazing entrepreneurial promise and funded each of their companies with $100,000. Thiel said in an\ninterview with ABC News, “Learning is good. Credentialing and debt is very bad. College gives\npeople learning and also takes away future opportunities by loading the next generation down with\ndebt.” I can relate to Thiel’s quotation. Many of my friends would love to start a business but are\nstuck with high student loan payments that could be used as start-up capital. I was fortunate to receive\na full scholarship from NASA to attend college. Without this boon I probably would not have chosen\nthe entrepreneurial path.\nConsidering the frustrating experience of my college days, the compelling data from \nThe\nMillionaire Mind\n, and the popularity of Peter Thiel’s college dropout program, you may believe that\nI support young entrepreneurs dropping out of college or forgetting college altogether. I do not.\nCollege is an important experience for entrepreneurs. People often point out that Mark Zuckerberg\nand other successful entrepreneurs dropped out of college, but their examples \ndid\n at some point attend\ncollege. As in Zuckerberg’s case, there were huge benefits from attending college. We can all agree\nthat Facebook wouldn’t be what it is without Zuckerberg’s Harvard experience. David Kilpatrick,\nauthor of \nThe Facebook Effect\n, says, “Facebook’s ultimate success owes a lot to the fact that it began\nat college. That’s where people’s social networks are densest.” I couldn’t agree more, given that I\nstarted my first profitable business for college students in college.\nThe passionate debate persists about whether college and advanced degrees are worth it for\nentrepreneurs. However, everyone can agree that although you may not be in school, your education\nshould never stop. Entrepreneurs who excel educate themselves constantly about new technology,\nbusiness strategies, and so on, and you don’t necessarily have to be in school to do that.\n37) You’re in No Rush to Get an MBA\n“You wasted $150,000 on an education you could have got for a buck fifty in late charges at the public library.”\n—Matt Damon, in \nGood Will Hunting\nWhen I was introduced by my student host, I stood up and briefly addressed the room full of second-\nyear Harvard Business School students from all around the world. Surprisingly, I was the only\nprospective student among a handful to stand up during the pre-class introduction, adhering to what I\nthought was proper and respectful protocol. The other visitors were shy and perhaps a bit intimidated\nby the Ivy League crowd. Because of my display of confidence and cordiality, I received the warmest\nwelcome from the students. In fact, when my host mentioned that I attended Morehouse College, a few\nstudents shouted with excitement. Other than this warm reception and conversation with students\nbetween classes, my campus visit to Harvard Business School in April 2007 was much different than\nI had imagined.\nThat morning, April 12, I arrived at Harvard Business School a few minutes behind schedule. I\nforgot that the business school is separate from the main Harvard campus; it is located on the opposite\nside of the Charles River, perhaps a not-so-subtle indication of its lofty status. After calling\nadmissions and receiving directions from a rather unpleasant administrator, I found my meeting place:\nthe Dillon House. From there, a student host took me to class with her. On the way she answered my\nquestions and introduced me to some of her friends. After attending class I found some old college\nfriends who were now HBS students, and they took me to lunch. We passionately debated and\ndiscussed the meaning of life and the classic book \nThe 48 Laws of Power\n. Following that I walked\naround, taking in the sights and smells; visited the Coop or HBS bookstore, buying an HBS T-shirt;\nmanaged to get lost in the underground tunnels, trying to avoid the snow; and ended up in the library,\nreading my \nFORTUNE Small Business\n magazine while waiting for my ride. That was my visit.\nAt the time, attending business school to get my MBA was not a top priority. After college I was\nnot eager to go back to school at all. Instead, I wanted to continue as a fearless young entrepreneur,\ngrowing my business and pursing opportunities that required my full energy and resources. However,\nI eventually caved to the pressure of my peers, who thought it was the logical thing to do. Also, my\nparents encouraged me to get a graduate degree because “the longer I waited, the harder it would be\nto return.” And I had a highly inflated self-image. What better way to massage my ego than to obtain\nan MBA from Harvard Business School! So I made the trip to Boston, where I grew up, in hopes that\na campus visit would increase my excitement for HBS in particular, and for graduate school in\ngeneral.\nShockingly, the campus visit did more harm than good. The ivy-clad campus, known for its\ncharm and majesty, had a gloomy effect on me. I found it to be off-putting and uninspiring.\nFurthermore, the classes I attended were perfunctory and boring. I am afraid to admit it, but I almost\nfell asleep during one class titled Leadership Accountability and Ethics. In this class, it seemed that\nno substantive conversation took place, as if the professor and students were just talking to hear\nthemselves talk. I am sure that there were some redeeming characteristics of the school, but I surely\nmissed them. It could have been that I was out of my league. Regardless, I left the campus visit highly\ndisappointed and eager to head home, back to the exciting life of a start-up CEO. At the end of that\nday I realized that my presence was a sign of my giving up or at best putting on hold my\nentrepreneurial dreams.\nAttending Harvard Business School at that time, if I were accepted, would have been a mistake.\nI would have been completely miserable and frustrated. In the same way that college almost\nsmothered my fiery ambition to pursue entrepreneurship, graduate school would have strangled me. I\nwould have eventually succumbed to the luring pull of a high-paying consulting job or chosen to\ncrunch numbers for a New York hedge fund. Not even the prestige and countless benefits of receiving\na Harvard MBA were going to pull me away from my business and doing what I loved.\nSince then, I continue to consider going back to school, but not just to get a degree. Now that I\nam a little wiser, I have a genuine interest in the knowledge taught; I aspire to learn as much as I can\nabout the business world, and academia is a great place to do that in a focused environment. I recently\nread Philip Delves Broughton’s book \nAhead of the Curve\n, which chronicles his life-altering\nexperience as an HBS student. I have also talked to friends who have their degrees from Harvard and\nother great business schools. Many of them still struggle to find gratifying jobs. In fact, many of them\ndiscourage me from going. I agree with them. After weighing all the costs, I am still not convinced of\nthe value. The only way I will seriously consider it is if I receive a full scholarship and if I can\ncontinue to run my business.\nIn the meantime, I do what all successful entrepreneurs do: learn as much as possible about\nbusiness constantly. That includes subscribing to industry magazines, reading white papers, attending\nconferences, interviewing experts, examining case studies, and so on. Entrepreneurs fervently seek\nknowledge to gain and to maintain a competitive advantage for their business.\nOne of my mentors heard I was considering Harvard Business School and scolded me. He said,\n“What would that degree do for you? You’d ultimately go back to running your business. You’d lose\ntime and money. You don’t need Harvard; Harvard needs you!” Ignoring his head-inflating words, my\nmentor’s argument made pragmatic sense. Considering my unique situation, the opportunity cost of\ngoing to school would be too great. In fact, attending school could kill my business altogether. At that\npoint, I realized that obtaining my MBA would probably not be in my near future. Given that, I\ndecided to resort to the next best thing: Hiring business school graduates to help me run my business.\nSo far, it has worked out great.\nChapter 3\nPeople\n“I love humanity. It’s people I can’t stand.”\n—Linus van Pelt, in \nPeanuts\nIn his classic book \nHow to Win Friends and Influence People\n, Dale Carnegie mentions Charles\nSchwab, one of the first in American business to earn an annual salary more than $1 million. Schwab\nattributed his high salary to his ability to deal with people. As the first president of the newly formed\nUnited States Steel Company in 1921, he had amazing charisma and enthusiasm that inspired his\nemployees to greatness.\nThe story of Charles Schwab’s ascendancy in business underlines the importance of dealing with\npeople in any business. As an entrepreneur, your ability to repel bad people and to attract good\npeople, whether in the office or in your bedroom, makes all the difference in your level of success.\nIn this chapter, you learn what matters most when dealing with people, so that you can surround\nyourself with the kind of people who move your business forward.\n38) Spend the Majority of Your Time with People Smarter Than\nYou\nAs iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.\n—Proverbs 27:17\nThe average person is intimidated by smart people. I know firsthand: Whenever people find out what\nI scored on an SAT exam, they are shocked. (I have very proud relatives.) Some try to stump me on\nthe spot with a complex riddle or math question. Others just look at me in disbelief or with gut-\nwrenching jealousy. I can sense their fear of being judged. They watch their grammar and double-\ncheck their math; some point out a major accomplishment of their own or try to sound as learned as\npossible. It’s an awkward situation, but I know it’s only human nature at work. We’d all like to think\nthat we are the smartest person in the room even if we know it’s not true.\nIf given a choice to spend a week quarantined with really smart people or people of average\nintelligence, the average Jane would choose people of average intelligence. Who can blame her? But\nwhat a tragedy! It’s as if Jane’s fear, ego, or yearning to fit in prevents her from growing and learning.\nOvercoming this feeling of insecurity is the first step to ascending to greatness.\nWhen in high school, I learned the value of hanging around brilliant people. Somehow I ended\nup befriending some really bright students. I make it sound coincidental, but the relationships I\ndeveloped were probably strong because I was a social outcast, too, like they were. The geeks\nalways are, right? Nevertheless, the end result was the same; I was able to learn so much from them\nand therefore increase my abilities. For example, in 1996, we were building dynamic websites for\ninteractive presentations in class. Also, we were using programs to exchange data via our infrared\nports on our Hewlett Packard scientific calculators. (And no, we didn’t use the program to cheat!) We\nwere ahead of our times in many ways. Many of my friends went on to Harvard, MIT, and other great\nschools.\nToday, I continue to maintain an ever-expanding circle of intelligent people. My circle includes\nlongtime CEOs, technologists, investors, and others, many of whom come from the top universities\nand companies in the world. They make me feel inadequate and sometimes just really stupid, but I am\nOK with that because I know that I learn so much from them. It’s not easy to find and to develop solid\nrelationships with smart people, especially as you grow older, but it’s worth the effort.\nSeveral quotations eloquently convey my point. For example, business philosopher and author E.\nJames Rohn says, “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” I especially\nlike this quotation because it incorporates mathematics, and it forces you to think about who those\nfive people are. Likewise, this quotation is popular in Spanish-speaking countries: “\nDime con quién\nandas y te diré quién eres.\n” Roughly translated, it means, “Tell me who you associate with, and I’ll\ntell you who you are.” As these quotations imply, we cannot help but pick up the habits and thoughts\nof those around us. Therefore, it behooves every entrepreneur—and anyone else who strives for\nsuccess—to be surrounded with the brightest and best minds.\n39) Office Space Is Not a Priority, But a Good Team Is\nI think, team first. It allows me to succeed, it allows my team to succeed.\n—LeBron James, NBA champion\nOne of the most costly mistakes I have made as an entrepreneur is to rent high-end office space,\nthinking that it would foster growth through increased productivity and project a more professional\nimage. It did none of these. In fact, all it did was increase operating expenses and precipitate a drop\nin profits.\nMy company’s culture started out quite differently from that of a traditional corporation, yet I felt\nthe need to emulate a more corporate culture. Boy, was I wrong! As any veteran entrepreneur will tell\nyou, the culture you start with will probably be the culture you end up with. Trying to get employees\nand staff to adopt a more rigid culture after years of having a relaxed culture is quite difficult. I\nlearned the hard way. I ignored the fact that my staff enjoyed their flexibility and start-up identity.\nThey resented the idea of having to come to the office at new mandatory times to do their work. Most\nof them worked for me because they were excellent team members and didn’t need supervision or\nmicromanagement. They were motivated to perform and to deliver in large part because of the\nflexibility our company afforded them. And they believed in what we were doing.\nAfter the move to the new, plush office and the change to the culture, many employees became\nless productive. For instance, workers who were normally great in the morning now had morning\ncommutes. Some of their commutes were one hour each way. Consequently, reports and important\ndocuments would arrive later in the day. Also, our meeting schedules changed, as we now adjusted\ntimes to accommodate traffic patterns. Based on what we were used to, the scheduling became a bit\nridiculous. These are just a few changes that caused productivity to drop and anxiety to increase.\nI also thought that having a nice office would project a more professional image and attract more\nprestigious clients. That didn’t necessarily happen either. While clients would compliment our\nwonderful facilities and impressive skyline views of Buckhead, they were still most concerned with\nthe quality of our products and services. Ultimately, that was most important to them.\nNowadays, having an office seems to be out of style. Not only is it not cool, but it is not smart in\na slow economy if you don’t need it. Because of this trend, there are now so many virtual office\noptions. Regus, one of the largest of these virtual companies, gives you several options, ranging from\na traditional corporate office to a mere mailbox with a physical address. A customer of Regus can\nhave a physical address in over 1,500 different locations around the world; some of these addresses\nare quite prestigious. You can also have someone answer your calls or your staff’s calls and route\nthem to wherever you want. In other words, you can give the impression of having a full-fledged,\nmultinational company when in fact you just have a clever façade.\nAcquiring office space should always be justified by how it will improve your business and\nraise your profits. Office space is a luxury, not a necessity. I suggest that you adequately weigh the\npros and cons. Most entrepreneurs, especially new ones, find more cons than pros. Save the money\nyou would invest in office space to finance things that get you a solid return. Certainly, don’t do what\nI did and jeopardize losing a great team to simply upgrade an office.\n40) What You Wear Isn’t What You’re Worth\nClothes don’t make the man.\n—Unknown\nApparently, Wall Street investors prefer that disruption be applied to business and not to fashion.\nWhen Mark Zuckerberg, cofounder of Facebook, began his IPO tour to persuade Wall Street\ninvestors to purchase stock in his company, he showed up in his iconic hoodie. In doing so, he\ncontinued a tradition of technology CEOs who shun formality, especially when it comes to dress.\nThat’s right, no million-dollar R. Jewels Diamond suit for Zuckerberg, whose über-casual garb often\nshocks the stodgy business types.\nInterestingly, Zuckerberg’s alleged lack of fashion sense was perceived as a not-so-subtle slight\nto the New York City financial world, where a Brooks Brothers suit and a Rolex are the acceptable\nuniform and “successory.” Analysts were all agog. In fact, Wedbush’s managing director Michael\nPachter, an analyst, commented, “I’m not sure [Zuckerberg] is the right guy to run a corporation.” He\nalso said,\nMark and his signature hoodie: He’s actually showing investors he doesn’t care that much;\nhe’s going to be him. I think that’s a mark of immaturity. I think that he has to realize he’s\nbringing investors in as a new constituency right now, and I think he’s got to show them the\nrespect that they deserve because he’s asking them for their money.\nThese senseless comments, in addition to causing a whirlwind of backlash from the Silicon Valley\nfaction and its casually clothed followers, affirm a basic point that I have always believed: Your\nworth should be a function of your aptitude, not your apparel. People like Pachter believe that the\nclothes make the man. This notion is ludicrous, and Zuckerberg, whose company at the time was\nworth nearly $100 billion, is the living antithesis of this corporate canon. Perhaps Pachter should try\nwearing a hoodie, so that he can loosen up and focus on what really matters—respecting the money\nand the man who generated it.\nWhen it comes to what is acceptable to wear when doing business, conventional wisdom\ndemands that you dress to impress, that you project the most professional image. However, my\nexperience has been that the “suits,” as they are affectionately known in Silicon Valley, are no more\nsubstantive than the “hoodies.” In fact, the hoodies are often less concerned with social norms and\nmore concerned about developing the best product possible or monetizing their inventions.\nDon’t get me wrong. I am not condoning that you dress to the point of being offensive. For\nexample, when his company was young, Steve Jobs, the cofounder of Apple, was notorious for his\ncounterculture dress, long hair, and body odor (only to be outdone in his mature years by a black\nturtleneck, loose-fit jeans, and running shoes). His coworkers constantly complained that he smelled\nbad because of his vegan diet and that he would begin picking at his feet during important meetings.\nNow that’s just bizarre no matter how much of a genius you are.\nWithout going beyond the extremes of ridiculousness, wear what is comfortable to you to\nperform your best. Respectable and comfortable are not mutually exclusive. If a person cannot see\npast the irrelevancy of your clothing to assess the relevancy of your idea, perhaps you should move\non. Cultural norms are changing for the better such that ideas are more important than if you’re\nwearing Izod.\nIronically, Zuckerberg’s bold move to wear a hoodie during his IPO road show says much more\nabout his confidence than if he were to don the most expensive designer suit in the world. Besides, he\nowns a majority of his company, so what we think about what he wears doesn’t really matter, and that\nsupports what I have always believed. Beyond the patina of pretense that is fashion, there exists\nsomething much more important: the value of your ideas. The reality is that with or without a hoodie\nMark Zuckerberg is still worth billions of dollars. That should be the end of discussion.\nDuring Facebook’s historic IPO, I got my wish: Zuckerberg wore a hoodie and sandals when he\nrang in the bell on the first day of trading for his company. I wasn’t surprised. (Let’s not forget that his\nbusiness card reads, “I’m CEO, bitch.”) That monumental dress-down day was the ultimate proof that\nwhat you wear isn’t what you’re worth.\n41) You Don’t Always Have to Be the Smartest One in the Room\nYou never really learn much from hearing yourself speak.\n—George Clooney, actor, director\nHave you ever listened to a CEO of a major company speak and wonder how in the world that person\ngot to be CEO? Perhaps this “imposter” is not very articulate at all, or has no clue about the company\nand seems to be more like a figurehead than a deserving CEO. I think we all have experienced this\nscenario at one time or another.\nWhen sizing up CEOs, we often make a huge mistake of trying to fit them into a box. There are so\nmany stereotypes of what a CEO of a certain company should be like. For instance, a cool tech start-\nup should have a spindly, baby-faced young male who wears a hoodie and flip-flops. He speaks\npassionately and is knowledgeable, but his cadence is robotic. On the other hand, a financial services\ncompany should have an athletic, well-groomed male who wears an expensive suit with highly\npolished shoes. He is confident and charming. I could go on, but you get the idea. Whenever a CEO\ndoesn’t fit nicely into our stereotype, we automatically question the company.\nThe reality is that CEOs come in all different forms, and more often than not we are unable to\nfully witness all the talents of a CEO, especially if she is only speaking on a panel. Not every CEO is\nlike Steve Jobs, who seemed to have it all—from piercing intelligence to amazing intuition. (We’ll\nforget about the turtlenecks and temper tantrums for the moment.) Some CEOs are brilliant\ntechnologists. Others are great managers and know how to bring the best out of their people, and some\nCEOs are just great visionaries. As I matured as an entrepreneur, I learned to respect all types\nequally, but there was one experience I had at a young age that enabled me to begin to really\nappreciate the variety and its value.\nShortly after I decided to become an entrepreneur and started my first company, I attended a\npanel with a highly respected and venerated CEO in Atlanta. This CEO was a legend. Because of his\nlarger-than-life reputation and tremendous success, I expected him to be the quintessential CEO. You\nknow: charming, tall, and teeming with confidence. He was the complete opposite. In fact, I couldn’t\nhelp but feel sorry for the man at times during his interview, because he could barely form a basic\nsentence with subject and verb. It was extremely difficult to follow him. Boy, was I in for a surprise,\nthough. Despite my initial disappointment and difficulty in understanding him, I learned one of the\nbiggest lessons I’ve learned during my several years as an entrepreneur. Toward the end of the panel,\nhe looked at the large audience and said while stuttering, “I may not be the best speaker or the most\narticulate, but I know how to put together the right people. And I don’t have to be the smartest person\nin the room all the time.”\nHis final comment was so powerful and sums up my point. That evening, I learned that the most\nsuccessful CEOs are the most humble. They know that they don’t have all the answers; they know that\nthey need help. If you are one of those entrepreneurs full of bravado who knows everything and is\nunwilling to listen to and to hire others, especially those smarter than you, you’ll only get so far. The\nbest entrepreneurs don’t always have to be the smartest one in the room. They know better.\n42) Talent Trumps Seniority\nI’d rather have a lot of talent and a little experience than a lot of experience and a little talent.\n—John Wooden, American basketball coach\nThe tension in the office was high. A burly senior developer looked my manager right in the eyes and\nshouted, “Don’t ever ask an intern to develop an application without my approval! I don’t care how\ngood he is!” I was the intern in question.\nMy manager, who was quite bold, remonstrated, “Kevin said he could do it, and I’ve been\nasking you to do it for months. I thought it would be helpful.” Seated behind his desk and irritated red,\nthe senior developer asked me to leave his top-floor office while he continued to berate my manager.\nAs the door shut behind me and I descended to my cubicle, a shouting match ensued. I wondered if I\nwould be fired, but I decided right then and there that I would not give this bully the luxury of firing\nme. A few days later, I left the media company on my own terms, disgusted with what I had\nexperienced.\nAbout a week before this eye-opening meeting, my manager had asked me to create an\napplication to track employee arrivals and departures. She mentioned that she really needed this\napplication and that her boss was dragging his feet on producing it. Naturally I felt obligated to meet\nmy manager’s request. I told her that I could do the program and that it would take a few weeks to\ncomplete. She got excited that I had the technical knowledge to do it. I finished designing and coding\nthe application that weekend and showed it to her the following week. Elated, my manager decided to\nshow my program to the senior developer whom she originally asked to do the application. It was a\nbad idea for her and an awakening for me.\nI woke up with the understanding that it makes no sense for a company to stifle the growth of its\nextraordinary young talent, giving favor to its senior people or a counterproductive protocol. That\nhappens often in corporate environments. This type of culture ultimately leads to a company’s demise\nor mediocrity. Conversely, companies led by young adults typically eschew the idea of special\ntreatment because of seniority. Instead, they focus on merit and the ability to deliver results. For this\nreason, a majority of trailblazing companies with innovative ideas don’t have many employees over\nthe age of thirty and implement a flat organization.\nIt’s not so much a secret anymore, but an expectation: Start-up tech companies prefer to hire\npeople under thirty years old to avoid dealing with outdated and ineffectual norms that give\npreference to older people. For example, when Facebook started, it intentionally avoided hiring\npeople in their late twenties and early thirties. Not until the company began to mature and needed to\nbring in experienced executives did it relax this practice. According to a recent book published about\nFacebook, the average age of the company’s fourteen-hundred-plus employees was thirty-one in\n2010. Similarly, PayPal during its early days had a young staff. In fact, Peter Thiel, the CEO of\nPayPal, was thirty-five at the time the company was sold to eBay. He was an elder member of the\ncompany.\nEntrepreneurs believe that talent trumps seniority. Of course, I don’t condone ageism. I do,\nhowever, advocate building an organization that promotes great results and not people for arbitrary\nreasons. If you want to win the game, don’t bench your best players.\n43) You Are Odd, and It’s OK\nEventually, the nerds and the geeks will have their day.\n—Judd Apatow, film producer, comedy writer\nChances are that when you think of the most successful and wealthy entrepreneurs, you don’t think of a\ngroup of weird people. Instead, you probably think of well-respected and brilliant people who\nexhibit all the admirable qualities of well-rounded, well-adjusted leaders. Ironically, research shows\njust the opposite; entrepreneurs, especially those in technology, are indeed quite odd. In fact, the data\nshow that being odd is the norm.\nA recent survey of entrepreneurs conducted by Julie Login of Cass Business School found that\n35 percent of those surveyed suffered from dyslexia, compared with 10 percent of the population as a\nwhole. One reason for this trend posits that those with dyslexia, a learning disability affecting one’s\nreading and comprehension, tend to delegate tasks to manage their disability. Some of the most\nnotable dyslexics of our time are founders Steve Jobs of Apple, John Chambers of Cisco, and\nRichard Branson of the Virgin Group.\nIn another study, attention-deficit disorder (ADD) is common among entrepreneurs. A recent\narticle in \nThe Economist\n mentioned that “people with ADD are six times more likely than average to\nend up running their own businesses.” Sufferers of ADD are known to be disorganized\nprocrastinators who are unable to focus, all normally bad characteristics. But some entrepreneurs\nwho have the disorder—like Paul Orfalea, founder of Kinko’s—interpret these characteristics as an\nadvantage because people with ADD can be creative in ways that “normal” people would not.\nFurthermore, many entrepreneurs display symptoms of Asperger’s syndrome, which, according\nto the Mayo Clinic, is a “developmental disorder that affects a person’s ability to socialize and\ncommunicate effectively with others.” Some refer to it as a mild form of autism. Asperger’s is\nperhaps the most prevalent among software developers like me who would prefer to send an e-mail\nor instant message to someone sitting next to them in the office rather than to talk to them face to face.\nWe often appear robotic and detached. Mark Zuckerberg, the cofounder of Facebook, is a good\nexample of an entrepreneur who exhibits these traits. In Silicon Valley, several entrepreneurs display\nthe symptoms of Asperger’s syndrome. In fact, it’s cool to act this way. Most people would just call it\nbeing a geek. In the Valley, the social butterflies are considered offbeat.\nIn addition to these disabilities, disorders, and syndromes, entrepreneurs have habits that are just\nplain bizarre. Steve Jobs had perhaps the strangest habits, including use of acid and LSD. In fact, he\nattributed his creativity to his taking LSD. Other CEOs have been said to perform karaoke in drag, to\nhave an obsession with guessing measurements, to ideate underwater, and to wear the same clothing\nevery day.\nIn a strange turn of events, these so-called oddities that are common among prominent\nentrepreneurs are attracting investors. To use a term in computer science, pattern matching has\nbecome quite popular. For instance, if you are looking for the next Facebook and you have to choose\nbetween funding two CEOs of equally great tech companies, one who is jovial and the other who is\nintroverted, you’ll probably go with the introvert. This may seem a bit ridiculous, but it happens more\nand more often.\nSo when it comes to being a successful entrepreneur, it pays to be odd. And besides, when you\nbecome wealthy and successful, people tend to forget how odd you might really be. Regardless,\neveryone wants to be your friend.\n44) People Don’t Only Work for Money\nDo not hire a man who does your work for money, but him who does it for love of it.\n—Henry David Thoreau, author, philosopher\nI had it all wrong. I made a rookie mistake, but fortunately was able to correct it quickly.\nWhen I started my third business, a college magazine, I had no knowledge of the publishing\nindustry. I just knew that several major companies were willing to pay me as much as $6,000 for a\nfull-page advertisement. It only cost me about $2,600 to produce the magazine. I planned to allocate\nabout sixteen pages in the first issue to ads. I did the math and determined that with profit margins so\npotentially high, I would learn while on the job.\nNeither did I know about the huge amount of work needed to produce a high-quality magazine.\nThinking that the magazine could be published rather quickly, I set a launch date for one month after I\ndecided to go into the publishing business and announced the date to the public. The month leading up\nto the official launch was one of the most stressful times I can remember. My small team and I worked\nhard.\nTo make a long story short, the magazine launched on time, and it was a huge success with\nreaders. It was a great feeling to walk around campus and see students reading my magazine by the\nthousands. However, the huge profits I estimated before launch didn’t materialize immediately. It took\na few years for that to happen. The profits were low because my payroll was too high.\nWhen I started the magazine, I thought that paying my staff was the honorable and logical thing to\ndo, as if I were a fully developed enterprise. I didn’t expect the students to work for free. Why should\nthey? I assumed that they would work with me because they would appreciate the extra spending\nmoney. I was wrong.\nAs the magazine grew in popularity, we had more writers inquiring about positions. I had\nreached my budgetary limit but decided to let some writers work for free. Ironically, the writers who\nworked for free were often better than those we paid. It didn’t take long for me to make an adjustment.\nI eventually learned that the student writers didn’t care about money. They had enough spending\nmoney from Mom and Dad. Instead, they wanted the experience, college credit, and most importantly,\ncollege clout. As writers for the hottest publication on campus, they instantly became influencers.\nThis influence was especially appealing to underclassmen.\nBefore long, I wasn’t negotiating or even mentioning payment with writers anymore. Instead, I\nwas negotiating perks like backstage passes to concerts, class credit, a chance to interview Janet\nJackson, a trip to MTV’s Spring Break, or a stellar job recommendation. I leveraged the magazine\nand the many perks that came with it to recruit top talent.\nThrough this experience I learned that people are willing to work for things other than money. In\nfact, some people actually work harder when they don’t get paid. If you can find what makes them tick\nor align your goals with their passions, you place yourself in a perfect position to draft them and keep\nthem on your team. I mistakenly believed that because I was young and inexperienced, there was\nnothing I could offer them of value other than money. I was dead wrong and literally paid a price for\nit.\nBefore determining what you will pay people for their services, stop and think about what you\ncan offer them instead of monetary compensation. Chances are you have something that they want, and\nyou can use that as leverage.\n45) You Have a Sidekick\nTwo heads are better than one.\n—John Heywood, English playwright\nOne of my favorite events in the Summer Olympic Games is the 4×100 meter relay. In this event, a\nteam runs 400 meters total, once around a regulation athletics track, with four teammates running 100\nmeters each. Currently, Jamaica holds the world record time of 36.84 seconds, achieved at the 2012\nLondon Olympics. That Jamaican team included Usain Bolt, the fastest man and perhaps the most\npompous athlete in the world. With teeming swagger and silly showmanship, he smashed the 100-\nmeter dash record with an amazing time of 9.58 seconds in 2009. The three other runners on the\nwinning relay team are world-class, too. The Jamaican team is always a favorite to break a relay\nrecord at the Olympic Games.\nThe 400 meters is another favorite event of mine. However, in this race only one athlete runs\n400 meters, the same distance as the 4×100 meter relay. The world record in the 400 meters is held\nby the great Michael Johnson of the United States. Johnson ran 43.18 seconds in 1999. His record\nstill stands almost thirteen years later. Despite this amazing accomplishment, his time is a huge 6.34\nseconds slower than the 4×100 meter relay record. In track and field sprinting events, that difference\nis an eternity.\nWhat does track and field have to do with entrepreneurship? The comparison of the times of\nthese two races, one run by a single person and the other run by four teammates, perfectly explains\nwhy some companies excel and others lag far behind. The metaphor can even be extended to compare\ntraining regimens, options during injury, and race-day strategies. If you are an entrepreneur doing\neverything by yourself, you are competing against a world-class team of sprinters. Chances are you\nwill be left behind, eating the dust of your competitors.\nYoung entrepreneurs often underestimate the productivity and efficiency of a team. Mesmerized\nby the possibility of making a lot of money, they believe that team members or cofounders would\ndilute their equity. This may be true, but the unfortunate assumption that usually accompanies this\nthinking is that the results would be the same—that a person working alone can produce as much as a\nteam. That is unlikely with the right partners, and we all know that it is wiser to have 50 percent\nequity in a large company than 100 percent equity in a small company. Also, many young\nentrepreneurs prefer to avoid the dynamics and complications that come with having team members or\ncofounders. The value of adding another person to your team, however, supersedes these perceived\nhindrances.\nOver the last twelve years of being an entrepreneur, I have seen such selfish and self-defeating\nattitudes cripple many founders. So many companies with great ideas are straggling along or dying out\nbecause of their founder’s unwillingness to collaborate. These self-absorbed leaders are comfortable\nwith coming in last place, a whopping “6.14 seconds” behind the winning team.\nLooking at the greatest start-ups in history, you almost always see a teammate or cofounder from\nthe beginning. Consider Google (Sergey Brin and Larry Page), Microsoft (Bill Gates and Paul Allen),\nApple (Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak), and Facebook (Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin).\nThese pioneers got it right. They realized that their chances of accomplishing their goals were greatly\nenhanced by the contributions of their teammate.\nMy most successful ventures have always been those in which I had great teammates. While\ncreating one of the first online content management systems, OmniPublisher, my partner and I worked\ntogether like the parts of a new jet engine. Once he joined the project, productivity increased fourfold.\nAlso, he brought a different and brilliant perspective to the table about business decisions and\nsoftware production. His involvement also made the experience so much more fun.\nThe idea of one person running a race against four others seems a bit ridiculous, but so many\nentrepreneurs do exactly that. For whatever reason—pride, fear, or greed—they think they can win by\nthemselves. Avoid this trap. If you don’t have a team member or a cofounder, search for one. It may\ntake some time and effort to find the right people, but once you do, you increase your chances for\nsuccess greatly.\n46) Don’t Let People Abuse Your Flexibility\nWork is hard. Distractions are plentiful. And time is short.\n—Adam Hochschild, author, journalist\nBeing an entrepreneur is great, but it has its downside, too. One of the unfortunate realities that many\nentrepreneurs deal with is people’s tendency to abuse their flexibility. This is especially true for\nentrepreneurs in strong relationships, ranging from friendships to marriages.\nWhat do I mean by “abuse their flexibility”? I’ll give you a recent example. My wife’s car\nneeded some repairs recently, so naturally she asked me to help her facilitate a speedy repair.\nSomething told me that this was going to turn into a long ordeal, because we couldn’t reproduce the\ncar’s problem at the dealership when we arrived. We had to go back and forth between home and the\ndealership to no avail. We finally decided to repair what we and our technician thought would fix the\nproblem. To make a long story short, it took us four days to get the car fixed. In the meantime, I took\nmy wife where she needed to go for work and for leisure. I must admit that after the second day, I\nbecame a bit frustrated because I had important work to do, and if I had a regular 9-to-5 job, my\navailability would have been severely limited. In that case, she would have been forced to respect my\ntime. However, considering that I was not on the clock for anyone, \nmy\n time was flexible.\nDon’t get me wrong. I love being able to help my wife, and I would make a hundred more trips\nto the dealership if I had to, but sometimes I feel like I am being held hostage. In other words, I feel\nlike my flexibility is sometimes abused, like I have to pay the entrepreneur’s flexibility tax.\nFurthermore, there’s the guilt. What a cruel husband I would be if I said to my wife, “You know,\nhoney, I am really sorry, but I am only available after five o’clock today, which means we cannot get\nyour car repaired until the weekend.” This would never pass, especially if I chose to work from home\nat any time during the week. The connubial eye would check in on me from time to time, evaluating\nthe importance of everything I was doing. I dare not get caught on Facebook or Twitter during a quick\nbreak from “important” work.\nWhile this situation is amplified in marriages, it shows up in friendships and other relationships,\ntoo. But regardless of whom the demanding person is, boundaries must be set and respected, even if it\nmeans hurting someone’s feelings.\nHow do you set boundaries? Well, I wish I knew the answer myself. I suppose it differs\ndepending on the strength and relevance of the relationship. Individual idiosyncrasies are certainly a\nfactor, too. I suggest being frank with people who are taking advantage of your flexibility and telling\nthem that you have work that must be done. Perhaps you can work out a deal. For instance, if your\nfriend lets you get your work done, then you’ll buy dinner and a movie. The right deal can make\neveryone happy.\nI know it’s easier said than done, but forcing people to respect your time and flexibility is only\nfair. Otherwise, you will always be on call. People who aren’t entrepreneurs must learn that\nentrepreneurs are flexible because they work hard for that privilege. When that privilege is abused or\nat least not respected, frustration and angst ensue.\n47) Don’t Manage People, Manage Expectations\nHigh expectations are the key to everything.\n—Sam Walton, founder, Walmart\nI am probably one of the worst managers ever. Perhaps I can blame an introverted personality that\nprefers to deal with computers rather than with people. (Computers don’t need motivation or blame\ntheir kids for missing deadlines.) I realized that I had management shortcomings after I started my\ncompany, but this realization didn’t come right away.\nDuring the first three years operating my company, I didn’t have a problem managing people. In\nfact, I don’t even think I managed anyone but myself during that period. Everyone who joined my\ncompany in the first few years didn’t receive any pay. They simply shared the vision for building the\nbest web-based publishing software possible and worked diligently to make this a reality. These\nindividuals, most of whom were technical like me, didn’t need much management. There was an\nunspoken commitment and dedication to a tireless work ethic and the high expectations that we\nshared. There was no need to pull out the latest and greatest management software and begin\nmanaging anyone in the traditional sense. We really didn’t have time for all of that, even if we wanted\nto do it.\nHowever, I ran into problems when I began to hire people who weren’t interested in the idea\nand team as much as they were eager to receive a paycheck. Bringing in people who didn’t share the\nsame motivations created a new headache that I wasn’t prepared to endure. For example, I hired a\ngraphic designer who was habitually late and who always had an excuse ready for me. He was much\nolder than I was, so he came with a bevy of excuses that I didn’t know how to handle. He would\nblame his wife, his kids, his jalopy—everything. Until I found the courage to tell him that I didn’t care\nabout those things, I let him get away with missing deadlines and slowing down the team’s\nproduction. It was an especially frustrating time, but soon I had an epiphany.\nI realized that you cannot manage people, only expectations. Conflict often comes from failed\nexpectations. My relationship with the graphic designer was a prime example of this principle.\nInstead of giving the designer clear expectations to meet and communicating the consequences if these\nexpectations were not respected, I treated him like my colleagues who didn’t need what I called\nbabysitting. That had to change.\nConsequently, I put in writing, in painstaking detail, what the company and team required from\nhim. He signed the document. From that point on, if he delivered designs late, I would refer to the\ndocument of expectations that he signed. There was no excuse that trumped the expectations to which\nhe himself agreed. It was a powerful management tool.\nI eventually had to let the graphic designer go. Although he did great work, he rarely met\ndeadlines, and his personality and work ethic didn’t fit the team’s. In fact, he had a negative effect on\nour team’s morale.\nI learned a valuable lesson dealing with him and other unruly employees: Make sure that you\ndon’t try to manage people, because it’s impossible. If you try to do that, you’ll drive yourself crazy.\nInstead, define and manage expectations of individuals who work with you or for you. Clearly setting\nexpectations in the beginning of the relationship and holding people to them avoids confusion and\nmisunderstanding later. If you do this, you are on your way to becoming a much better manager than I\nwas when I started my company.\n48) Get the Right Mentor\nEverybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it.\n—Jay-Z, recording artist, entrepreneur\nSince I started my business, I have been fortunate to have excellent mentors who have helped me to\ngrow as an entrepreneur. In fact, not only have they been great advisers, but they have also brought me\nvaluable clients. Without their counsel and referrals, I certainly would have made many more\nmistakes and had fewer clients.\nThe need for and benefits of mentors are well understood. I won’t belabor the point. However,\nwhat’s not so obvious is the type of mentors you should have and how often you should use them.\nWhen you choose a mentor, be sure that the mentor has attained the level of success that you\nwish to reach. Align yourself with mentors who not only understand where you want to go but who\nalso have been there. If you don’t have at least one mentor who fits this role, you run the risk of\nreceiving advice that actually stunts your growth or inhibits your vision. Often, a mentor’s advice is\nlimited by that person’s experiences. For example, if you need to raise money via an angel investor or\na venture capitalist, having a mentor who has been through this experience increases your chances of\na successful capital campaign. Likewise, if your company has the potential to go public, you must\nhave an adviser who understands what it takes to go through an initial public offering. An\ninexperienced mentor in these areas, even with the best intentions, may advocate that you bootstrap\nyour company and avoid IPO dreams. Assuming that your company has blue-chip potential, this\nadvice would be a disservice to your company.\nAlso, many entrepreneurs don’t use their mentors enough. Whether entrepreneurs fear being a\npest or don’t understand the value of an additional opinion, they only use their mentors once in a\nwhile. But if you are working diligently on your business, you should be in constant contact with your\nmentor. Consult with your mentor on at least a monthly basis. I frequently shoot my mentor an e-mail\nabout an issue or ask him if I can call and get his opinion on something. I promise him that the\nconversation will take no more than five or ten minutes, and I do my best to stick to that time limit. If I\ngo over, I ask for permission to continue. I want to be respectful of his time and willingness to help\nme.\nMany entrepreneurs have quarterly advisory board meetings. That’s fine, but they should not take\nthe place of a more personal and impromptu relationship. Boards are important, but I recommend that\nyou have at least one mentor who is on call and who can answer your questions on the day that you\nask them.\nNo entrepreneur has succeeded without some type of mentor figure. Mentors are invaluable.\nMake sure that the one you choose has achieved what you want and that you consult that mentor\nfrequently. If your mentor is not accomplished enough or is inaccessible, find someone else who can\nreally help you move closer to achieving your goals.\n49) Choose Your Spouse Wisely\nThe most important career choice you’ll make is who you marry.\n—Sheryl Sandberg, COO, Facebook\nAs I watched my life play out on the big screen in the movie \nThe Social Network\n, I smiled,\nreminiscing about my college days when I, too, was an instant campus superstar like Mark\nZuckerberg, cofounder of Facebook. It was a defining moment in my life.\nJust like Zuckerberg in the movie, I was a geeky computer science major with a handful of\nbrainiac friends; then suddenly I was “the man” with more friends than I could have ever imagined. I\nhad created a popular, online community for college students, complete with a dynamic book\nexchange, a dating service, chat rooms, news, photo galleries, and other neat features. Naturally, with\nmy newfound fame came the groupies, the women who didn’t necessarily have an interest in me as\nmuch as my ability to rub elbows with moguls like P. Diddy and Kanye West.\nBefore long, I had my first serious girlfriend, a very demanding one who didn’t take no for an\nanswer. (Recall Eduardo’s crazy girlfriend in the movie.) She didn’t understand that I was a geek and\nthat there was nothing more satisfying to me than coding a brilliant new feature for my website. In\nother words, she couldn’t accept that she was a distant number three at best, just after PHP and\nmySQL (computer programming languages).\nOne night I knew things were going south—and fast. The hour was late. I was in my room\nworking on the computer and in walked my girlfriend. She seductively sprawled on the edge of the\nbed, naked except for high heels and nylons. I barely noticed. She erupted with fury, screaming, “I\ndon’t need this. I could call some other guys in my black book.” I didn’t respond. I was too busy,\nalready making love to my PC. I had an epiphany that climactic night; I realized just how much ground\nI had lost in building my company.\nFast-forward. She broke up with me. Simply put, she wanted sex, and I wanted success. Of\ncourse, both desires are not mutually exclusive, but the former surely can be a distraction—and in my\ncase, that’s exactly what it was. The fact that my college crush dumped me for being extremely\nfocused was the best thing that happened to me at that moment.\nAfter the breakup, I devoted myself 100 percent to growing my technology and media business. It\npaid off. Within weeks of implementing my monetization plan, I received my first check from a firm\nthat purchased a banner ad for $1,800. Soon after, I partnered with a classmate and computer whiz.\nTogether we created OmniPublisher, one of the first online content management applications. A few\nyears later, I sold it to a publishing company.\nPerhaps this story is a circuitous and somewhat inflated way to prove a basic point, but it is\ncertainly a lesson that all young entrepreneurs must learn: Choose a mate who understands that your\ndrive to succeed at times trumps satisfying their sex drive—among other things. Distractions in the\nform of bad or draining relationships have wrecked so many businesses. In fact, many venture\ncapitalists devalue a company’s worth based on the increased risk that married cofounders present.\nWhen choosing a mate, make sure that person is an asset, not a liability.\nEpilogue: Last time I heard, my ex isn’t doing so well. But things have turned out pretty well for\nme, as it relates to success and . . . you know. I married an awesome woman who loves my\nentrepreneurial focus and encourages me all the time.\n50) Fire Unproductive People\nHire slow, fire fast.\n—Unknown\nI recently received a desperate call for help from one of my mentees, who is working hard to grow\nhis new clothing company. He sought advice about how to deal with a lazy business partner who is\npreventing the company from moving forward. My mentee wrote,\nI have been working on my company for the past few months and things are going OK. I\nhave a friend who I have known since 1996. He is also working on our clothing line. He\nsays that he is interested in combining our ideas and working together. . . . That was almost\na year ago. At the beginning, he was eager and helping a lot. Now, not as much. There\nhasn’t been much communication about what he wants to do. I questioned him last month to\nsee what ideas he had. Basically, he just said that he is still thinking about ideas, but he’s\nbroke. I don’t have much money either, but I have gotten shirts printed and ready to sell. At\nthis point, I’m lost. It’s like he says one thing and does something else. What do you think I\nshould do? Should I try to work it out by myself or should I cut ties and find a business\npartner who is not a friend, but who is serious about things?\nAs soon as I finished reading his e-mail, I replied, “It sounds like you’ve already made a decision, a\nright decision. You don’t have time to wait. Find someone who is on top of their game.” I hope he\ntakes my advice.\nMy mentee faced a common challenge for entrepreneurs: finding and keeping the best talent to\naccomplish their business goals. Other than financial problems, this challenge is probably the most\nnerve-wracking part of growing a business, especially if you have few resources to attract and\ncompensate workers. Regardless of the situation, great entrepreneurs find the right people to make\ntheir dreams happen.\nThere are two types of entrepreneurs when it comes to finding talent.\nOne type of entrepreneur is weak and indecisive on personnel decisions. Such a person is\ndesperate to find a business partner, contractor, or employee, accepting practically anyone without\nthe proper due diligence. Lacking the patience or knowledge to screen people, this type of\nentrepreneur is quick to enlist a friend or acquaintance and slow to fully assess a prospect’s worth. A\nperson whose performance is poor or hurting the business receives multiple second chances. Finally,\nthe entrepreneur is too scared to pull the trigger and perhaps fire the least productive people on the\nteam. The firing comes eventually, after valuable time and resources have been wasted.\nThe other type of entrepreneur is strong and resolved, ruthless in pursuit of good people and\ncommitted to finding good team members. There’s no rush to judgment about prospects; those who\neventually join the team are the best people for the job. Decisions come without emotion, and\nnepotism is never an option. Poor performers rarely get second chances. This type of entrepreneur\nreaches goals more quickly because of thorough, wise, and fair personnel decisions. Every\nentrepreneur should follow this model.\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about forming a team or hiring employees is that once you\nfind great people, your personnel problems are solved and that everyone will constitute a tight and\neffective unit for years to come. Business rarely works out that way, especially for young companies.\nFor reasons ranging from poor performance to recruitment by other companies, you can expect to lose\npeople. Because attrition is inevitable, entrepreneurs and leaders of small companies must be\ncommitted to \nalways\n looking for good talent.\nAccept only the best people for your business. If you are most efficient in your search for talent,\neven the lesser candidates you consider will be above average. As a result, your company will grow\nfaster and last longer.\nChapter 4\nFinance\nMoney isn’t the most important thing in life, but it’s reasonably\nclose to oxygen on the “gotta have it” scale.\n—Zig Ziglar, author, motivational speaker\nThough it sounds obvious, this basic idea must be emphasized from time to time: You are in\nbusiness to make money. Caught up in the throes of everyday business activities, ranging from selling\nto managing operations, entrepreneurs often leave matters of finance to fall by the wayside. By the\ntime they realize the importance of closely monitoring their finances, it is too late; the damage has\nbeen done.\nThis chapter presents different ways to stay on top of your personal and business finances to\navoid problems. Moreover, you’ll find advice on how to secure investment funds for your company.\nYou don’t have to become a guru of cash flow analyses and balance sheets, but you do need to\nunderstand some basic concepts.\n51) You Don’t Need Money to Make Money\nMoney won’t create success, the freedom to make it will.\n—Nelson Mandela, former president, South Africa\nNothing is more irritating than hearing one of the many generalizations that permeate the business\nworld and corrupt the minds of new entrepreneurs. You’ve heard them. You may even deal in these\nfalse aphorisms: “Follow your passion.” “Fake it ’til you make it.” “Entrepreneurs are born, not\nmade.” However, perhaps the most damaging to new entrepreneurs is the following: “It takes money\nto make money.” No statement is more wrong or misleading.\nI vividly remember when, where, and from whom I first heard this phrase. I was barely in my\ntwenties and in downtown Atlanta, meeting with an accomplished entrepreneur who owned her own\ngraphic design studio. I don’t remember the context of our conversation, but when she said those six\nwords I was perplexed. I was more impressed with the phrasing itself than its validity. At that point, I\nhad started my first three companies with hardly any money at all. What she said just didn’t make\nsense and certainly wasn’t applicable to me.\nMy first company, a website for college students, didn’t require much money at all. If anything, it\ndemanded only my time and computer programming skills. During the first few years of the business, I\nonly spent money on web hosting and a domain name, although it certainly wasn’t necessary. Those\ncosts were about $30 monthly. My second company, which produced a web-based content\nmanagement system, had similar, nominal costs. Finally, my third company, a magazine, didn’t require\nmoney at all. I simply came up with the idea and went out to sell it before it existed. For each\nbusiness, I assumed that raising money was not even an option, and I am glad that I did. Had I heard\nthat awful phrase, I may have delayed or killed my ventures, thinking that I had to raise money.\nInstead, I figured it out and, most importantly, attacked my goal with the resources I had.\nHaving access to start-up capital when you don’t need it can actually stunt your growth. What is\nintended to help can turn out to be quite harmful. For instance, you can burn through cash\nunnecessarily, buying products and services that you could otherwise figure out how to obtain free of\ncharge. That money could be used to purchase more important things. I cringe when I see a young\nentrepreneur’s start-up costs include items like office supplies and computers when they are\nabsolutely unnecessary. These individuals don’t have the right state of mind of seeking to save money\nwhenever possible. Perhaps they heard and were influenced by the very phrase that I am attempting to\nrefute.\nNow that I have been in business for over a decade, I think the phrase—altered a little bit—can\nbe applied to specific situations. I would rephrase it this way: “It often takes money to make a whole\nlot of money.” As I raise money for my next start-up, the reality of this interpretation is all too real.\nWhen you aim to execute a big idea fast, an infusion of cash is necessary in many cases. To illustrate,\nmost people would agree that the idea of starting a nuclear power plant with no money is ludicrous. In\nthis case, before you have actual revenue, you would have to spend a significant amount of money.\nRegardless, most entrepreneurs do not raise capital to start their business.\nDon’t believe the hype about needing money to start a business. It’s deceiving, and if you\nbelieve it, you could be ruining or delaying the success of your own endeavor. People who repeat\nsuch generalizations are sometimes simply trying to sound wise and learned, or they are trying to\njustify why they are broke.\nHaving no money doesn’t mean you have no resources. You’ve got something, so get started on\nyour new business—and without spending any money if you can.\n52) Pay Taxes Quarterly\nYou don’t pay taxes. They take taxes.\n—Chris Rock, comedian, actor\nI was anxious out of my wits as I sat in my chair waiting for the calculations to tabulate. I had dreaded\nthis day ever since the previous January, when I knew I had only three months left until the deadline.\nOn that early March day, my accountant hit the enter button on his keyboard with an accented motion\nand said nonchalantly without even looking at me, “You owe . . . ” I heard the astronomical number\nthat followed, but it didn’t register as reality. I panicked inside, trying not to blurt out an expletive\nand bring unwanted attention to myself. What I had feared was actually happening. I owed the\ngovernment more taxes than I could pay.\nWhen I started my company, the only thing I knew about business taxes was that I had an EIN\n(Employee Identification Number) needed to open a bank account and that I would eventually have to\npay corporate taxes. I had no idea how to plan for what I would need to pay annually in taxes, and\nfrankly that was the last thing on my mind. I was more concerned with perfecting my product and\ntrying to sell it. Likewise, when I started to make significant money, tax planning was not a priority.\nBecause of my negligence, I ended up spending almost everything my company made to grow the\nbusiness and to pay salaries. It was a novice mistake that I would literally pay for later.\nIf I could go back in time to give myself advice, I would have suggested that I search online\n(remember Altavista and Webcrawler?) for basic accounting information on corporate tax planning. I\nwould have also advised myself to find an accountant who specialized in helping new businesses\nprepare for their impending tax obligations. Following this basic advice would have saved me the\nparalyzing stress of finding out that I was in over my head on tax day. Only a teenager when I started\nmy company, I was terrified of what the IRS would do to me if I were delinquent. I thought IRS agents\nwould arrest me, seize my possessions, and fine me at least $100 each day I was late paying them the\nmoney I owed.\nNow that I am wiser and have an accountant who does more than crunch numbers for me before\nthe annual corporate tax deadline of March 15, I have a plan to pay estimated taxes for my S\ncorporation. Estimated taxes are based on your expected adjusted gross income, deductions, credits,\nand so on. According to the IRS website, “If you are filing as a sole proprietor, partner, S corporation\nshareholder, and/or a self-employed individual, you generally have to make estimated tax payments if\nyou expect to owe tax of $1,000 or more when you file your return.” Those who opt to pay estimated\ntaxes are required by the IRS to pay them quarterly. Following this method helps taxpayers avoid the\nsticker shock that I experienced the first time I owed the government a lot of money for taxes.\nAfter receiving the bad news from my accountant years ago, I summoned my entrepreneurial\ncreativity to figure out how I could earn money quickly to pay the tax bill. I came up with a plan and\nwas able to pay what I owed on time. I learned my lesson well, and apparently I am not the only one.\nOver the years, I have heard similar stories from other entrepreneurial tyros. If you are just starting a\ncompany or already have one, don’t be like us. Make sure that you pay estimated taxes quarterly to\navoid being chopped by the tax ax.\n53) A Check in Hand Means Nothing\nHonesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty.\n—Plato, Greek philosopher\nIf I had listened to my intuition, I could have saved myself some trouble. I would have heeded the\nmany clues that the shoddy owners of the mom-and-pop business gave me. I would have run out of\ntheir dubious restaurant as fast as I could and never come back.\nInstead, I ignored my intuition and accepted the restaurant’s order to place an advertisement in\nmy magazine. I told the owners, a wife-and-husband team, that our next issue was going to press soon\nand that they would see a quick return on their investment. I prepared the order, took their check, and\nran their full-page, color ad.\nThe adventure and hard lesson began a few days later when I checked my bank account, which\nwas off by $321, the exact amount I had charged the restaurant for its ad. After a closer look at my\naccount’s recent transactions, I noticed that the customer’s check had bounced. Sure enough, a few\ndays after that, I received the restaurant’s rubber check in the mail with the damning NSF\n(nonsufficient funds) stamp, and my bank had charged me severe penalties for it. It was the first\nbounced check that I had ever received in my life, and I wasn’t happy about it.\nA completely naïve, young entrepreneur, I assumed that everyone who wrote a check had money\nin the bank to cover the amount. Apparently, I came from Pleasantville, the imaginary place where\neverything is perfect and everyone’s word, or check in this case, is bond. The business world is\nnowhere near the utopian Pleasantville. No, there will always be people in business who try to take\nadvantage of you, and that’s exactly what these rogue restaurant owners did.\nI shared my experience and frustration with my mentor. I told him that I wasn’t so upset about the\ncheck bouncing as much as the owners probably knowing that they wrote a bad check. In his\nnonchalant tone, he admonished me, saying, “Simple solution: If you suspect that someone has given\nyou a bad check, take that check to the bank written on the check and ask if there are sufficient funds\nin the account. A bank teller will tell you that information. If there is, you can cash the check right then\nand there.” I was surprised to learn this. His solution would totally eliminate the risk associated with\nsubmitting a questionable check to my bank, which would charge me if the check was indeed bad.\nFrom that point on, I did just that for suspicious customers, and it has saved me similar trouble. I also\nlearned that it is against the law to write bad checks.\nI don’t recall if I ever got my $321. I think I did after going to the customer’s bank repeatedly\nuntil the funds were available. Regardless, I learned a valuable lesson that shapes my company’s\npolicy to this day: A check in hand means nothing. In other words, don’t count your money until it’s in\nthe bank—and in there for a while.\nWhen you receive a new purchase order, a check, a verbal agreement, or a written agreement\nfrom a customer wanting to buy your product or service, don’t get too happy and excited. Save the\ncelebration until you have cold cash in hand or the funds are verified.\n54) Avoid Negative Cash Flow\nTo become successful you must learn how to manage cash flow.\n—Robert T. Kiyosaki, author, \nRich Dad, Poor Dad\nI had no idea when I entered the media business that it was, as my mentor put it, “the easiest business\nto get into, but the hardest to stay in.” After a few months into my venture, I learned the hard way\nexactly what he meant.\nMy challenge was cash flow. So many start-up businesses struggle with understanding and\nmanaging cash flow, which is simply a measure of a company’s financial health. It equals cash\nreceipts minus cash payments over a given period of time. Bad cash flow management is one of the\nmain reasons start-ups go out of business in their first year, even if they are profitable. How does this\nhappen? First let’s look at an example dealing with personal expenses.\nMany people manage cash flow every month as they struggle to pay bills and hope that they have\nmoney left over to save, buy a new car, or go on a nice vacation. If you have a job, you may know the\nfeeling of having lots of bills that are due and anticipating payment from your employer so that you\ncan pay those bills. At that moment in time, when you have bills due that same day and a payday two\nweeks away, you have a negative cash flow position. The reverse situation, when you have more\nmoney available than bills due that same day, is a positive cash flow position.\nBusinesses also struggle with managing cash flow. During the first year of publishing my\nmagazine, enough advertising was sold to cover costs. We encouraged and incentivized prepayment\nfor advertisements so that we could use that money to pay for printing, distribution, and other costs,\nbut not all buyers were able to pay upfront. We extended some customers credit, giving them thirty\ndays to pay us in full. When it was time to pay for our operating expenses, we had barely enough\nmoney to do so. Those customers to whom we extended credit normally paid in ninety days instead of\nthirty. We were profitable on paper, but could never quite get ahead of money going out the door to\nsustain operations. I was eventually able to get ahead, but doing so was difficult, especially since I\nhad less available credit than I needed to float my operation while we collected receivables. Despite\novercoming this problem, sometimes I felt like the end was near—such as when I had to print a new\nissue but still hadn’t received money from advertisers in previous issues. It was not a good feeling at\nall.\nNegative cash flow is not a bad thing per se. In fact, it is necessary for many businesses in\nnumerous industries, particularly if the business is in the start-up phase. However, maintaining a\nnegative cash flow position for too long is detrimental to any business. Your goal as leader should be\nto find out what the norms are for your industry and what is healthy. A financial adviser can also help\nyou understand your options so that you can avoid this financial stumbling block.\nYour company can be profitable but headed out of business, leaving you with a heap of debt and\na feeling of despair. It happens every day to promising but poorly managed companies. For your\nbusiness, ensure that you not only do monthly income statements but also monthly cash flow\nstatements. As a result, you will better understand how to avoid a devastating, negative cash flow\nposition, whether by decreasing expenses, tightening your sales cycle, or receiving a cash infusion.\nUltimately, you can avoid a rude awakening and some start-up frustration.\n55) Borrow Money from a Bank before You Need It\nA bank is a place that will lend you money if you can prove that you don’t need it.\n—Bob Hope, comedian, actor\nWhen Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in fall 2008 signaling the start of the Great Recession, I\nhad a clear premonition that things were going to get bad really fast.\nThe announcement of the collapse was especially untimely for me. During the same period that\nthe investment bank’s epic failure made national news, my wife and I were married. To remember our\njoyous union, we saved the newspaper from that beautiful fall day. The headline of the \nAtlanta\nJournal-Constitution\n read, “U.S. Tries Hands-On Bank Fix.” The article stated, “The United States\nand the globe’s other industrial powers pledged to take ‘decisive action and use all available tools’\nto prevent a worldwide economic catastrophe.” It was yet another harbinger of economic calamity,\nthe proportions of which had not been seen since the Great Depression. I told my wife, “If the\neconomy collapses, at least we have each other, honey!”\nLikewise, the timing couldn’t have been worse for my business. Almost immediately, the\nbusiness environment deteriorated. Companies began to go into survival mode. Many of my best\nclients called to cancel orders. Companies that I had long-term relationships with severed ties. New\nprospects showed no interest in buying. Financial experts warned of the impending credit crunch. My\ncompany’s cash flow position was getting worse everyday. I couldn’t stand around and watch my\ncompany slowly die. I was desperate to save it, so I decided to explore all options, including getting\na loan from a major bank.\nNot expecting much, I consulted with one of my trusted bankers at Washington Mutual. She told\nme that I had no good options. Considering the recession and my poor cash position, no financial\nproduct available could help my company. She added that few businesses were receiving financing at\nthe time. Hardly any credit lines were being extended. Likewise, hardly any installment loans were\nissued. The bank was open, but really it was closed.\nWith no reasonable options, I sourly remembered what an experienced banker had told me years\nbefore: “Borrow money from a bank before you need it.” It made sense when I had heard his words,\nbut I never followed his advice. I had waited too long, and here I was hoping that a bank would save\nmy company when ironically the bank needed saving itself. (Washington Mutual was acquired by\nChase a few months later.) Instead of relying on a cash infusion from a bank to help my company\nweather the economic storm, my team and I would have to survive the old-fashioned way by hitting\nthe pavement and working harder than ever. I learned my lesson.\nBanks prefer to lend to businesses that already have money and show signs of good financial\nhealth. Why? These businesses are most likely to pay back loans and thus are a low risk. On the other\nhand, distressed companies are a high risk and won’t find many conventional loan products at a major\nbank. They must seek alternative financing that invariably carries higher interest rates. Sounds\ncounterintuitive, but banks and many other lending institutions operate this way. In another example of\nreverse logic, few people know that banks consider deposits liabilities, not assets.\nWhen your company is experiencing high growth and increased revenues, strengthen your capital\nstructure. For example, apply for additional credit lines or request an extension of your current lines.\nMoreover, apply for an installment loan if appropriate to fuel more growth. Also, raise money from\ninvestors. As the economy shows small signs of recovery, banks are promoting new products and\nbeginning to take greater risks. Take advantage of these opportunities.\nEntrepreneurs must be mindful that recessions and economic downturns are inevitable. If you are\nin business long enough, you will experience one. Preparing your company to weather these storms is\npart of your job. One of the best ways to do this is to secure your company’s financial welfare by\napplying for and receiving credit when you don’t need it. If you wait until you need it, you could have\nthe same fate as Lehman Brothers.\n56) Prepayment Is King; Disregard Standard Payment Terms\nLack of money is the root of all evil.\n—George Bernard Shaw, Irish playwright; cofounder, London School of Economics\nRecent court documents reveal the cofounder of Facebook’s frustration with a client who failed to\npay him for his computer programming services in 2004. At the time, Mark Zuckerberg was still a\ncomputer science major at Harvard. He wrote in January 2004, “I contracted out my services for\nmoney, and even though I seem to continually be providing services, I don’t seem to be receiving\nmoney from you guys.” The client was a man named Paul Ceglia. Ceglia later replied in February, “I\nwill do my best to try to raise the cash needed to pay the amount requested though I honestly cannot\nguarantee it.” When this reply was sent, Ceglia owed Zuckerberg $10,000. Thefacebook was founded\nduring the same month that these last e-mails were exchanged. In 2011, Ceglia sued Zuckerberg for a\n50 percent stake in Facebook, claiming that Zuckerberg stole his idea. Ceglia eventually withdrew his\ncase.\nWhile some reports on this frivolous case focus on Zuckerberg’s frustration, I immediately\nthought something different: \nWhy was Zuckerberg doing work for a client and not getting paid?\nIsn’t this guy supposed to be really smart?\n I was perplexed. Then I recalled that he nearly sold a\ncompany to Microsoft in high school for about $1 million. Perhaps he thought the risk of not being\npaid was low, and if the client didn’t pay, he wouldn’t be out of much money, time, or effort. I tried to\nrationalize his response. I ultimately concluded, knowing from experience, that regardless of what \nhe\nthought then, it’s never a good idea to do work with questionable payment arrangements or to continue\nwork with a delinquent client.\nNew entrepreneurs often do work for clients who take advantage of them. I was one of them. I\nremember vividly how I dealt with my first rogue client. Whereas Zuckerberg was twenty years old\nduring his dispute with Ceglia, I was twenty-two when I had my dispute with a customer. I created\nsoftware for a client who was using it but not paying. I decided to sue him in small claims court. The\nentire experience was a bit scary. Nevertheless, I went to the courthouse in downtown Atlanta and\nfiled my papers for about $75. The client, who wasn’t that much older than me, ended up paying me\nthe full amount he owed. Accompanied by his father, he brought cash and paid me in the hall just\nbefore our case was called. We informed the clerk that we had resolved the matter, and the case was\nclosed.\nSince that experience, I have learned and adopted several strategies to ensure faster payment.\n1. \nBuild trust immediately.\n During the selling or price negotiation process, work hard to build\ntrust so that you can ask for and receive prepayment for services or a product. Give references before\nthe client asks for them. Also, ensure that your brands and work are presented in the most\nprofessional manner, so that the client feels comfortable paying upfront.\n2. \nBe clear with your payment terms.\n Make sure that terms are well-defined for both sides from\nthe very beginning—and in writing. Always present a clear and concise policy for payment terms, so\nthat the client knows exactly what to expect and what you expect.\n3. \nBe aggressive with your timeline.\n Ask for prepayment first, and then consider longer payment\nperiods if necessary. Do whatever it takes to get paid on time. Don’t be afraid to ask for what you\nwant. Pick up the check in person, if you have to. In a perfect world, there is no such thing as net thirty\ndays. I prefer net now.\nThe nature of business is that buyers want to pay as late as possible, and sellers want to be paid\nas early as possible. Your goal as an entrepreneur is to maintain good cash flow, and the best way to\ndo that is to receive your money as soon as possible. You must be confident and direct about when\nyou expect to be paid. Yes, it can be awkward and uncomfortable at times, but take it from\nZuckerberg and me: it sure beats not being paid at all or having to go to court.\n57) Hiring a Professional Accountant Is Money Well Spent\nI have no use for bodyguards, but I have very specific use for two highly trained certified public accountants.\n—Elvis Presley, singer, actor\nBefore I knew better, accountants were about as fun to visit as dentists. In fact, if you had asked me\nwhether I wanted a dentist to fill my cavity or an accountant to do my tax return, I probably would\nhave chosen dental work. My reasoning: Although the dentist would inflict more physical pain, at\nleast his services would be cheaper than the accountant’s. I was naïve and young then. Now I would\nmost certainly prefer to visit my accountant.\nWhen starting out, most entrepreneurs do everything they can to cut corners. That’s\nunderstandable, because resources are low. They serve as the CEO, director of marketing, director of\nsales, mailroom clerk, custodian, and accountant all in one. During the early stages of a venture, no\none wants to be wasteful, so the more tasks an entrepreneur assumes, the more money is saved—or so\nthe thinking goes. This misconception, though, will not only drive you nuts to the point of burnout, but\nit will also cost you. Contrary to what Intuit would like you to believe, you don’t save money keeping\nyour own books. It’s not worth the headache to be your own accountant.\nDuring my first year as an entrepreneur, I quickly decided that trying to figure out how to be an\naccountant was not worth my time. I drove to the closest H&R Block and asked for help. An older\ngentleman, who reminded me of Arnold Palmer, helped me get on the right track. He was pricey, but I\nwas glad to have him crunch numbers and save me the hassle. I stayed with him even when he left\nH&R Block to start his own practice in rural Georgia. I stopped going after the second year, when his\nnew office was located in a dilapidated building, complete with bad wooden paneling, plastic\ndividers between dingy offices, and a questionable gun exchange. It’s probably confabulation, but I\nthink there was even a stuffed bear in the office, too. I had my limits, so I found a new guy who turned\nout to be cheaper and more knowledgeable.\nSince then, I have had the same accountant for almost ten years. He’s great. He does his work\nquickly, reminds me when forms and payments are due, gives me great advice, advocates on my\nbehalf, and is highly accessible. Even better, his office is fairly new, and no dead animals are hanging\nfrom the wall. He saves me tens of thousands of dollars that I’d be wasting because of lack of\nknowledge. If I could convert time to money, that figure would be much higher.\nIf you are still not convinced that you should hire an accountant, ponder these three compelling\nreasons.\n1. \nAccountants save you money.\n The money I spend having a professional accountant crunch\nnumbers for me is much less than the money he saves me. During tax time, for example, I would\nprobably miss some important deductions. America’s tax code is highly complicated, and unless you\nare a professional, you are likely to misunderstand something or totally overlook an opportunity to\nkeep more of your money. Say the accountant recommends a deduction that yields an annual savings\nof $500. Over the next ten years, I would save $5,000 that otherwise I would have paid out.\n2. \nAccountants save you time.\n This is a no-brainer. As CEO of your company, you have better\nthings to do than to reconcile expense sheets and issue 1099s. Your focus should be on growing your\ncompany. An accountant frees you from this burden and reduces your stress.\n3. \nAccountants are not that expensive.\n To continue with our tax scenario, an accountant can\ncharge from $400 to $800 to file a basic annual tax return. If that sounds like a lot, don’t worry. I\nassure you that you will get that money back. Put to the test, any good accountant will pass it.\nAs an entrepreneur, you have to decide what services to pay for, and accounting is one of them.\nAlthough accounting services may seem expensive, especially if you are just starting out, I guarantee\nthat you will save money in the end. From the very beginning, finding a good accountant is a high\npriority. Don’t think of doing business without one.\n58) Manage Debt Well\nRather go to bed without dinner than to rise in debt.\n—Benjamin Franklin, entrepreneur; Founding Father, United States of America\nYears ago, when I was just out of college, I saw an ad in a local Atlanta newspaper that promoted a\nbank’s new business line of credit product. Soon after, I thought I would apply for it. I stopped by the\nbank’s closest branch, filled out the one-page application, and returned it to the banker, not knowing\nwhat to expect. In just a few minutes, the banker hung up the phone and told me the verdict. She\nlooked at me with a big smile and said, “You were approved for $18,000.” Just a few minutes later, I\nwalked out of the bank with a business line of credit for $18,000. Combined with another business\nline and credit cards I received from other banks, I had about $45,000 to fund my next big idea. I was\nexcited and horrified at the same time.\nGrowing up, I learned the importance of managing my personal finances well. My father, who\noften boasted of having “A1” credit, instilled in my siblings and me that a well-managed financial life\nis a good life. He worked in the credit department of a major retail store for decades, so discussing\nmoney and credit in our household was normal. I suppose he was determined to teach his kids how to\navoid the bad financial situations that he witnessed daily at work. Specifically, he taught us to pay our\nbills on time—before the grace period—and to never incur more debt than we can pay back in a\nreasonable time. I never imagined that I would be leveraging credit in the tens of thousands of dollars\nto realize my business dreams. If I had asked my dad, he probably would have discouraged me from\nincurring so much debt at such a young age. It wouldn’t have mattered; I was determined and ready to\nassume the risk. Luckily, my business idea was highly profitable, and I was able to service all debt\nthat I assumed.\nResearch indicates that the great majority of entrepreneurs will never receive money from a\nventure capitalist or an angel investor. Instead, they will fund their businesses with their own money\nand via credit cards. According to a report by the National Federation of Independent Business, in\n2009, 83 percent of businesses with fifty employees or fewer used credit cards. This point is\nimportant, because how you manage your personal finances determines how much money you can\nborrow for your business and at what interest rate. In my case, I received access to $45,000 in large\npart because my father helped me to build a solid credit history from a young age. When I applied for\nthe business lines of credit and credit cards, I received a substantial amount of money at a\ncompetitive interest rate because my personal credit was good.\nHow one manages personal debt is a good indicator of how business debt will be managed. For\nthat reason, banks and other creditors check your personal credit when assessing your\ncreditworthiness for a business loan product. Similarly, I often vet entrepreneurs by learning about\ntheir personal finances. Like the banks, I am less likely to invest in people who can’t manage their\nown finances well, regardless of how great the idea or how large the profit margins.\nOver the years I’ve learned that “debt” is not such a dirty word. You just have to know how to\nuse it. I wasn’t able to change my perspective until I began to conquer my debt. Currently, I have no\ncar note, no student loans, and no credit card debt. Aside from my mortgage, I am debt free. Last time\nI checked, my FICO score was 813, in the top 10 percent. Likewise, my business maintains a healthy\ndebt-to-income ratio, and all of our accounts are in good standing.\nThe best entrepreneurs manage their personal debt well. Also, they find the best money mentors\nor financial gurus to help put them in a position of maximum financial leverage. Undercapitalization\ncontinues to be the main reason so many businesses fail. Considering this, you want to ensure that you\ndo everything you can to maximize your chances of success. Yes, it’s important to have a good idea\nand eventually a profitable business, but following the right financial path to get there is critical, too.\n59) There’s a Downside to Having Investors\nAngel investor funding (venture capital or private for that matter) for your business is a bad idea sometimes.\n—Ryan Mapes, general manager, Go BIG\nIn the world of entrepreneurship, investors are like gods. Why else would the term “angel investor”\nexist? These omnipotent and mystical figures have tremendous power and influence, helping\ndetermine what companies will ultimately join them in the land of milk and honey. However, having\ninvestors is not always a heavenly experience. In fact, having investors can make your life a living\nhell, especially if you make some deadly assumptions about them and their purpose like so many\nentrepreneurs do.\nAs a young entrepreneur I committed this cardinal sin: I assumed that I needed outside investors\nto grow my company. Everything I read about entrepreneurship stressed the importance of having\ninvestors—and at an early stage. According to the books I read, only the most successful businesses\nhad investors. If your idea isn’t funded, then it’s not legitimate or big enough, right? I don’t remember\nmany books discussing the idea of bootstrapping as a real option for a young start-up. If a book did\nmention this option, it provided little or no information on when or how bootstrapping should be\nused. In contrast, most books focused on less pragmatic methods of finding capital that most\nentrepreneurs will never need.\nAs a result of my assumption, I set out to learn everything I could about venture capitalists and\nthe Holy Grail, an IPO (initial public offering). I bought \nHigh-Tech Start-Up\n, a phenomenal book by\nJohn L. Nesheim on creating successful new high-tech companies. The book thoroughly discussed the\nIPO process and the idiosyncrasies of venture capitalists, angel investors, and other types of\ninvestors. I was convinced that my idea was big enough for an IPO, so I studied the book like it was\nmy Bible. I vividly remember studying the equity tables of Microsoft, Apple, DoubleClick, eBay,\nMP3.com, Oracle, and other companies provided in the book’s appendix. I later learned that a great\nmajority of businesses will never reach an IPO, and that according to Saratoga Venture Finance, the\nodds of going public are about six in a million.\nAlthough my initial businesses were not IPO-worthy—far from it—I did eventually create\nfundable ideas that would need outside capital to grow and to scale. As I sought and received funding\nfor some of these ideas, my assumptions about having investors eventually would cause me quite a bit\nof frustration. Three assumptions I had about outside investors are as follows:\n1. \nFinding investors will be easy.\n Overcome by the excitement and conviction of their idea,\nmost entrepreneurs assume that finding investors will be a walk in the park. It is not. I am reminded of\nWalt Disney’s amazing story of perseverance when he sought capital to build his studios. It wasn’t a\nwalk in the “amusement” park for him. Disney was rejected by 302 banks! Most of us would have\ngiven up after the fifth bank’s rejection. Moreover, finding investors isn’t easy because it is energy-\nintensive. A good friend of mine, who recently raised capital for his technology company, was\nalways on the road, meeting with different venture capitalists and angel groups. His travel schedule\nwas grueling, not to mention the constant drilling by brilliant cynics who wanted to put holes in his\nbusiness model. It takes the attitude of a marathoner to find capital for your business: When you want\nto give up, you dig deep to keep going.\n2. \nWhen you receive a yes from an investor, all your money problems will go away.\n Not true.\nIn many ways, your problems may be just starting. Rarely do you hear about investment deals going\nawry, but they often do. After appearing on the popular show \nShark Tank\n, contestant Megan Cummins\nnever received her promised investment of $55,000 for 20 percent equity in her soap company. When\nshe called to get the money, the shark reneged on the deal, asking for 50 percent equity for the same\namount of money. With retailers asking for product, Cummins was put in a bad position. I had a\nsimilar situation in which an investor agreed in writing to fund my company, but pulled out at the last\nminute. I ended up in court to save the project. Also, in a recent Bloomberg television feature about\nTechStars, a business incubator, one company put its investment capital at great risk. One of the\nfounders took money to pay personal financial obligations. The situation was later resolved, but may\nhave been one of the reasons the team eventually split up.\n3. \nBusiness will immediately get better.\n Again, not always true. In many cases, more money and\nresources translate into more problems. If the business plan and model are not sound, throwing more\nmoney at it will yield poor results. To illustrate, it can be like giving more money to a shopaholic.\nThe ideal situation for having investors is when your company is experiencing certified, tremendous\ngrowth, a spurt that is outpacing your current resources. For example, Facebook nearly doubled its\nmembership in 2004 to four hundred thousand. As a result, the company needed servers, so investor\nSean Parker negotiated a deal in which Facebook’s web host company, Western Technology\nInvestment (WTI), gave the company a loan for $300,000. And some of WTI’s executives invested\ntheir own funds in Facebook.\nUnderstanding the downside to having investors in your business will better prepare you for the\nexperience, if you choose to go that route. A capital infusion by an investor can be a huge\naccomplishment and really propel your business to the stratosphere of success, but remember that it\ncan also be pure hell.\n60) Focus on Building Revenue\nMy revenue was $4 million my first year in business, off of one $20 item.\n—Sara Blakely, billionaire, founder of Spanx\nI attended an angel group meeting where my friend presented. His technology company, funded by the\nangel group, gave a brief update on the company’s progress and took questions from the members of\nthe angel group. A few years before this follow-up meeting, his company had received almost a $10\nmillion investment by angels to spur rapid growth. Because of its unique business model and\nunderlying patented technology, the company had tremendous promise, or at least that’s what we\nthought until a candid question prompted an unsettling revelation.\nDuring the five-minute presentation, my friend talked primarily about the impressive amount of\nearned media or free press that the company had received. It was featured in international and\nnational media, ranging from print news to television. In fact, it was featured on a popular late-night\ntelevision show that was a perfect fit for the target consumer it was attempting to reach.\nThe large amount of coverage the company received was great, but I thought it was a bit odd that\nthe presentation was so focused on press coverage and not much else. I became very skeptical about\nthe business’s measurable progress. Apparently, the angels in the room shared my uneasiness. One of\nthe angels addressed the concerns directly during the question and answer part of the presentation:\n“What are your revenues?”\nThere was an eerie silence in the room.\nA normally poised and coherent CEO, my friend hesitated to answer the question. He was a bit\nstunned. His blank facial expression foreshadowed what happened next. After a poor introduction to\nhis answer to mitigate the circumstances, he said sheepishly, “Around $5,000 a month.” After his\nanswer, I looked around the room at the faces of the angels, who are each high-net-worth individuals\nand are veteran investors who have seen it all. They all looked unimpressed as my friend rambled on,\ntrying to draw attention away from the low numbers. Like I did, the angels sensed that the CEO was\nemphasizing the publicity his company received to cloak or to undermine the fact that his revenues\nwere abysmal. I thought to myself that it was only a matter of time before his company went under or\nwas acquired.\nNot even the millions of impressions received from a massive publicity campaign can hide the\nfact that you have poor sales. A company without sales is headed out of business or is really not even\nin business. In general, companies prove their viability through sales and indicate their level of\nsuccess through profit. Technology companies are often an exception to this rule in the short term—as\nthey may build value through increasing their user base, for example—but even these companies must\nshow that they have true value by producing revenue.\nBarbara Corcoran, a real-estate tycoon and angel investor known for her role on the television\nshow \nShark\n \nTank\n said, “No sales equals no value to an investor.” On her hit show, entrepreneurs\nfrequently have the same stunned face that my friend had when investors asked about revenue.\nIronically, the entrepreneurs who have strong pitches proactively declare their revenue while those\nwho have weak pitches timidly hide their revenue. I often find myself talking to the television when I\nwatch \nShark\n \nTank\n, saying, “All of that is great, but what are your sales?” The sharks normally ask the\nsame thing, which emphasizes that entrepreneurs should be focused on building revenue to increase\ntheir chances of an investment. Rarely do angels or venture capitalists invest in companies solely on\nthe attractiveness of an idea.\nThe phrase attributed to champion boxer Joe Louis is quite applicable to business when it comes\nto facing the inevitable matter of revenues: “You can run, but you can’t hide.” The revenue question\nalways finds an entrepreneur, as my friend learned in an embarrassing way. He was running and\ntrying to hide by emphasizing the wide acclaim that his company had received only to be gutted by the\nhumbling revenue question. Investors didn’t fall for his sleight of hand. They knew that publicity\ndoesn’t always translate into sales. It turns out that the angel investors were right on the money,\nliterally. When I came up with the idea for writing this segment, I did a quick search on my friend’s\ncompany. The tech company had just shut its doors and its supporting angel group cut its losses.\nEntrepreneurs who ignore the revenue question only hurt themselves by overlooking the obvious.\nThe best entrepreneurs ask the revenue question every day and focus on building value through sales.\nEverything else is less important.\n61) The Biggest Investment in Your Company Is Yours\nIf I have nothing to sacrifice, I have nothing to gain.\n—Catherine Ndereba, Kenyan marathon runner\nEvery now and then I attend angel investor meetings from which I draw much of my advice for young\nentrepreneurs. Being part of the early-stage, technology investment community affords me an\nexclusive opportunity to assess firsthand the quality of several start-ups.\nIn doing so, I see many of the mistakes that companies make when presenting their companies\nand ideas to angel investors. Criticism given behind closed doors or in personal conversations among\nangels is often more valuable than the feedback given after the official presentation to the body.\nEntrepreneur mistakes range from not preparing thoroughly to not answering a question asked by an\nangel during the dreaded question-and-answer period. Once in a blue moon, I come across a company\nthat makes a mistake regarding its capital structure, giving angels a sound reason to doubt the\ncommitment of the founders or top executives in the company.\nBefore speaking to the body of angels, the person presenting on behalf of the company seeking\nfunds distributes the company’s executive summary. This one- or two-page summary offers vital\ninformation in an easily readable tabular format—information like the business description, problem\nand solution, revenue model, board members, and funds sought. It also includes the company’s current\ninvestment structure, which shows how much money the founders and other investors have put into the\nbusiness.\nIn general, no matter how promising your business may be, investors want to know that you have\nsome skin in the game. How much money you put into a business is a reflection of your own\ncommitment to and belief in the business. Would you invest in a company whose founders have put\nlittle or no money into the company during its early stages? Probably not. You would at least like to\nknow why the founder’s investment is so small. Even if there is a technical founder on the team, for\nexample, who has provided tens of thousands of dollars worth of sweat equity, it’s always a good\nsign that he has also put hard cash into the business.\nFor example, one company presenting at a recent angel meeting I attended had two types of\ninvestors: The founders collectively invested $55,000, and they also had a $45,000 research grant.\nThe company was requesting a six-figure investment. Another company with a more complex\ninvestment structure had six different investors, totaling just under $300,000 in investment capital.\nThe founder alone had invested $200,000. His company was asking for a $500,000 investment to\nscale and to reach projected revenues of almost $8 million by 2015. These two companies are great\nexamples of companies that put their money where their business is.\nIf you are seeking investment capital from an angel or a relative, be sure to quantify in clear\nterms the investment you’ve made in the company. Investors want to see that important information,\nwhich can increase your probability of getting funded. If you are raising money in an unconventional\nway, you may have to quantify your input in an unconventional way. For instance, log the hours\nyou’ve worked on your business and price your labor based on current market conditions. Or add up\nall the expenses you’ve had to pay to get the business to where it is. Do whatever it takes to validate\nyour dedication to the business. A business whose founders are well-vested is a business that’s\nworthier of investment.\n62) Use Different Banks to Minimize Risk\nI have always been afraid of banks.\n—Andrew Jackson, seventh president, United States of America\nOne of the worst things you can do as an entrepreneur is to open a business bank account at a bank\nwhere you have a personal bank account. Likewise, it is not a good idea to open a business credit\ncard at the same bank where you have a personal account. Should you ever have a financial problem\nwith your business bank account or business credit card, your personal accounts will be affected\nnegatively and vice versa.\nEntrepreneurs often set up some or all of their banks accounts with the same bank for what they\nconsider good reasons, but they do so without thinking of or knowing the consequences. For example,\nconvenience is perhaps the most common reason. They prefer to go to the same bank, not several\ndifferent banks, to make multiple transactions. Entrepreneurs are all about being efficient and saving\ntime, but this benefit is nominal. Moreover, many entrepreneurs succumb to the banks’ clever\nmarketing and special offers that give privileges (like reward points or exempted fees) to customers\nwho open multiple accounts. Entrepreneurs are all about saving money, but this, too, is not worth the\nsmall benefit.\nSo what’s the problem? The problem is that banks don’t treat multiple accounts they have linked\nto the same person separately. Regardless of what the accountholder may think or the impression the\nbanks may give, all of your accounts are linked together by your Social Security number and tax\nidentification number. Unfortunately, the common misconception is that business accounts and\npersonal accounts are somehow not connected and treated as separate liabilities. This is not always\nthe case. While this may have been truer in the past, our sluggish economy has caused banks to change\ntheir methods of debt collection and to tighten their terms. Some banks are stricter than others.\nAn alarming but little-known problem is the fact that more business owners are experiencing a\nphenomenon known as \nveil\n \npiercing\n, a term used in corporate law that describes disregard for\ncorporate entities. In other words, business owners who have set up a corporation to avoid personal\nliability are discovering that they can, in fact, be liable for certain debts. Banks and credit card\ncompanies are becoming more aggressive in pursuing debts. In fact, some are pushing the limits of\ntheir contractual abilities by overstepping legal boundaries to intimidate customers. Such coercive\nactions have spawned a deluge of complaints and lawsuits.\nAlso, to better manage risk and prevent losses, banks are more actively using the \nright of offset.\nHaving multiple accounts with a bank makes it much easier for banks to go after debts and faster. For\nexample, through right of offset, a bank can legally seize deposited funds to cover a loan that is in\ndefault. Imagine you missed a $750 loan payment for your business, and unexpectedly that exact\namount is deducted from another bank account. That could spark many problems, costing you\noverdraft fees and one big headache. It happens frequently. What makes the matter trickier is that\ndifferent states and different types of banks follow different right of offset laws.\nIn another disconcerting trend, business owners are beginning to see business credit card debts\nshow up on their personal credit reports. Discover, for instance, has openly admitted to reporting\nbusiness debts for placement on personal credit reports. Likewise, CapitalOne reports business debt\nof its credit card holders on personal credit reports. Most companies do not do this, but more are\nconsidering the policy. Also, know that if you have a personal credit card and business credit card\nwith American Express, for example, it is monitoring your overall debt, not each account separately.\nUnfortunately, many business owners have been denied personal credit because they were\nunaware that their business credit is now reported to personal credit bureaus. In one horror story, a\nbusiness owner’s business credit card company started to report to personal credit bureaus a few\nweeks before he planned to close on his new home. The company failed to communicate its new\npolicy. As a result, his debt-to-income ratios worsened and his credit score tanked. He was denied a\nmortgage and was crushed.\nIn brief, always open your business bank account or business credit card with a bank that is not\naffiliated with the bank where you conduct important (especially personal) finances. By doing this,\nyou minimize your risk of the bank doing something to jeopardize your financial welfare.\nFurthermore, read your terms for accounts and loans as if your life depended on it, and ask questions\nif you don’t understand. You must have a strategy when opening bank accounts and applying for credit\ncards for your business, because they have a major effect on your financial future. If you don’t take\nthis crucial step, you are headed for disaster.\n63) Know Your PAYDEX Score\nA good reputation is more valuable than money.\n—Publilius Syrus, Latin writer of maxims\nWhile looking at the requirements of a Fortune 100 company’s supply management division, I came\nacross this statement: “Our selection process includes a review of D&B/Dun & Bradstreet (or\ncomparable) reports.” I was reminded of the many business owners I have come across who don’t\nknow what Dun & Bradstreet is and how this company can affect their business.\nI take pride in having a high credit score or FICO score of 813 in the top 10 percent. Likewise,\nmaintaining my business credit is just as important. In the business world, a company does not have a\nFICO score. Instead, it has a PAYDEX score, a rating maintained and calculated by Dun &\nBradstreet. In other words, what the FICO score is to Equifax, the PAYDEX score is to Dun &\nBradstreet.\nAccording to its website, Dun & Bradstreet, or D&B for short, is the world’s leading source of\ncommercial information and insight on businesses. Its global commercial database contains more than\n200 million business records, which provide customers with quality business information and the\nability to make informed decisions. Customers primarily use D&B’s resources to mitigate credit and\nsupplier risk. D&B provides a wide range of business statistics such as liquidity ratios, asset\nmanagement ratios, debt management ratios, and many other benchmarking tools. The most popular\ntool is the PAYDEX score.\nThe PAYDEX score is D&B’s unique dollar-weighted numerical indicator of how a firm paid\nits bills over the past year, based on up to 55 percent trade experiences reported to D&B by various\nvendors. The D&B PAYDEX score ranges from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating better\npayment performance. A score of 75 is roughly equivalent to a FICO score in the low 700s.\nThe D&B website is impressively thorough. You can view a sample of all three types of\nbusiness credit reports with detailed explanations that D&B offers: the Basic Credit Report, the\nStandard Report, and the Premium Credit Report. The cost per report is $59.99, $119, and $159,\nrespectively, as of summer 2012.\nIf you are in business and have requested credit before, chances are that a company has\nrequested your D&B credit report. Many start-ups and small businesses are not even aware that they\nhave a DUNS Number and corresponding credit report. Your creditors or vendors can report payment\nhistory about you, and D&B will assign you a D&B DUNS number. As with personal credit, be\nproactive in making sure that your company credit report is accurate and complete, that you find out\nyour PAYDEX score, and that you learn how to obtain and to maintain the best report and PAYDEX\nscore possible.\nI strongly recommend that you read everything on the D&B website, because it is an essential\nstep toward effectively managing your business credit, which helps to drive down costs and improve\ncash flow—not to mention it could be the determining factor that helps you close a big deal to become\na supplier for a major company.\nChapter 5\nMarketing & Sales\nOn any given Monday I am one sale closer and one idea away from being a millionaire.\n—Larry D. Turner, author, professional speaker\nUndoubtedly, marketing and sales are vital departments that reside at the heart of any business.\nIn fact, many angel investors and venture capitalists agree that nothing is more important than being\nable to market and to sell your product or service. After all, a business with no sales is not much of a\nbusiness at all.\nThis chapter presents useful tools to help develop your market and customer base. Likewise,\nyou’ll find advice for improving your ability to make a sale. Introduced with practical and engaging\nreal-life cases, these suggestions can be implemented immediately and will give you results quickly.\n64) You’re in Sales, Whether You Want to Be or Not\nTimid salesmen have skinny kids.\n—Zig Ziglar, author, motivational speaker\nReality hit us like a Mack truck and stopped us dead in our tracks. Although we reached our goal of\ncreating OmniPublisher, one of the first content management systems built specifically for\nnewspapers and other periodicals, we realized that we forgot to include the most important element in\nour plan to make millions. Like so many other naïve but brilliant computer programmers, we focused\non building the product, not selling it. When the first version of OmniPublisher was complete, we\nlooked at each other and said, “Now what?” You’d expect more from a guy who would go on to write\ncode for Goldman Sachs’s trading division and a guy who was starting his third business, but you’ll\nfind that this is a common scenario among young entrepreneurs.\nEntrepreneurs who start a business without thinking of how their products or services will be\nsold in the marketplace are making a huge mistake. Why?\nFirst, \nthey run a high risk of wasting valuable resources to create a product or service that\nconsumers do not want.\n We are all familiar with huge flops. Some of my favorites and most\negregious include Webvan, a 2001 dotcom, that delivered groceries to your home. The company\nreached almost $1 billion in total investment before it shut down. More recently, Netflix announced\nthat it would be separating its online streaming service and its DVD mail service. Bad idea. Not only\ndid customers reject this, but they also viciously attacked the company for implementing the change.\nThe move cost Netflix 800,000 customers.\nSecond, \nyou are in business to make money.\n That’s the goal. As obvious as it sounds, some\nentrepreneurs forget this until it’s too late. They realize it when they are too much in debt, when they\nhave no operating income, or when they face some other cold-water-in-the-face moment. I remind\nmyself every morning to focus on sales and profits. I think the title of George Cloutier’s book put it\nbest: \nProfits Aren’t Everything, They’re the Only Thing.\nCompanies that focus on sales and customer needs from the very beginning are more likely to be\nbig winners. For instance, without Steve Jobs’s talents in marketing and sales, Apple wouldn’t have\ngrown to be a public company with record sales. Steve Wozniak, who certainly was the technical\nbrain behind the Apple I personal computer, wanted to give away his inventions. Jobs, on the other\nhand, was adamant about selling the Apple I and other products at a premium price. The rest is\nhistory. Similarly, Mark Zuckerberg had Eduardo Saverin, who began selling advertising for\nFacebook in April 2004. These ads included moving companies, T-shirt retailers, and other\ncompanies that sold college-related products and services.\nOf course, there are rare exceptions. For example, Twitter was born out of a brainstorming\nsession in 2006. The project didn’t focus on sales and had no monetization strategy for years. Instead,\nthe company honed in on developing the product and its user base. Also, Pandora took almost ten\nyears to become profitable. These are great success stories, but most of us don’t have the luxury or\nwillingness to wait that long. We must be profitable as soon as possible.\nThe wise entrepreneur makes sales, the lifeline of any business, priority number one. An\nentrepreneur who has no interest in sales finds the best sales experts for the team to ensure the\nbusiness’s success. If you are like me, you sometimes focus too much on how great your product or\nservice is. You assume that because it’s the best thing since sliced bread, everyone will buy it. It\nrarely works that way, and finding out the hard way is too expensive.\nBy the way, if you were wondering, my business partner and I decided that I would market\nOmniPublisher to companies. Our decision was a huge mistake and stunted our growth. With the right\nsales talent and strategy, the value of the company would have been exponentially greater. I\neventually sold the company, but for less than its full potential. It was a hard lesson to learn: If you\nbuild it, they do not necessarily come.\n65) Your Customer Is Your Boss\nThe customer determines at the end of the day who is successful and for what reason.\n—Jerry Harvey, inventor, entrepreneur\nEveryone talks about how entrepreneurship affords you freedom and independence to do what you\nwant. No longer do you have to suffer the rigid and long hours of corporate America. Nor do you\nhave a demanding and an insensitive boss breathing down your neck every minute. In many ways,\nthese things are true. In fact, I am guilty of touting these benefits of entrepreneurship to spur interest in\nothers to start a business. However, entrepreneurs gloss over reality by focusing on such half-truths.\nWhat is reality? The reality is that even if you are an entrepreneur you have a boss: the customer.\nThe idea that entrepreneurs are free of accountability is misguided and delusional. Ultimately, every\nbusiness is accountable for meeting the needs of the customer. I learned this from the very first job I\nhad as a computer programmer for IBM.\nAs a developer at IBM, I witnessed firsthand how some businesses can presumptuously ignore\ncustomer needs and dictate what users want. While working on a popular groupware product, I\nobserved constant battles between product managers who dealt with customers and computer\nprogrammers who rarely, if ever, interacted with customers. On the one hand, product managers\nwould translate feedback from users into product upgrades or changes to appease buyers. On the other\nhand, the developers would focus on creating challenging features that had no real benefits to the\ncustomers. The features may have been neat, but didn’t add much value to the customers’ businesses.\nIn meeting after meeting, the same issues would arise and hot heads would clash. Often the\ndevelopers would win, to the detriment of the ultimate users and IBM itself. The company needed to\nunderstand and focus on the reason the product and company existed. Neglecting the customer is a\nfatal mistake.\nAlthough IBM, a blue-chip company, isn’t representative of the average company, it does serve\nas a great example of how smaller companies and equally presumptuous entrepreneurs ignore their\ncustomers’ input and feedback. Entrepreneurs, especially those who have experienced a degree of\nsuccess, feel ordained to determine what is best for their customers, more than its customers are\nentitled to determine what is best for them. This attitude often manifests itself in the form of poor\ncustomer service or a slump in sales, often leading to a company going out of business.\nEntrepreneurs in the business-to-business space must be especially careful to listen to their\ncustomers. As indicated in my IBM example, companies are less tolerant of features that don’t add\nvalue to their organization. Perhaps this is why you see some major companies still using a non-\nWindows-based POS (Point of Sales) system. Their cash registers may look old to us, but they work\nand are cost-effective for them. As for companies in the business-to-consumer space, consumers are\nmore forgiving and accepting of features that don’t add value in a traditional business sense. For\nthem, the value could be having the latest and greatest thing, or simply having a great experience with\nthe product or service.\nMajor banks in the business-to-consumer space have recently had to deal with the backlash of\ncustomers who were unhappy with new fees for basic checking services. After a public relations\nnightmare, several banks finally budged and eliminated the monthly fee, Wells Fargo and Bank of\nAmerica among them. By the time the banks reversed their new policy, thousands of customers had\nmoved their accounts to credit unions. The major banks would lose more customers if they actually\nimplemented the charges. Miffed customers and consumer activists created a Bank Transfer Day, a\nmovement that garnered over fifty-eight thousand Facebook likes. The major retail banks learned the\nhard way that you must listen to your customers. Nowadays, with social media, you cannot act as if\nyour customers do not exist. A few other companies that have notoriously ignored customer needs\ninclude Verizon Wireless for its new monthly data charge, BlackBerry for its geriatric products that\nhaven’t kept up with the times, and Circuit City for its terrible customer service.\nExceptions to this rule are few. Rarely can a company dictate to its customers what they need.\nMost exceptions come from technology companies like Apple, which have created and dominate new\nproduct categories. However, technology companies must be able to respond quickly to customer\nissues and suggestions, iterating as often as possible until they get the right formula. They may have\nmore flexibility than other types of companies, but they, too, answer to the boss.\nJust because you are an entrepreneur doesn’t mean that you can’t get fired. In fact, entrepreneurs\nget fired every day by dissatisfied customers. Ensure that you listen closely to your customers and\nrespond to their changing needs in a quick fashion. If you introduce something new, be sure that you\nare prepared for the possibility that your suggestion could backfire.\n66) You Have Sales before You Have a Business\nForget about the business outlook. Be on the outlook for business.\n—Paul J. Meyer, author, businessman\nI had no intention of becoming an entrepreneur. The thought never crossed my mind as a viable and\nsustainable option in life. In fact, I was conditioned to think and accept that getting and working a\nwell-paying job was the Holy Grail, the consummate achievement in life. After finding a job, I then\ncould get married, have kids, retire, and die respectfully. Although I learned this restricted way of\nthinking at home, it was also reinforced in college. Every student worked hard to attain this\nPleasantville-like life. Some days when all students were required to dress alike, I felt like an\nunoriginal product on an assembly line, being constructed for the corporate world. Not knowing\nanything else, I welcomed the process and final delivery to corporate America.\nThat all changed when a website I developed in college became very popular. It was so popular\nthat I received inquiries from companies wanting to advertise. The first was from a dotcom called\nJobDirect, a web-based job-matching service for college students. JobDirect’s inquiry caught me\ncompletely off-guard, because I had no intention of selling ads on my website. I built the site for fun\nand to hone my web development skills. I simply wanted it to be the best college portal on the Web,\nand some would say that it was. In other words, I was passionate about the product, not profits.\nJobDirect was eager to advertise on my website and to have everything prepared for the back-\nto-school period, so negotiations about price and ad placement went quickly. I was clueless about the\nwhole process, so I searched online for any information to help me appear like I knew what I was\ndoing. I had no idea what to charge the company, how to structure the deal, or who the decision-\nmaker was. I gave JobDirect’s VP of campus relations an arbitrary figure for the cost of the banner ad\nthat made hardly any sense. Surprisingly, he accepted it without hesitation. I probably could have\ncharged more. By summer of my junior year, I had closed a partnership and deal with JobDirect that\nearned me an $1,800 check. When I received the check via FedEx, I copied it and framed it. I was\nespecially proud. My handsel wouldn’t be the normal wrinkled dollar bill you often see hanging on a\nbusiness’s wall, but a big check. However, there was just one problem: I couldn’t cash the check.\nMy website was not officially set up as a business, so I had a rather large check made out in my\nwebsite’s name and no way to cash it. However, with that much money at stake, I learned fast what I\nhad to do in order to open a bank account. I researched online the necessary steps to become an\nofficial business and followed each one. In fact, I used an online legal service to organize my articles\nof incorporation and file for my business license. Similarly, I submitted online my application for an\nEmployee Identification Number (EIN) with the IRS. Lastly, I took my articles of incorporation,\nbusiness license, EIN, and two forms of identification to the local Wachovia and opened my business\naccount. I was in business.\nI didn’t know it at the time, but having sales before having a business was proof that I had a\npromising venture. In fact, considering all the businesses I have started—and there have been many—\nthe most successful ones were those that had sales or significant demand before I even incorporated.\nThere is no better way to start a business than with purchase orders. I had no idea what I was doing,\nbut it was the best situation possible.\nAs a result, I am weary of those who go into business for the sake of being in business. On the\nother hand, I get excited about those who have a dynamic product or service that serves a salivating\nmarket. Which one are you?\n67) You Aren’t Always the Best Person to Close a Deal\nBeauty awakens the soul to act.\n—Dante Alighieri, Italian poet\nExcited to hit the pavement and to sell advertisements for my new magazine, I visited a local mom-\nand-pop store near my alma mater, Morehouse College. After my sales pitch, I waited to hear if the\nbusiness owner would place an ad in my next issue. He didn’t buy an ad, but he did give me\nsomething much more valuable than an order: unfiltered advice on how to make him a customer. The\nowner, who was in his mid-forties and brutally honest, said, “Kevin, I love your magazine, and I think\nplacing an ad in it would really help my business, but I will never buy from \nyou\n. Send your editor\nhere, and I’ll buy an ad from her every month!”\nChelsey, the editor of my magazine at the time, was one of the main reasons the magazine was so\npopular, and it wasn’t necessarily because she was a great editor. Every month, college-aged men\nwith raging hormones would rush to pick up the latest issue of the magazine to see Chelsey’s beautiful\npicture on her editor’s page. Likewise, she had a large fan club of older men who were just as eager\nto see her picture. When the business owner asked me to send Chelsey to visit him, I just smiled\nbecause I knew that was the only thing I could do to convince him to buy an ad. I obliged.\nBefore this eye-opening experience, I thought my customers would buy ads primarily for logical\nreasons like great prices, a large circulation, or quality content. Never did I think that customers\nwould buy ads for other, seemingly frivolous reasons. I was wrong and learned quickly to better\nunderstand and to assess a potential customer’s psyche, which gives clues on how to close that\nperson. In doing so, I had to come to the realization that in many cases, I, the CEO of the company,\nwas not always the best person to close a deal. As in the case of this local business owner,\nsometimes people would much rather buy from a future Miss USA contestant (Chelsey) than an\nenterprising geek (me), no matter how logically sound the geek’s offer is.\nNowadays, I see myself as the leader of a team of superstars who can close just about anyone.\nLike the owner of a winning professional sports team, I have put together a group of outstanding\npeople who can handle many different types of situations come game time. To increase the likelihood\nof a sale, we research our prospects and determine the best plan of action. For example, if a potential\ncustomer shows signs that she will respond better to a male, we send a male. In the same way that the\nLos Angeles Lakers coaching staff watches hours of film to determine player matchups, we find out as\nmuch as we can about our prospects to decide who should go on the sales call. Our approach is\ntremendously effective and renders great results through increased profits.\nDespite the proven results of this strategy, many entrepreneurs have a serious problem with it.\nThey think like I thought. They mistakenly believe that we have a utopian free market in which buyers\noperate on logic alone. In other words, buyers don’t judge offers by the person making the offer; they\ncan see past their own assumptions, stereotypes, impressions, and desires. Unfortunately, we are far\nfrom this point.\nIn a recent CNN feature \nBlack in America: The New Promised Land, Silicon Valley\n, a\nmultimillionaire entrepreneur of Indian descent ruffled some feathers with his candid advice. He\nencouraged young African American entrepreneurs to “get a white guy to be your front man.” The\nimplications of his advice are certainly disappointing and sad, but I agree with him wholeheartedly.\nUltimately, it’s about giving the merit of your offer the best chance possible. The entrepreneur’s job is\nnot to reform the buyer. Instead, understand what makes the customer tick and adjust.\nThe best entrepreneurs know that being a CEO doesn’t make you the best person to present to\ninvestors, to close a sale, or to do a number of other tasks. Perhaps you don’t speak with passion or\nyou have trouble communicating. In this case, you must be willing and able to adjust to different\nsituations to maximize your opportunities. As it relates to understanding your talents and gifts,\nMorehouse College alumnus Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. put it best in one of his sermons: “A Ford car\ntrying to be a Cadillac is absurd, but if a Ford will accept itself as a Ford, it can do many things that a\nCadillac could never do: it can get in parking spaces that a Cadillac can never get in.” King finalizes\nhis thought, saying, “The principle of self-acceptance is a basic principle in life.” I concur, and\nentrepreneurs who understand this principle in business are exponentially more successful.\n68) Networking Isn’t All about You\nThe currency of real networking is not greed but generosity.\n—Keith Ferrazzi, founder, CEO, Ferrazzi Greenlight\nI hate networking. Well, I should qualify my statement. I hate what networking has become in many\ninstances. As a result, I have altogether stopped going to self-proclaimed “exclusive networking\nevents,” because they yield such poor results and waste my precious time.\nInstead of quality experiences that facilitate exchanges and lead to business relationships, many\nnetworking events are nothing more than a mini-convention of extremely self-centered people. You\nknow these narcissistic types. Often they are the professional networkers who are dressed to draw\ntoo much attention, reek of disingenuousness, and heap their business cards on you before you can say\nhello. When they speak to you, the subtext of everything they say is, “I am the greatest! This is why\nyou should buy my product or service. Now, off to the next person.” If I find myself in a conversation\nwith such an individual, I watch the mouth move, but all I hear is, “Me, me, me.” Some may fool you\nfor a second by asking about your company, but then it’s back to, “I, I, I.” If you have the courage after\nten, fifteen, or twenty minutes of their shameless monologues—time you’ll never get back—you just\nleave them. They may not even notice you’ve left.\nWhen done correctly and effectively, networking isn’t about you. Rather, it’s about what you can\ndo to help others improve their businesses. Imagine if business owners asked you the following\nquestions at a networking event instead of talking aimlessly about themselves: “What is the best type\nof customer for your business?” “If I come across someone in my network, how would I know that\nthis person is a good customer for you?” “What specifically can I do to help your business grow?”\nWhat a difference! The likelihood of you doing business directly with someone you just met is small.\nHowever, the likelihood of you being able to help this person to find customers within your network\nis much greater. This attitude of service rather than self-service has made a huge difference in my\nbusiness. In fact, I use this approach all the time. It works during networking events and other\nsituations.\nTwo great benefits come with this paradigm shift. First, the discussion gets right to how a\nrelationship can help both of you grow. Little time is wasted on pretense. Most people will be\nshocked by your focus and unselfish willingness to help with exactly what they need, and they will\nnaturally catch on and return the favor. If not, you can always tell them how they can help you.\nSecond, this approach builds rapport faster than any other method. People are more inclined to trust\nthose who are willing to help and eventually do.\nMost people starting a business are especially excited about networking. The idea seems like the\nsmart thing to do in order to grow a business. However, after a while, many discover that the main\nresult is a stack of useless business cards. Some people end up like me, disillusioned by networking.\nI am being a bit extreme, though. I am not encouraging you to avoid networking events entirely,\nbut if you choose to attend them, get the most out of your experience by assuming an attitude of\nservice. Ultimately, it will come back to you multiple times.\n69) Don’t Waste Time on People Who Can’t Say Yes\nNever allow a person to tell you no who doesn’t have the power to say yes.\n—Eleanor Roosevelt, former First Lady, United States of America\nFew things are more irritating in business than dealing with a person who pretends to be a decision-\nmaker but in reality is just a subordinate. You know these misleading types. They may indeed work\nfor a company that you hope to establish as a client, and they may even have a title implying influence,\nbut they are in no way able to authorize anything. In the rare case that they are able to suggest a deal,\nthe request must go through so much approval and red tape that developing a strong relationship with\nthis individual was, in hindsight, probably not worth the effort. It would have been easier to find the\nreal decision-maker. Businesspeople waste billions of work hours calling, dining, and persuading\nthese tricksters in hopes of garnering some business only to find out that their efforts were in vain.\nThey eventually learn the hard way that if they can’t buy, you won’t sell.\nThis problem has no easy solution, but I have found one way to manage the situation quite\neffective. As you work your way through the different layers of people in search of a decision-maker,\nsimply be direct. Specifically, ask your contact once you’ve shared your intentions, “Who will make\nthe final decision on this?” You could also phrase it this way: “Who are the other people who will be\nincluded in making a final decision on this?” In most cases, your contact will answer your question\nwith the same directness you used. Asking questions like these significantly cuts down on the time you\nspend trying to sell someone who cannot buy.\nThese questions are open-ended, meaning they cannot be answered with a simple yes or no. If\nyou pose these questions in a yes-or-no format, they lose their potency. Asking an open-ended\nquestion in this situation forces the person answering to provide vital information that empowers you\nto be most effective. These types of questions leave little room for interpretation or misunderstanding.\nIn fact, you should use open-ended questions in business as often as you can.\nThis tactic does not give you a license to neglect or mistreat people who are between you and\nthe ultimate decision-maker. Tread lightly and treat everyone involved in the process with the utmost\nrespect, from the secretary to the CEO. You want those who aren’t necessarily decision-makers but\ninfluencers to also buy in to what you propose. Insiders, those who work for the company you hope to\nbring on as a client, have influence on decision-makers. Sometimes these individuals yield more\ninfluence than you think. Your goal should be to draft them onto your team so that they can sell your\nidea from the inside.\nThis small but powerful change had an immediate impact on my business when I adopted it, from\nfaster results when selling to more interested investors when pitching. After asking the suggested\nquestions, I received clarity; I knew exactly whom my target was. Without such vital information you\nare throwing darts while blindfolded, wishing to hit the bull’s-eye. That’s no way to run a successful\nbusiness. Take off the blindfold by using this approach and increase your chances for getting a yes.\n70) There’s No Such Thing as a Cold Call\nA winning effort begins with preparation.\n—Joe Gibbs, former NFL coach, race team owner\nAt a recent entrepreneurship conference where there was a panel with angel investors, an audience\nmember asked the following questions, “Do you take cold calls? And if you do, what should I, as a\nbusiness owner seeking capital, say?” One of the panelists, Valerie Gaydos, founder and president of\nCapital Growth, answered the question like most people would expect an angel investor to. She\nresponded that she doesn’t take cold calls. Instead, she screens potential companies with her partners\nwho bring her quality companies. However, Timothy Reese, managing partner and general manager of\nForge Intellectual Capital, surprised everyone by saying, “I \ndo\n take cold calls, but your call shouldn’t\nbe cold.” Everyone in the audience perked up to hear his advice on how to effectively reach out to an\nangel investor who knows nothing about you or your company.\nWhen giving his candid advice, Reese emphasized that you must first know as much about his\ncompany as possible. For instance, if you are looking for an investment in your apparel company and\nhis firm doesn’t invest in those types of companies, you are wasting your time. It is imperative that\nyou research the types of deals that an angel has done and prefers so that you have a better chance of\ncatching the angel’s attention. Furthermore, you should know the size of the deals, and if the\ninformation is available, how those deals were structured. It requires quite a bit of research and hard\nwork on your end, but as another angel, Daymond John, on the panel mentioned, this could be the big\ndeal of your life. You don’t want to go in totally cold and “botch” the opportunity.\nIf you are an elite entrepreneur, you don’t go into anything cold. Whether you are selling a\nproduct or selling your company to an investor, you should know as much as you can about the\nprospect. Nowadays, there is no excuse for being unprepared. A plethora of informational resources\nare at hand, the Internet being the most common. Entrepreneurs who go the extra mile to better\nposition themselves in a sale always come out better than an entrepreneur who tries to wing it.\nThe biggest benefit of doing your homework is instantly establishing trust and credibility with\nyour prospect, which goes a long way. As angel investor Reese suggested in his advice, an\nentrepreneur who approaches him and knows his background instantly earns his respect and ear.\nLikewise, your cold calls can warm up quickly when you’ve researched your prospects thoroughly.\nThey will appreciate your efforts to understand their position.\nHere’s one technique that exhibits how you can establish rapport when making cold calls. Don’t\nfocus only on yourself or your product when you communicate with a prospect for the first time.\nInstead, mention the vital information that your research revealed. For illustration purposes, let’s say\nthat your investigation uncovered the prospect’s previous buying history and their need to cut costs.\nYou could start a conversation by saying, “I understand that you have purchased from company A in\nthe past, but I would love to share with you how our product has been rated the highest quality by an\nindependent source and costs less.” By saying this, you’ve done two important things: earned trust by\nreviewing the prospect’s buying history and sparked interest with a way to reduce costs. Using\ntechniques like this gives you a great advantage over your competition.\nThe likelihood of closing a sale is directly linked to the preparation that goes into making that\nsale. Before you attempt to persuade any prospect your way, take the time to find out as much as you\ncan about the person. You’ll never have a cold call again.\n71) Tell Everyone about Your Business\nKids: they dance before they learn there is anything that isn’t music.\n—William Stafford, poet\nFor the past two years, I have had the privilege of being an instructor for the Teenpreneur conference,\na two-day program that has taught thousands of teens the vital concepts of entrepreneurship. Along\nwith other instructors who are entrepreneurs, I have instructed young students on how to write a\nbusiness plan, how to sell, how to select a business concept that they love, and where they can find\nhelp to build their business. The program also brings some of the most successful entrepreneurs and\nbusiness executives to talk to the teens. For example, the CEO of Capri Investment Capital (Quintin E.\nPrimo III), who manages assets of over $3.6 billion, came to the conference in 2012 and talked about\nhow he has built his trailblazing company. I enjoy teaching and working with the teens because they\nare focused and excited to learn how to build wealth through entrepreneurship. I really love the fact\nthat many students already have thriving businesses, even as teenagers.\nEvery year we have a handful of students who already have businesses that make money. This\nyear, a young lady who makes customized balloon shapes and animals attended our sessions. She\nstarted her company at the age of nine after she received a kit that showed her how to make balloon\nart. Now, as elegant and well-spoken as any adult CEO, the sixteen-year-old manages a thriving\nbusiness with corporate clients. With 2011 revenues topping $5,500, she is expanding her business to\ninclude other party services like face painting and storytelling. Another teenager, fifteen-years-old,\nbakes delicious cookies. As stated in her company’s professional brochure, she is “baking her way\ninto college.” A couple of young men who are juniors in high school have an artist management\ncompany. They break new artists based on a successful formula that they have developed. In fact, the\ntwo men won the conference’s pitch competition, which required them to woo a panel of three judges\nby describing their business in three minutes. Moreover, a fourteen-year-old young woman had\nstarted a concession stand at her church to serve mainly people who have no time to eat breakfast\nbefore church. She has made good money with her clever business.\nIn addition to these teenagers being truly inspiring, they taught us adults a basic lesson that many\nolder and veteran entrepreneurs struggle with. The lesson? Entrepreneurs should tell everyone about\ntheir business and do it unapologetically.\nWith no fear, each of the students who had a business talked to everyone at the conference about\ntheir business. For example, the young lady with the balloon creation and entertainment company\narrived at the conference thirty minutes before it began with sample balloons in hand. She was\ndressed in a business suit and eager to tell every person who came to the conference her business’s\nstory. The youngster with the concession stand business brought her basket of candy and was selling it\nto everyone, including parents who came the final day for the graduation ceremony. She was working\nhard. I was especially impressed with her initiative. For instance, she bought a large bag of candy\nfrom a conference participant who won it for volunteering. The participant didn’t want the bag of\ncandy, so she bought it from him for much less than its worth and sold each packaged unit for a\nquarter. She later told me (after I bought some candy) that she made twice as much as she paid for it;\nshe was even making deals during the conference. Other teens were making sales and spreading the\nword about their babysitting service, lawn care service, bakery, and so on. They had no fear, and if\nthey did, you certainly couldn’t tell.\nToward the end of the conference, one of my co-instructors pointed out that for whatever reason,\nmany adults lose or never develop their fearless ability to tell others about their business. Strangely,\nsome entrepreneurs think that they will magically receive business for being passive and not\nbothering others. They confuse being humble with being quiet. Another possible reason for their\nreticence is conditioning. The same instructor mentioned, “I am from the South, and women aren’t\nencouraged to be forward. We aren’t taught to be aggressive and to tell people about our businesses.”\nMoreover, some entrepreneurs are simply afraid of a negative response. Whatever the reason, a lot of\nbusiness is lost because inhibited entrepreneurs have decided that telling others about their business\nis offensive, pompous, inconvenient, or counterproductive.\nAn entrepreneur who doesn’t tell people about his or her business is like a baseball player at bat\nwho swings only when it’s sunny, missing a lot of good pitches that could be home runs. The passive\nentrepreneur serves no one except the competition by staying quiet. We all know that business doesn’t\ncome easy and that you may not naturally be a people person, but you have to get out of your comfort\nzone. The rules of the game are to take advantage of every opportunity you have, which means\nengaging other people. Otherwise, you will never maximize your potential. Like a fearless teenage\nentrepreneur, develop the habit of telling everyone about your business. It will make a significant\ndifference. Besides, if you don’t, I know some sharp teenagers who are willing and able to take the\nbusiness if you are too scared to pursue it.\n72) Ask the Right Questions\nSuccessful people ask better questions, and as a result, they get better answers.\n—Tony Robbins, author, professional speaker\nAs an entrepreneur, your success depends greatly on your ability to ask the right questions. However,\nfew people understand the enormous value of mastering this art. I would argue that several\nentrepreneurs—business professionals, too—have no idea that the quality of the questions they ask\ndetermines their fate.\nWhy is mastering the art of asking good questions not a high priority on the list of skills to\nacquire for entrepreneurs? Perhaps we assume that all questions are created equal, and that’s simply\nnot true. Depending on the situation, there are good questions and bad questions. Being able to\ndetermine the difference gives you a competitive advantage in business. Let’s examine exactly what\ngood and bad questions are.\nIn general, a bad question is one that doesn’t encourage a substantive answer. For example, if\nyou have just received an order from a new customer, “Shall I send you an invoice?” is a poor\nquestion. This question can be answered quite easily without any detailed information that could help\nyou speed up the entire payment process, not to mention that the answer is quite obvious. The\nprospect may simply answer, “Yes.” Of course, you could follow up with another question—“How\nlong will it take for payment?”—but you now sound a bit imposing and impatient. A good question in\nthis situation would be, “What are the steps you have to go through to issue payment?” This question\ninvokes a much more thorough answer without an imposing follow-up question. Perhaps the client\nreveals in the answer that one of the steps is issuing a check from a third party, which takes at least a\nweek. Knowing this, you can now offer suggestions to expedite the payment process, such as\nencouraging the client to pay with a credit card because you offer a 5 percent discount.\nAsking the right questions after an objection is perhaps the most important time when this skill\ncomes in handy. Customers rarely share the true reasons behind their hesitations, and the right\nquestions can reveal those reasons. For instance, to overcome an objection about price, try asking,\n“What kind of return on investment are you expecting?” After cleverly exposing the truth through good\nquestions, you can directly address objections, improving your chances of winning over an\nindividual. Likewise, addressing objections in this way helps entrepreneurs with vetting or refining a\nstart-up idea.\nA common impediment that customers have is high cost. In several negotiations, customers have\ncomplained that my price is too high. After asking them, for example, to describe their budgetary\nprocess, I might learn that cost is often not the issue. Frequently, customers overspend their budgets\nfor a given time period, in which case you could invoice them during two separate periods or suggest\nthat they share the costs with another department with available funds. You can receive the full value\nfor your product or service if you know the right questions to ask. A bad question or simply not asking\nany question after an objection could cost you that million-dollar deal.\nAvoid closed-ended questions, which can be answered with a simple yes or no. In general,\nopen-ended questions are much better than simple yes-or-no questions. For instance, instead of asking\na potential customer if she is satisfied with a competitor’s product or service, ask specifically what\nshe likes and dislikes about it. This information is highly valuable and helps you position your\ncompany to win her business.\nIn his book Questions That Sell, author Paul Cherry writes, “Research has shown that during\ntypical business interactions customers reveal only 20 percent of what is on their minds. . . . It is your\nresponsibility to get to the other 80 percent.” The best entrepreneurs get to this other 80 percent by\nasking the right questions and turning the answers into an irresistible business solution. As you\ncontinue to improve your skills, whether in selling or product development, focus on mastering the art\nof asking great questions to take your business to the next level. There’s no question (pun intended)\nthat you’ll see an improvement immediately.\n73) Receive the Maximum Value for Your Products or Services\nOur belief was that if we kept putting great products in front of customers, they would continue to open their wallets.\n—Steve Jobs, cofounder, Apple\nAs a sophomore in college, I cofounded a Latin jazz band called Río Negro with a Puerto Rican\nfriend of mine who played congas. We loved everything about Latin music and soon found other\nmusicians from our school to join the band. After becoming popular on campus, we began to do more\nhigh-profile performances around Atlanta, even playing for Super Bowl XXXIV and President Bill\nClinton. During those early days, we played most performances for free while we established our\nname and honed our style. However, as our popularity grew, we began to accept paying gigs from\ncorporations and organizations willing to pay us. We had no idea what to charge or how to charge. As\nthe bandleader I determined our rates and handled the band’s business.\nFor a long time, we thought that the amount we charged for our performances was standard. The\nproblem was that our standard was pretty low, contrary to the high quality of music we produced. We\ndidn’t learn about how low our standard was until a veteran musician in town called our attention to\nit. This veteran jazz guitarist had a reputation for being brutally blunt. In fact, he was infamous for\nkicking subpar musicians off stage at jam sessions. In that characteristic cool and nonchalant tone that\nall old jazz musicians have, he complained, “You young cats are doin’ big gigs for a few hundred\ndollars. These are $2,000 gigs, man. You are messin’ with my money!” One of my band members\nactually got into a spat with the disgruntled man during a commercial break for a radio station\ninterview. They just happened to be there at the same time.\nRealizing that our standard was indeed too low and considering that we wanted to make a living\nfrom music, I decided to increase our rates significantly. I thought that the change would be as simple\nas raising the rates and collecting bigger checks. I was wrong: It didn’t quite work out that way.\nSeveral of our prospects had sticker shock, hearing the higher rates and almost always saying no\nthanks. As a result, I reverted to our lower rates, thinking that this was the only way we would get\ngigs. Before long, we resented the grind for such little pay. It just wasn’t as fun anymore. I decided to\ntry something new: sticking firmly to the higher rates and not giving in.\nFor months, we didn’t get many gigs, but I stuck to the plan with my band members’ support. I\nreceived several rejections, but I would also hear and sense genuine disappointment from those who\nwanted to hire us but couldn’t. People really wanted our band to play for their events. Some even told\nme that they would request a larger budget the next year so that they could hire us. Sure enough, the\nnext year several of the companies and organizations that couldn’t afford us before found the money to\nsecure us at the rate we requested. Apparently, telling these clients no built our value tremendously. It\nwas as if they respected us for holding our ground. The strategy seemed counterintuitive at first, but it\nworked. Our brand and reputation grew as we demanded and received higher pay.\nFrom this experience, I learned a valuable lesson that I apply in my other businesses: Set your\nprice or rate and demand that you get it. This requires you to respectfully say no when prospects ask\nyou to lower your rate, but in many cases they will respect you more for holding your ground and may\ncome back later willing to pay. You’ll also need extra patience, because it will take time to develop\nthe demand for your company, especially if you have to wait for a new annual budget. Sometimes I\nunabashedly suggest that my potential buyer request more money from their company to meet our\nprices.\nOf course, this strategy requires that you offer the best quality available. You can’t demand top\ndollar if your product or service can be easily substituted. My band was unique in the Atlanta market,\ngiving us a significant competitive advantage and demand. We played a type of music that not many\nbands played in our city, and we did it well. No one pays a premium price for poor quality—at least\nnot twice.\nNovice entrepreneurs often make the mistake of devaluing the worth of their product or service.\nWhile lowering your price may be an effective way to enter a market or to gain customers, it\neventually corrodes profitability in the long term. Companies that compete on price alone tend to go\nout of business quickly. Strive to stay in business for decades like Apple. The most valuable company\nin the world in August 2012 with a market capitalization of $619 billion, Apple has never\ncompromised on demanding high prices for its products. At the same time, it has never compromised\non delivering excellent products. As with Apple and several other premium brands, high quality and\nhigh prices can make your company a winner, too. Now that should be music to your ears.\n74) Don’t Patronize Customers\nCompanies don’t get rich hurting their customers.\n—John Stossel, consumer reporter\nAt a private business club I introduced a friend of mine to an important prospective client who could\nbring him a lot of business. While introducing him, I emphasized his recent accomplishment of being\nfeatured in an issue of a national business magazine. Because of my warm introduction and\nendorsement, the prospect was especially excited about my friend’s business and how it could help\nher. I was sure that he had already won her business. Naturally, my friend asked for her contact\ninformation to follow up, but after taking it, he ruined his chances of closing the deal.\nAfter he took her e-mail address and phone number, he said with a flat, uninterested tone, “I’ll\nhave my assistant give you a call tomorrow.” I wanted to grab him by the shoulders, shake him a few\ntimes, and scold him for doing what he just did. I didn’t need to, though. His prospect retorted, “I\nwant you to call me!” It was too late. In less than five seconds, he managed to jeopardize tens of\nthousands of dollars in new business and to tarnish what started off as a great first impression for his\nservice-oriented company.\nI often witness young entrepreneurs make this cardinal mistake: patronizing customers to appear\nprofessional. In doing so, they alienate their customers and cut off their own limbs. You know it as\nsoon as it happens. Perhaps the most egregious example is when a founding CEO pushes you off to an\nassistant, like my friend did. The examples are virtually endless of the pompous CEO who does more\nharm than good.\nWhy do entrepreneurs and CEOs act this way? In many instances, they don’t know that they are\nwrong or that their actions are harmful. Other times, the action is quite deliberate. Young CEOs—and\nthey’re not alone—patronize their customers for four main reasons.\n1. \nThey think that CEOs are supposed to act this way.\n They have an ill-conceived notion of\nwhat a CEO is and how a CEO acts. Nowhere does it say in the definition of CEO that you must act\nas if you are not accessible or that you are above customers and the people who work for you.\n2. \nThey take a bit too far the common advice to delegate.\n CEOs indeed must be good at\ndelegating. This skill reinforces clear roles within the company and helps to manage time. However,\nyou must use common sense, too. It’s not as easy as methodically directing certain tasks to certain\npeople regardless of the context. Especially when dealing with customers directly, delegating\nrequires a certain level of finesse. For instance, my friend at least should have asked the prospect if it\nwas alright to have his assistant call her. Ideally, if he were actually that busy or had strict policies\non protocol, he would have called her the next day to establish trust and to explain his company’s\norder process from that point on.\n3. \nTheir ego is too big for their own good.\n Just because you have a business and you are an\nentrepreneur doesn’t give you license to be condescending to anyone. In fact, it has nothing to do with\nbusiness. In general, people dislike arrogant people. Arrogant CEOs, especially leaders of start-ups,\nneed a consistent dose of humility. Ironically, most of them are just a few irate clients away from\nfailure.\n4. \nThey want to give the impression that they lead a big business.\n Somehow young CEOs\ndelude themselves into believing that clients respect bigger companies more or that their highly\nprofessional front can justify higher prices. To the contrary, my experience has been that this is not a\nfavorable assumption for most entrepreneurs. No matter how large your company may be, if your\nbrand is unfamiliar, you won’t necessarily benefit from the extra respect that a Fortune 500 company\nreceives. Respect mostly comes from how you treat customers individually and the high quality of\nyour work. You aren’t fooling anyone but yourself.\nLike my friend, you may need an \nUndercover\n \nBoss\n reality check. Even if you are the CEO of\nyour company, never make clients feel less than they are. There is no justification for it at all. Your\njob is to make your clients and your employees feel as if they are the most important people in the\nworld.\n75) Build Your Network Creatively\nIt isn’t just what you know, and it isn’t just who you know. It’s actually who you know, who knows you, and what you do for a living.\n— Bob Burg, best-selling author, \nEndless Referrals\nIf you go to hit-or-miss networking events to build your business, you probably aren’t making the best\nof your time. The value of networking in the traditional sense where random people meet and try to\nconnect the dots is next to nil. In fact, the value may be negative and is therefore hurting your\nbusiness.\nFor a moment years ago, many people thought that this kind of networking was getting an\nupgrade. In 2001, entrepreneurs and professionals from all fields welcomed the new idea of\nNetWeaving, a concept introduced by author and businessman Bob Littell. NetWeaving, as described\nby the book that teaches the technique, is “all about giving and helping others while having the\nconfidence to know that eventually you, the NetWeaver, will benefit in return.” This strategy is more\neffective than traditional networking, but it still doesn’t give you a direct plan of attack. Moreover,\nyou could possibly find business for everyone else, and the favors never return to you, or they just\ntake too long to do so. Consequently, the NetWeaving craze didn’t last long at all.\nNetworking should take on a different meaning to you as an entrepreneur. It should not only mean\ngoing to an event in hopes that you’ll meet someone there who can help you grow your business.\nInstead, it should mean following these four important steps:\n1. Being proactive\n2. Being creative\n3. Meeting the right people (what I often call “check writers”)\n4. Finding the most appropriate environment\nNetworking this way gives you the best chance at actually closing a major deal, and that’s what\nit is all about.\nFor example, I have found that volunteering for charities and nonprofits provides a great\nopportunity for me to meet C-level and director-level professionals who can authorize a deal with my\ncompany. First, this strategy meets the proactive requirement. Volunteerism is not for wimps. It\ndemands a commitment to and accountability from others. Second, it meets the creative test. Most\npeople wouldn’t put volunteerism and networking together. Third, it gets me to the right people. Many\ncorporate decision-makers are proud of the charities they support. In fact, some companies strongly\nencourage that their employees give a portion of their time to charities like Habitat for Humanity.\nNaturally, leaders take part in these initiatives to encourage the involvement of the rest of their team.\nFourth, I’m in a “no selling” environment that instantly builds rapport. When a prospect sees you\nvolunteering for a charity, the shared experience reflects well on you. Also, it evokes a good feeling\nin a prospect that increases the likelihood of doing business.\nYears ago I saw a huge growth opportunity in doing business with financial institutions. I\nidentified a nonprofit that was well-sponsored by the companies I wanted to have as clients,\nincluding Wells Fargo, Nationwide, Bank of America, and H&R Block. I also was able to find the\nindividuals in these large companies who volunteered at the nonprofit and learn their corporate roles.\nNext, I offered my time and resources to the nonprofit, which teaches financial literacy and\nentrepreneurship to high school and college students. To make a long story short, I met many C-level\nsupporters who wrote or authorized checks for the nonprofit. Moreover, the CEO of the nonprofit,\nseeing my dedication to his organization, gave me excellent introductions to his check-writing\nsponsors. As a result, my company ended up doing a lot of business with these companies and\ncontinues to do so today.\nI cannot guarantee you that following this specific example will work for your business, but I can\nsay that following the four rules outlined will help you become more effective in getting to the right\npeople. As opposed to hoping to meet the right people at an event, guarantee your presence with\ndecision-makers by implementing this methodology. You won’t win using old networking techniques.\n76) Don’t Hold Grudges\nAnger dwells only in the bosom of fools.\n—Albert Einstein, German physicist\nEntrepreneurship is a humbling exercise in learning how to deal with your negative feelings, so as to\ndo what’s best for your company. One of the most difficult feelings to tame is anger caused by a\nprospective customer who finds no value in your product or service and tells you so. I come across\nthis situation often when mentoring young entrepreneurs who are so confident about their company\nthat they really believe their offer is the best thing since sliced bread. They think, \nHow can anyone\nsay no to what we have to offer?\n In what they think is a retaliatory move, they curse the prospective\ncustomer. They convert a no that they received into a “never” by writing off the prospect.\nI can certainly relate to this feeling of anger and disappointment that stems from rejection. It was\nespecially intense when I courted customers, especially big ones, that for no apparent reason\nsuddenly reneged on their commitment to buy. I vividly remember pursuing a Fortune 100 client for\nyears. Finally, it agreed to sign a multiyear, six-figure contract, only to disappear when the time came\nto sign on the dotted line. I couldn’t believe that the deal fell through in that way. A novice\nentrepreneur, I was bitter and vowed never to have anything more to do with the company.\nThe phrase “This is business, not personal” made popular in \nThe\n \nGodfather\n certainly applies to\nthis lesson. You must not take business “personal” because it pushes you off track and leads to\nterrible business decisions. Instead, transform rejection or a negative occurrence in your business to\npositive energy that helps you persevere. That’s the mark of a veteran entrepreneur.\nThe simplest rule to follow in any business relationship is to treat even those who reject you like\nthey are your biggest and best clients. Be courteous at all times, send thank-you notes, and provide\nthem with information to help them in their business. These are just a few suggestions on how to\nmaintain a positive reputation and boost chances of any opportunity in the future. Don’t write them off\nby speaking ill of them, suspending future contact, removing them from your mailing list, or even\nwishing them harm. Whatever you do, don’t cease communication, because conditions could change\nfor the better at any moment; when they do, you’ll want the client to feel that the lines of\ncommunication have always been open.\nAs an entrepreneur, your ability to turn anger caused by rejection into motivation to persevere\ncan take your company to soaring heights. Negative feelings can be your worst enemy, causing you to\nmiss huge opportunities. I almost missed a big one. The Fortune 100 company I mentioned earlier that\npulled out of a major deal did come around much later. My change in fortune may have come from\nkilling them with kindness. It doesn’t pay to hold grudges in business. If you do, you can only be angry\nwith yourself.\nChapter 6\nLeadership\nLeadership and learning are indispensable to each other.\n—John F. Kennedy, thirty-fifth president, United States of America\nLeaders are born, not made. What do you think? Many people disagree. While some people\nseem to come out of the womb with leadership qualities, they don’t have a monopoly on leadership,\nespecially when it comes to business.\nLeadership qualities can be taught and learned. Countless examples are available of tech\nentrepreneurs who learned to be leaders of their companies—and are quite good ones. Mark\nZuckerberg, the cofounder of Facebook who was coached by business veterans, comes to mind. Once\na reserved geek, he is now a dynamic CEO of a billion-dollar company.\nIn this chapter, you read about some of the main leadership qualities that entrepreneurs have and\nwhy they are important.\n77) Act in Spite of How You Feel\nA clear understanding of negative emotions dismisses them.\n—Vernon Howard, author, philosopher\nIf I had missed this huge opportunity, my company would have possibly left millions on the table.\nDuring the previous two nights, I had gotten three hours of sleep. I was exhausted and needed\nrest badly. My eyes were bloodshot, I had a slight headache, and I was growing irritable. During a\nnational conference for entrepreneurs, I was working diligently as an instructor, finishing up a major\nproject for my company, working on a new book, and entertaining friends who were also in town. I\nwas overwhelmed. I was used to a less intensive schedule. To make matters more challenging, I was\nstill adjusting to a time-zone change.\nDuring the last night of the conference, when attendees were dressed in their best suits and\ngowns to enjoy the culminating gala and enthusiastic to make final contacts, my mind was elsewhere.\nWhile I should have been energetic and ready to speak with everyone I could about my business, I\nwas more concerned with eating dinner and going to sleep afterward. I couldn’t wait for the end of\nthe conference so I could rest.\nAs I walked around the ballroom noticing the different tables labeled with Fortune 100\nsponsors, I passed the table of a large financial services company that for months I had been trying to\ngain as a client. When I saw the table, I was instantly reminded that one of the main reasons I attended\nthe conference was to pursue new business for my new start-up, a data analytics company. As\nopposed to many of the other corporate tables, the financial services company table was full of\nrepresentatives from the company. At this moment I was determined to not let my sleep deprivation\nruin my chances of making a great connection.\nRealizing the need to take advantage of the big opportunity, I eventually overcame my lethargy\nand unwillingness to connect with people. I conjured up every ounce of energy left in my body. With\nnewfound strength and excitement, I gave the entire table my sixty-second pitch. At first I thought it\ndidn’t go over well. By the looks on their faces, they seemed uninterested. I thought that my words\nhad fallen on deaf ears, but then things turned for the good. One gentleman next to where I was\nstanding at the table turned toward me and said that he was interested in my product. He understood\nthe concept instantly and genuinely seemed excited about it. Before I knew it, he handed me his\nbusiness card and told me to contact him.\nThis gentleman was a company vice president in charge of buying the technology that my\ncompany offers. What I had tried to do for months just occurred in a few seconds, all because I was\nable to push through the inertia of my negative feelings. If I had let my emotions rule, I would have\nwalked right past that table. I would have missed perhaps one of the biggest connections in my\nbusiness life.\nWinning entrepreneurs act in spite of how they feel. It’s not always easy to do so. In fact,\novercoming what we feel like doing versus what we should be doing is a daily battle in all areas of\nlife, but it is a battle you must win. As you move forward toward your business goals, don’t let your\nemotions cause you to miss a phenomenal, life-changing opportunity. If you do, you could be missing\nout on a lot of money.\n78) Push beyond Your Fear\nAs soon as the fear approaches near, attack and destroy it.\n—Chanakya, Indian philosopher\nWhen I pulled through the grand entrance and saw the massive race track, I was overcome by a\ngripping fear. I could only see a few turns of the track, but the part I saw was enough to give me a shot\nof adrenaline, the kind that makes your stomach ache and gives you a metallic taste in your mouth. I\nhad raced on smaller tracks, giving me an inflated sense of confidence, but this was the real deal, a\nchallenging track used for professional and amateur sports car and motorcycle races.\nThat sunny Saturday morning, I arrived at Road Atlanta, a 2.54-mile track located about an hour\nnorth of Atlanta, Georgia. The track hosts the famous Petit Le Mans race, an annual sports car\nendurance race that draws over one hundred thousand fans. It was declared one of the best road\ncourses in \nCar and Driver\n magazine in 2010. My client, Cadillac, invited me that day to their touring\nCadillac V-Lab event, which allows VIP attendees to experience the 556 horsepower of the world’s\nfastest luxury sedan, the Cadillac CTS-V.\nAfter drag racing, short-course laps, and sessions on driving technique, the day culminated with\nracing on the track at full speed. My fear had subsided over the course of the day, but when our\ninstructors summoned us to the pits, it returned with almost crippling intensity. The roaring engines\nand cars whipping past at speeds well over one hundred miles per hour fueled my anxiety.\nNevertheless, I put on my face guard, grabbed my helmet, and found my game face.\nWhat intimidated me most about the track, or at least the part I could see, were the elevation\nchanges. They were visually terrifying. I would later find out that the elevation changes were the least\nof my worries. During my test run on the track, I encountered the track’s famous or infamous “esses.”\nI wasn’t even going full speed, but I quickly lost my bearings and ended up running off the track. My\ninstructor had to grab the wheel of the car to get me back on course. I was so embarrassed. From that\npoint on, I was especially anxious, but eager to prove myself.\nNevertheless, I eventually recovered after a few more test runs and made a comeback. My fear\ngradually turned into excitement. On the straightaway part of the track, I reached 124 mph, a speed\nthat I had never reached in a car on a race track. Despite running off the track earlier and allowing the\nesses to get to my psyche, I left my fear in the dust. I was able to complete a full-throttle run in a\nrespectable time.\nAs I reflect on that exhilarating day, I realize that starting a business is similar in many ways.\nWhat it takes to be a successful race car driver is the perfect metaphor for what it takes to be a great\nentrepreneur. While you are excited for the journey ahead, you often must overcome your fears of\nfailure and the unknown. The entrepreneurial path, just like a race track, has chicanes, undulating\nesses, tight hairpins, variations in elevation, and several twists and turns. All of these obstacles can\ncause fear.\nBut even if you are frightened and run off the road like I did, you push forward. You grab the\nwheel and step on the gas pedal, pushing through your inhibitions. Your commitment to the goal\novercomes your trepidation, and that’s what being an entrepreneur is all about.\n79) Be a Maverick\nHere’s to the crazy ones. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones who see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy\nones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.\n—Apple, “Think Different” campaign, advertising copy\nIt’s no coincidence that several of the most successful and famous entrepreneurs were mavericks at a\nyoung age. You will also find that this rebellious nature is most evident during the teenage years and\nthe early twenties, a time when young adults question the world in which they live and challenge the\nauthorities that make the rules.\nFor instance, as fearless teenagers, the founders of Apple, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, built\nand sold their illegal blue boxes for $150 to customers who wanted to make long distance calls for\nfree. Blue boxes were popular in the 1970s with drug dealers and other unsavory characters because\nthey made tracing their phone calls impossible. In fact, Berkeley Blue and Oaf Tobark, the aliases that\nWozniak and Jobs used, respectively, to conduct their illegal business actually were robbed at\ngunpoint when trying to sell their blue box to a shady prospect. Jobs was quoted as saying that Apple\nwould never have existed if he and his best friend, Wozniak, had not gone through their blue-box\nexperience. Perhaps being threatened with a pistol motivated them to conduct business on the stock\nmarket, not the black market.\nFast-forward about twenty-five years. Two other mavericks who would also change the world\nas we know it were up to no good. The founders of a new search engine called BackRub were busy\ncasing the loading dock at Stanford University’s computer science building. The two students were\nstealing new computers that were delivered to the computer science department for use in the\nstudents’ own search engine project that needed more computing power. The two thieves were Sergey\nBrin and Larry Page, the founders of Google. According to their professors, this irreverence for the\ncomputer science department’s property was not shocking. Brin and Page often challenged their\nprofessors, frequently calling them “bastards.” Apparently, not even the possibility of arrest was\nenough to stop these two mavericks—or processor pirates—from pursuing their idea.\nJust a few years later I found myself in college, unknowingly continuing the tradition of\nrebellious young techies who transform their mischievous energy into entrepreneurial genius. I\ncertainly wasn’t selling products to gangster-like characters or stealing computers from my computer\nscience department, but I did manage to undermine the communications system of my college by\ncreating my own more popular system. Students had more confidence in my web-based system than\nthe school’s system, which was often offline due to networking problems. In fact, I had so much\npower that the president of my college summoned me to his office to have a talk with me. I created my\nsystem in part because the school turned down my proposal to create web-based software that would\nfacilitate student communication and would move telephone registration to online registration.\nCreating my own system was my way of getting them back for rejecting me. This experience served as\nthe basis for my eventual desire to be an entrepreneur and to create my own company.\nAs mavericks grow older, their rebellious nature stays with them and is a significant contributor\nto their entrepreneurial success. What we know as teenage rebellion often becomes industry\ndisruption, a new way of doing things that upsets those who support the status quo. These mavericks\ngo on to change the world. If you ever needed a reason to tap into your desire to be a rebel, you have\none now.\n80) Make Your Dreams Come True\nAll our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.\n—Walt Disney, founder, the Walt Disney Company\nAs he approached the middle of the basketball court, Michael Jordan had tears in his eyes. It was\nhalftime during his final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, a highly emotional moment for sports fans\naround the world. Amid thunderous applause and with a packed Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia,\nJordan waved to the cheering fans and cherished the special moment. After a long standing ovation,\nhe humbly said, “To all the fans who supported the game of basketball, not just Michael Jordan. I\nthank you for your support. I leave the game in good hands. . . . Now I can go home and feel at peace\nwith the game of basketball.” I was there in person and had a front-row seat to history in the making.\nGrowing up in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, from age six to about eleven years old, all I did was\nplay and watch basketball. My friends and I all wanted to go to the NBA. We were obsessed. I loved\nbasketball so much that my father paid a good sum of money to pave our backyard with asphalt and\nerect a regulation basketball hoop. My older brother and I played out there most of the year—in\nfreezing snow and in one-hundred-plus-degree weather. I played in every league that I could during\nevery season. I religiously did my basketball drills in my basement (basketball fans remember the\nspider dribble and figure-eight drills). I was determined to live up to my namesake and make it to the\npros . . . until I stopped growing at five-feet-nine.\nWhen I stopped growing, I started studying. With the same passion I once played basketball, I\nstudied math and science. While a junior in high school, I received a full scholarship compliments of\nNASA to attend Morehouse College in Atlanta and study computer science. Even though trying to\nmake it to the NBA was never about chasing money, I now understood that I would have to make my\nmillions in technology instead of bouncing a ball. While in college I figured out that entrepreneurship\nwas the ideal path for me to follow. Building my business gave me the same exciting and fulfilling\nfeeling that playing basketball gave me when I was younger.\nJust three years after I started my company, the NBA approached me to help promote its 2003\nAll-Star Game in Atlanta. My company had done work with the Atlanta Hawks franchise the year\nbefore, and the Hawks marketing department recommended my company to the NBA when it sought\nreputable local companies to partner with during the All-Star Game. The NBA hired my company to\nmarket the 2003 weekend and to help make it a huge success. I was especially thrilled because not\nonly was my dream as a kid to play in the NBA, but I also wanted to attend the three-point contest and\nexciting slam-dunk contest. Here was my chance to do so.\nDuring that weekend, I had the opportunity to be around many of my sports heroes, including\nMagic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Isaiah Thomas, Shaquille O’Neil, and many more.\nCelebrities were hanging out, too. Nick Cannon, Ashton Kutcher, Nelly, and others were there. But\nthere was no experience like the NBA All-Star Game itself. Because I had an extra ticket to the game,\nI invited my dad to go with me. He booked a flight from Chicago and joined me for one of the most\nexciting times of my life, and all due to my entrepreneurial efforts.\nEven though I have never played in an NBA game, my dream to work for the NBA still came\ntrue. It just turned out to be different than what I expected. Instead of the NBA paying me to play\nbasketball, it pays me to plan some of its marketing strategy and tactics. Instead of sitting on the bench\nas a player (where I would probably be), I sit courtside as a spectator. To this day, the NBA\ncontinues as one of my best clients, and the dream continues. Entrepreneurs make their dreams happen\nin many ways, and my experience is a testament to that. Who knows? Maybe one day I will get to own\nan NBA franchise. How cool would that be!\n81) Make Difficult Sacrifices\nGreat achievement is usually born of great sacrifice.\n—Napoleon Hill, author, \nThink and Grow Rich\nKnowing he was a husband and a recent father, I asked an acquaintance, “How are your wife and\nnewborn son?” He hesitated before answering, and then he replied with a blank, emotionless face, “I\ngot a divorce.” I was caught off guard by his candid response. What I thought was a cordial inquiry\nsuddenly turned into an awkward social moment. I can’t remember exactly what I said afterward, but\nmy new friend continued talking about how his divorce was the right decision. Apparently, he and his\nex-wife had a major disagreement about his entrepreneurial drive and his need to be in Silicon Valley\nthousands of miles away from the East Coast. He talked about how he must go for the “billion-dollar\nidea” in order to leave his son a legacy. When he spoke I could tell that he was convinced that he was\nmaking the right decision. Only time will tell.\nAfter my conversation with a well-known Silicon Valley entrepreneur, I thought about my own\nwillingness to make difficult sacrifices in the name of chasing a big dream. A new husband and father\nmyself, I can’t imagine leaving my wife and young son to pursue a new business on the other side of\nthe country. The thought would never cross my mind. I wondered, if I were ever that convicted by the\npromise of a billion-dollar idea or a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, would I sacrifice my marriage\nand a relationship with my son? And, if I could, would I be able to live with myself? The answer is\nan emphatic no, but I know my wife, and she supports what I do 100 percent.\nSuch is the life of a dedicated entrepreneur who understands that in order to reach goals, there\nwill be sacrifices, some small and some large. Most entrepreneurs are willing to make small\nsacrifices. For example, giving up a few good meals for the proverbial ramen noodles is almost a rite\nof passage for the struggling entrepreneur. (I’ve certainly had my share of ramen noodles and wonder\nif there is a correlation between being an entrepreneur and having high blood pressure.) However,\nwhen it comes to making big sacrifices like giving up a high-paying job, a college education, good\nhealth, a family, and other important things, the dynamics of the discussion change. There seems to be\na split between regular entrepreneurs, who sacrifice little, and extreme entrepreneurs, who sacrifice a\nlot.\nIn general, you can measure how badly an entrepreneur wants an idea to become reality based on\nwhat that person is willing to sacrifice. Accordingly, one’s level of success is directly related to\nsacrifice. Keeping this in mind, I often ask prospective cofounders and staff for my companies what\nthey are willing to give up to be part of a winning team. They frequently give the expected answer: “I\nwould give my right arm!” But the fruits of their labor can be found in the pains of their sacrifice. I\ncan surmise the real answer before I ask the question by looking at what they have accomplished\nalready and what they have suffered to do it.\nEntrepreneurs have to sacrifice as they chase their dreams. However, rarely do we discuss just\nhow hard these sacrifices will be to reach high levels of success. We joke about eating ramen\nnoodles because it’s trivial. But would you leave a high-paying job? Would you drop out of college\neven if you had a full scholarship? Would you give up your health? Would you sacrifice your\nmarriage and a relationship with your son? Extreme entrepreneurs say yes to difficult questions like\nthese, and that’s what makes entrepreneurs a rare breed. As you embark on your journey to bring your\nbig idea to the world, ask yourself the question, \nWhat am I willing to sacrifice to make this happen?\nYour answer can help you determine your likelihood of success.\n82) You Have Unbelievable Endurance\nEndurance is one of the most difficult disciplines, but it is to the one who endures that the final victory comes.\n—Siddhartha Gautama, Indian philosopher, founder of Buddhism\nIf you want to know what it’s like to run a business, then run a marathon—seriously. Training for and\nrunning a marathon is the closest experience to starting and running a business. Interestingly, it turns\nout that not only are the two experiences extremely similar, but they also share a statistic that makes\ntheir likeness even more compelling.\nRecently, my curiosity inspired me to investigate how many people run a marathon (26.2 miles)\nor a half marathon (13.1 miles) annually and how many people start a business annually. In 2010, for\nexample, approximately 1.9 million people finished marathons or half marathons, according to\nRunning USA. That’s less than 1 percent of the U.S. population. Likewise, in 2010, 340 out of every\n100,000 adults started a business, according to the Kauffman Foundation. After adding the nonadult\npopulation back to the population figure to make the comparison more accurate, that’s a rate of less\nthan 1 percent of the U.S. population. Roughly the same percentage of those who put themselves\nthrough the challenging experience of running a marathon or a half marathon take the difficult plunge\nto start a business. One reason: Both are extreme in that they attract individuals who have a high\ntolerance for pain. Put another way, both require unbelievable endurance.\nInspired by my older brother, an extreme runner who has run around the world once and across\nthe United States twice, I began running half marathons in 2008. Considering how fast my brother\nwas, I had high hopes for my performance. I thought my four-year advantage in age would give me an\nedge, so I set my goal high from the start. I wanted to finish the half in 1 hour, 45 minutes. Well, let’s\njust say that I haven’t reached that goal. I didn’t think it would be easy to beat that time, but I sure\ndidn’t think it would be as hard. During my first race, I injured my leg at about mile 9 because I was\nrunning too fast, and I didn’t train properly. My time was 2:14:33. After that race, I adjusted my goal\nto breaking 2 hours. It would take me four races and over three years to reach that goal. In January\n2012 I not only broke two hours but I also crushed my goal time, finishing the race in 1:54:10. I beat\nmy next best time by a huge 10 minutes, a long time in long-distance running. Reflecting on my\npersonal best, I could trace the momentous achievement to my increased endurance training.\nSince taking up running in 2008, I’ve learned firsthand that running long distances and running a\nbusiness have many elements in common. Of the similarities, the most compelling is certainly the\nneed to have tremendous endurance in both to be successful. The need for endurance shows up in\nmany different aspects of each endeavor.\nWhen you are finally running the marathon, you have times when you just want to give up. You\nare overwhelmed by the long distance ahead or by how tired your body is. Sometimes I think to\nmyself, \nWhy on Earth am I doing this? What do I have to prove? Wouldn’t it be great to stop and\nrest?\n In the same way, when you are running a business, sometimes you want to throw in the towel.\nYou may be losing money, trying to build a working prototype, or dealing with a legal battle. You\nmay say to yourself, \nHaving a job is so much easier.\n Despite these roadblocks, you keep the end goal\nin mind and push through the difficulties, settling in on a good pace.\nAlso, the more you run, the better you become. After the terrible performance of my first race,\nmy brother told me that I’ll get better the more I run. I thought he said this just to cheer me up, but he\nwas right. The more I ran, the more I understood how my body reacts to different types of\nenvironments and training regimens. I learned how to avoid injury, what weather conditions I prefer,\nand how to maximize my workouts. I also received advice from elite runners on how to train, what to\neat, and what brand of clothes, shoes, and socks to wear. It made a huge difference in my performance\nand endurance. Likewise, the more businesses you start or the longer you are in business, the better\nyou become. In fact, according to a Harvard University study, first-time entrepreneurs have only an 18\npercent chance of succeeding; entrepreneurs who previously failed have a 20 percent chance of\nsucceeding.\nMoreover, long-term and consistent training properly prepares you for top performance. Running\na marathon is not something that you decide to do on a whim the day or week before. It requires the\ncommitment to train and to withstand the arduous preparation for the big run. Beginners need about\neighteen weeks to train for a full marathon and about twelve weeks for a half marathon. If the distance\nitself doesn’t deter people from running a marathon, than training almost every day of the week for\nmonths will do it. Similarly, if you start a business without any training, you will make many mistakes\nyou could have avoided completely. To prepare for business, your training regimen involves\nattending conferences, reading books and magazines, and finding a mentor.\nMore than any other characteristic of an entrepreneur, having superhuman endurance is by far the\nmost vital. It’s even more important than being smart, well-funded, or charismatic. Entrepreneurs who\nhave the fortitude to keep going despite being tired, to continue to educate themselves to be top\nperformers, and to work through long-lasting pain are the most likely to find success. Many people\nsay that running a business is like running a marathon. Having done both, I certainly agree.\n83) Be Prepared to Lose It All\nIf I didn’t make it in this world, I would probably be homeless. I gave myself that little to fall back on.\n—Shawn Wayans, actor, producer\nI sat alone in my apartment staring at the wall in front of me. I wondered how I was going to make\nends meet. My company wasn’t making any money at the time, and my pride prevented me from asking\nfor help. I was at an all-time low, and I had no one to talk to about it. I felt miserable and extremely\nlonely.\nDuring the next few days, I carried on as usual and hung out with friends to try and lighten my\nspirits. I was good at hiding my feelings of despair. Besides, I felt like I had to act normally because\nmy friends and family thought I was rich. They had no clue that I could barely pay my rent and other\nbasic bills. If I had mentioned my financial struggles, they wouldn’t have believed me. In their\nopinion, I was one of the many young dotcom superstars prevalent in the media during the time. In\nother words, they thought that I was well-off enough to retire at the age of twenty-one. They would\nnever believe that I was on the verge of losing it all, including my own mind.\nI eventually overcame my low point, but it was a difficult learning experience. It was the first of\na few times when I felt like giving up because the pressure and stress were so great. However, each\ncrucible has prepared me to better deal with challenging times. Despite the emotional strain and\ntremendous stress, I was determined to remain an entrepreneur. Every time, I was able to come out on\ntop and to grow more comfortable with my ability to avert disaster, but it doesn’t always happen that\nway for everybody.\nRarely do entrepreneurs talk about how bad times can get. If we do talk about them, we gloss\nover them, minimizing and maybe even making light of the experiences. We joke about eating ramen\nnoodles or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. We laugh about not having any money to pay bills or\nmessing up our credit. All of these experiences are much easier to talk about once they have passed,\nand we find ourselves in a position of relative comfort.\nInstead of avoiding the difficult conversation or glossing over it, remember every now and then\njust how depressing times can get. Contrary to popular and glorified belief, even as an entrepreneur\nyou sometimes won’t know where your next dollar is coming from. You may consider filing\nbankruptcy. You may feel like you have to role-play among friends and family who admire your\nentrepreneurial courage and envy your fictitious bank account. You’ll have days when you just want\nto curl up in a ball and sleep your worries away. In the pursuit of their business dreams,\nentrepreneurs have sacrificed marriages, family time, financial stability, health, and the list goes on.\nWhile I will always be an entrepreneur and I tout the many wonderful reasons I choose to be an\nentrepreneur, I know that this is the hardest thing that I have ever done in my life. I also know that a\nlot of what we see in the media is hype. Not every entrepreneur is making lots of money and living the\nperfect life. At no point do I want to give people a one-sided view of entrepreneurship, because it’s\nnot reality. Entrepreneurship is not for the weak. If you aren’t prepared to lose it all, then you should\ndefinitely do something else.\nChapter 7\nMotivation\nPeople often say that \nmotivation\n doesn’t last. Well, neither\ndoes \nbathing\n—that’s why we recommend it daily.\n—Zig Ziglar, author, motivational speaker\nThe word “motivation” in a business context often conjures up images of a room full of\ncorporate managers getting an expensive pep talk from motivational speakers like Zig Ziglar and Les\nBrown. But motivation comes in several different forms, many of which are subtle and even\nsubconscious. As an entrepreneur, you must be keenly aware of what motivates you to ensure that\nyour maximum effort is sustainable.\nIn this chapter, you learn about what motivates the most successful entrepreneurs, ranging from\ngetting fired to wanting to create the best possible product on the market. You learn some of the signs\n—some of which may surprise you—that your motivation is well-placed or misplaced. Hopefully,\nthese stories, statistics, and beliefs are motivational in themselves. Ultimately, you should align your\nmotivation with your business goals, a challenging but attainable feat.\n84) Being Successful Is Not the Goal\nNothing recedes like success.\n—Walter Winchell, newspaper and radio gossip commentator\nIn 2009, Canadian recording artist Drake released “Successful,” the second single from his third\nrelease, titled \nSo Far Gone\n. The song has a melodic and a catchy chorus: “I just wanna be, I just\nwanna be successful.” The same lyric is repeated over and over as if it were a religious chant. Drake\nglorifies what he believes is the life of a successful person, craving money, cars, women, clothes, and\nawards. As I heard the song for the first time, I certainly could relate to the twenty-three-year-old’s\ndesire to be successful. But as someone seven years his senior I couldn’t help to think how being\nsuccessful is such a frivolous goal and how desiring accolades, possessions, and cheap\ncompanionship won’t bring long-lasting joy.\nI often mentor or cross paths with people who think that being an entrepreneur is one of the\nfastest ways to become successful or to gain respect. They see the media frenzy surrounding\nFacebook’s IPO or Instagram’s billion-dollar acquisition; they watch their favorite music artists and\nactors in the limelight, making millions of dollars. The pressure to be respected by peers and to live a\nsuccessful lifestyle is especially prevalent among members of generation Y. In fact, according to a\nrecent study from the University of Oregon, the desire for respect as a core value has risen\ntremendously over the levels of previous years. The study’s lead author, Eda Gurel-Atay, said, “We\nfound that people want respect for themselves and they want to be important to other people.” This\nincreased value is quite evident in social media, as the heightened desire for respect and importance\noften turns into embellished and narcissistic posts on Facebook. Unfortunately, the motivation of these\nposts, like Drake’s song, is a belief that true success comes from status, not from self-actualization.\nA true entrepreneur is not driven by outward appearances of success, but rather by solving a\nproblem whose solution provides value to its customers. This dedication shows up time and time\nagain among high achievers in business, and it’s most evident among those who despite their great\nwealth and accomplishments continue to live a modest lifestyle. For example, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO\nof Facebook, was a renter for years even though he was worth billions of dollars. His commitment to\nFacebook’s original goal of enhancing human communication was reiterated in his speech on the day\nhis company went public: “Our mission isn’t to be a public company. Our mission is to make the\nworld more open and connected.” He could have cashed out years ago, but his concept of being\nsuccessful is making his idea a complete reality, or in other words, attaining self-actualization.\nMany serial entrepreneurs learn the value of self-actualization after the first exit. After reaching\na point in my life where I thought I was successful, this feeling didn’t last very long. Although other\npeople continued to think I was successful, I didn’t go on feeling that way. I had sold my first\ncompany and was off to starting the next one. I learned that what matters most to me isn’t so much\nreceiving the rewards of a highly profitable company as much as it is solving problems, building\nvaluable companies, and making an impact in the world. Yes, it may sound lofty, but it’s the reason I\nget up every morning and the measure by which I determine my success.\nThere’s nothing wrong with wanting to be successful, but it is the wrong reason to start a\nbusiness. Starting a business to be successful is like getting married to have sex. People too often\nfocus on the benefits of the undertaking rather than the true purpose. If you remember to focus on your\npurpose—unadulterated by any ulterior motives—you stay headed in the right direction to accomplish\nyour goal, and the benefits of your efforts are more likely to accrue to you. I like how Dave Navarro,\n“the Launch Coach,” put it: “Success is not a person. It’s an event.”\n85) You Are Excited When Monday Morning Arrives\nIt’s just another manic Monday\nI wish it were Sunday\n’Cause that’s my funday\nMy I-don’t-have-to-runday\nIt’s just another manic Monday\n—Lyrics from “Manic Monday,” The Bangles\n“Manic Monday,” the catchy song that debuted in 1986 by American pop rock band the Bangles and\nwritten by Prince, describes the weekly angst of so many people who get up to go to work on a\nMonday morning. Although I was only six years old in 1986, I remember the song’s melody well and\ncan still recite some of the lyrics by heart. As a toddler, I had no idea what the song meant. I just\nknew there was something peculiar about a Monday. Soon enough, though, I was able to relate to the\nsong: Just a few months later, Monday morning meant time to go to school, and that’s no more fun than\nhaving to go to work.\nThe Bangles’s song became a hit because so many people could relate to it. Everyone at some\npoint in life has had Monday morning woes. While the song describes a common anxiety in a fun,\nlighthearted way, the matter of Monday mania is much more serious than you might think.\nA disproportionate number of heart attacks occur on Monday mornings. The reason? People are\nso stressed out about going to work on Monday that their blood pressure levels skyrocket, increasing\nthe likelihood of a heart attack. A study conducted by Japan’s Tokyo Women’s Medical University\nand published in the \nAmerican Journal of Hypertension\n in 2005 proves that having a job can be\ndevastating to your health. So much for the matter being lighthearted!\nIn contrast to this gloomy and depressing reality for millions of Americans, one group of people\nactually loves Monday mornings. These people neither have a theme song written by a huge rock star\nnor a published medical study about how little stress they have. Who are these rare people?\nEntrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs love Mondays. Why? Several reasons, but here are two of my favorites:\n1. \nMondays represent a rebirth.\n Working on a Monday is like hitting the reset button. Most\nentrepreneurs work nonstop, so Mondays—if for no other reason than being the first workday of the\nweek—represent a time to restart and to refocus.\n2. \nMondays are business as usual.\n On Monday, the world seems to be functioning in its totality\nonce again. People are back in their offices. They return calls. They return e-mails. Because it’s an\nofficial workday, people feel more obligated to get back to you. And if you are in sales or\nnegotiations, nothing is worse than the weekend killing your momentum. You can’t conquer the world\nif it stops for two days.\nThose of you who are already entrepreneurs probably nod your heads in agreement. On the other\nhand, those of you who are working a 9-to-5 and have entrepreneurial dreams find it hard to believe\nthat anyone would love a Monday morning. This segment is for you. But don’t worry about actively\ntrying to assume this characteristic. It’s automatic.\nAn entrepreneur who dreads Mondays is probably not an entrepreneur for the right reasons. If\nyou need a litmus test to see if your motivation is where it needs to be, this is it. Put another way, if\nyou are an entrepreneur and you don’t like Mondays, it’s probably time to do something else. How\nyou feel on this critical day is so important. After all, it could be a matter of life or death—literally.\n86) You’re Disappointed When Friday Arrives\nI hate weekends because there is no stock market.\n—Rene Rivkin, Australian stockbroker, entrepreneur\nA few months ago on a Monday morning, I updated my Facebook status with the following: “I\nabsolutely love Mondays. Not so thrilled about Fridays.” I anticipated some lighthearted criticism\nfrom my friends, but I didn’t think that my sanity would be questioned. One of my neighbors\ncommented, “You are crazy, man.” I didn’t take offense, though. As shocking and direct as his\ncomment was, he had a point.\nWhile most people understand why I love Mondays, they don’t understand why I dislike Fridays.\nThey think that everyone loves Fridays. Even if you work for yourself or run a business, Friday is the\nday that ends the arduous workweek, signaling leisure time for going to parties, sleeping in, working\nout, running errands, spending time with family, and doing many other things that are fun. How could\nyou not like Fridays, right?\nThe joy of Friday is ingrained in our culture. For example, countless songs are about Friday and\nits happy significance. Perhaps the most popular is “Friday on My Mind” by the Easybeats, an\nAustralian rock-and-roll band from the 1960s. The lyrics of the song include this sentiment, “Nothing\nelse that bugs me more than workin’ for the rich man.” For both the writer of this lyric and millions of\ndisgruntled workers, Friday represents freedom, albeit temporary, from the man. Likewise, we have\nexpressions like T.G.I.F. (Thank God/Goodness It’s Friday), after which a popular chain of\nrestaurants is named. Happy hours are especially lively on Fridays. Anything less than praise for\nFridays and all they represent is darn near sacrilegious. For some, Friday is more sacred than the\nSabbath.\nWell, the Friday worshippers will just have to burn me at the stake, because I am the anti-\nFriday. Fridays are my hell. I am especially tetchy on that day, and my morale is low. Sometimes I\neven go several hours without eating. I am exhausted trying to motivate team members who have their\nmind on dashing out of the office. I am simply a depressed mess.\nI find that other entrepreneurs are like me on Fridays for numerous reasons; three are common.\nFirst, \nFriday is in large part a useless day.\n Employee productivity goes way down. According to a\nsurvey by Accountemps, a staffing and temp agency, Fridays are the least productive day of the\nworkweek by far. No surprise here. Second, \nit’s payday\n—for everybody else. There’s no stress like\nhaving trouble meeting payroll. While everyone is feeling like a fat cat, you feel like a skinny dog.\nThird, \nyou have to wait an entire two days to get anything done.\n Most entrepreneurs are always\nworking. That’s the life we choose and love, but it’s especially frustrating when you have those same\nunrealistic and demanding expectations for everyone else.\nFriday might as well be “Cryday.” And there is no happy hour, just “unhappy hour.” Such are the\nlives of entrepreneurs, full of strange dichotomies: We like Mondays while everyone else likes\nFridays; we like to work while everyone else plays; we write checks while everyone else gets paid.\nDon’t get me wrong. I am not complaining. In fact, I think my Facebook friend was right. I \nam\n crazy.\nBut I like being crazy—crazy rich, that is, even if it means hating Fridays.\n87) A 9-to-5 Is Worse Than Death\nA real job is a job you hate.\n—Bill Watterson, cartoonist, author\nEvery day, to make ends meet, millions of Americans go to a job they hate. Every day, I make ends\nmeet to avoid going to a job I would hate. While the average employee hopes he never gets fired, I\nhope I never get hired. Most employees have to fight just to get a small raise; I am an entrepreneur\nbecause it makes no sense to place a limit on my income. Many people find self-worth in\nemployment; I find self-worth in entrepreneurship. This is my reality, and although it’s not normal, I\nthink it’s most natural.\nDon’t get me wrong. I have much respect for people who do what it takes to earn an income to\nsupport themselves or their family. I can somewhat relate. I have worked some jobs that were terrible\n—for me, anyway. For example, I once worked a seasonal job at Macy’s, and I thought I was going to\ndie. I had to get up at 4:30 a.m. to sell watches and push consumer credit cards, standing all day and\npleasing some of the most discourteous customers. Each day I came home wondering how people did\nthis type of work for years. Having to stand and watch the time all day seemed like cruel and unusual\npunishment, not a job. When the Christmas season ended, I was eager to return to my old self.\nAs ridiculous as it sounds, I actually have a very real fear of having to work a 9-to-5. In fact, I\nfear it more than death itself. The fear is so intense that I often have nightmares about it. Upon further\nanalysis of my fear, a trained psychologist would probably determine that I am not scared about a job\nper se. Instead, I am more terrified of failure. The job is just an outward sign of what would be a\ncrushing inner defeat. Having a job would mean that I was unable to continue my life as an\nentrepreneur full-time, doing what I find most fulfilling. In this respect, I am like everyone else who\nrates fear of failure as one of their biggest phobias.\nWe often hear the popular phrase “No fear!” In fact, it’s a popular selling t-shirt. The\nphenomenon is a great example of how our culture glorifies an unattainable reality in which we fear\nnothing. Fear is the ultimate enemy that we must conquer. Well, I beg to differ. In some cases, fear is\ngood. If, like I do, you fear having a 9-to-5 job, you are motivated to do all you can to avoid it. So far,\nthings have worked out well for me.\nEntrepreneurs are often touted for being fearless. This perception is not reality, though.\nEntrepreneurs are human and have fears like everyone else. Most likely, having a job is one of those\nfears, but we just channel that fear into something constructive like motivation or the courage to excel.\nWhen healthy fear is combined with a greater desire to succeed, nothing can stop you.\n88) Your Parents Want You to Get a Real Job with Benefits\nMy son is now an “entrepreneur.” That’s what you’re called when you don’t have a job.\n—Ted Turner, founder, CNN; businessman; philanthropist\nIt was too late. How could I have been so careless and left the letter sitting on my bureau? My mother,\nwhose curiosity often has no regard for her children’s privacy, had the letter in her hand. I don’t think\nthat she read the whole thing before sprinting to show it to my father. I am almost sure she stopped\nreading around the third paragraph of the two-page letter that stated, “Your initial compensation will\nbe $55,000 per year. . . . If you decide to accept employment with us, we will pay you a signing\nbonus in the amount of $5,000 payable upon acceptance.” Oh no! My parents found out what I had\nhoped they never would.\nThat Christmas holiday in 2000, I was barely a senior in college and had just turned twenty\nyears old. Three weeks before I went home for the break, I received an offer letter from one of the\nthen Big 5 consulting firms, but hadn’t read it. I was not interested in reading it, because I had no\nintention of actually taking the job—no matter how much money the company offered me. Over the\nholiday, I finally decided to read the letter. The package was worth over $80,000 in 2012 dollars, not\nincluding benefits.\nThe first thing that my father said to me after finding out about the job offer took me by surprise.\nHe grumbled, “Even after working for the same company for over thirty years, I don’t even get twenty\ndays of paid vacation.” After his comment, I felt a bit guilty for having blown off the offer. I knew\nafter that awkward encounter that he and my mother wanted me to accept the offer, which symbolized\nthe summation of all their efforts. I felt like the golden child. I had received a full ride to college, and\nnow I had an incredible job offer during what pundits said was one of the worst job markets for\ncollege graduates in years. Still, I wanted to take a different path, a more exciting adventure that I\nthought would lead me to true self-actualization.\nMy parents eventually accepted my decision to pursue entrepreneurship 100 percent. After that\nChristmas holiday they never really pushed me get a “real job.” I thank them for that. Perhaps their\nsupport comes from having full confidence in me to accomplish my goals. I suppose it helped, too,\nthat I was able to take care of myself from day one with little help from them. The funny thing is that\nnowadays my mother, who still believes that a corporate job is the highest form of security and social\nprestige, often asks me with a tone of motherly concern, “How is your business?” As I have during the\nlast twelve years, I reassure her, saying, “It’s going well.” For some reason, I don’t think my answer\nlessens her concern, especially since I have a family now. My dad doesn’t say much, although I know\nhe’s supportive.\nIf your parents want you to get a real job, be patient with them. Of course, they have your best\ninterest at heart. I am just over thirty years old, and I think they would still like for me to get a real\njob. It’s just the expectation of their generation, and anything outside the norm is a huge risk. In many\nways, they are right. We all know that more businesses fail than succeed. As for you, the best thing to\ndo is to work hard to build a business that is profitable and highly successful. Perhaps write them a\ncheck every now and then. How can they not be proud of that?\nIn case you were wondering what company offered me the job, it was Arthur Andersen, the\nconsulting firm that no longer exists. The firm went down with Enron in one of the largest accounting\nscandals and financial disasters in history. Enron declared bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. Had I\naccepted their offer I would have been unemployed in just a few months.\nIn another strange twist of fate, my father was recently forced into semiretirement by a company\nfor which he’d worked for almost forty years. The company let him and other highly experienced\nexecutives go in a less than honorable way that not even he could have imagined. Who knows? Maybe\nthis is a good thing. Now I can encourage him to become an entrepreneur.\n89) You Sometimes Get More Resentment Than Respect\nEntrepreneurs are the forgotten heroes of America.\n—Ronald Reagan, fortieth president, United States of America\nWhen you become an entrepreneur, you don’t receive a superhero outfit with a big “E” on the front of\nit. Although you are indeed superhuman—having taken an ocean-sized leap that many would never\nconsider, having solved complex problems, and having turned a passion into profit—the ordinary\nperson doesn’t value your superpowers. And when you become successful, Gotham won’t throw you\na party to thank you for helping to save the economy; it will probably just send you a higher tax bill.\nTo most people, you are the same person you always were. You are far from being a superhero on an\nelite team like the Avengers, fighting and squashing unemployment, recessions, and\nunderdevelopment. In fact, some people consider you to be more like a villain than a savior.\nPart of the recent blame for this lack of appreciation is the poor economy. Entrepreneurship has\nnow been proposed as the panacea for our economic ills. As more and more economists and\ngovernment officials believe that encouraging entrepreneurship at its basic level is a partial solution\nto getting our economy going again, entrepreneurship has lost some of its prestige and allure. It has\nbecome a romantic, bureaucratic last resort to help people who have no jobs. In a few states,\nprograms to spur entrepreneurship appear just as the reserves for unemployment benefits near\ndepletion. Sadly, it has come to this: Being an entrepreneur has become a euphemism for being\nunemployed. Being an entrepreneur has even been associated with being lazy. Instead of\nentrepreneurship being a badge of accomplishment, it has become a stigma of shame. The good thing\nis that this attitude will likely change as the economy improves, but people resent entrepreneurs for\ntwo other long-standing reasons.\n1. \nJealousy is perhaps the most common reason that entrepreneurs do not get the respect they\ndeserve, especially from people close to them.\n As if watching an embellished Facebook feed,\nresentful spectators are envious of some entrepreneurs’ amazing lifestyles. They don’t see the hard\nwork that goes into making that lifestyle possible. It takes superhero-like confidence and gumption to\nbecome an entrepreneur—and everyone knows this. Entrepreneurs are extremely rare, comprising\nless than 1 percent of the overall U.S. population. Despite these facts, people are always jealous of\nthose who take the risks to do something great, and jealousy often manifests itself as resentment.\n2. \nEntrepreneurs receive disrespect because they are no longer on the corporate grid or part\nof the matrix\n. As a result, people cannot necessarily put them into a nice box labeled “lawyer,”\n“mechanic,” or “secretary.” For them, there is an unsettling mystery about what entrepreneurs do, how\nthey spend their time, where they go, and so on. They wonder how they make ends meet. People who\nare class conscious especially have difficulty because they have no idea how much money an\nentrepreneur makes. They want to discover who makes more money so that they can assuage the\nanxiety of their curiosity. In general, people are afraid of and dismissive of what they don’t\nunderstand or know; unfortunately, that includes entrepreneurs.\nAn upside is that entrepreneurs who encounter such resentment often turn it into a powerful\nmotivator. In the same way that a superhero may be motivated to disprove a naysayer, an entrepreneur\nis inspired to silence resentment toward entrepreneurship, and even personal attacks. Superheroes\nand entrepreneurs do what must be done regardless. Ultimately, they know that resentment and respect\nare not mutually exclusive.\n90) It’s Not about Being Your Own Boss\n“Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American Dream?”\n—Homer Simpson, in \nThe Simpsons\nFor a moment, it seemed as if the message was everywhere—on television, on radio, in countless\nTwitter and Facebook messages. Every day, I heard someone or saw some advertisement touting the\ngreatest benefit of entrepreneurship. What was this great benefit? Well, it wasn’t how pursuing\nentrepreneurship can possibly make you wealthy. Nor was it that entrepreneurship is the key to true\nindependence. Instead, entrepreneurship enables you to “be your own boss.” How lame! Above all,\nhow deceiving!\nThis clever pitch appeals to those who have a job and want to escape from their boss, but can’t.\nThat would be like persuading a prisoner to break out of jail because then he could be his own\nwarden. Why would you want to be your own boss, someone you despise?\nBeing your own boss is not the right reason to pursue entrepreneurship for two reasons.\n1. \nThe phrase “being your own boss” appeals to those who believe that a domineering boss is\na bad thing.\n They crave the freedom to do what they want when they want. People with this attitude\ngenerally make terrible entrepreneurs. As many entrepreneurs will tell you, unless you have strong\nself-discipline, a demanding boss figure that keeps you on track to success is a great thing, whether\nit’s yourself, an investor, a mentor, or a board. One thing is for sure: In order to be a successful\nentrepreneur, discipline is a must. There is no escaping it.\n2. \nThe misguided “be your own boss” pitch appeals to a false idea of what being an\nentrepreneur means.\n It implies that to be an entrepreneur is to be a manager. Not true. Author and\nentrepreneurial guru Michael Gerber put it best in his classic book, \nThe E Myth.\n He explains that\nthree types of people go into business: the entrepreneur, the manager, and the technician. Gerber\nwrites,\nThe entrepreneurial personality turns the most trivial condition into an exceptional\nopportunity. The Entrepreneur is the visionary in us. The dreamer. The energy behind every\nhuman activity. The energy that sparks the fire of the future. The catalyst for change . . . to\nthe entrepreneur, most people are problems that get in the way of the dream.\nOn the other hand, a boss or The Manager is pragmatic. Gerber continues, “Without The Manager\nthere would be no planning, no order, no predictability. . . . Without The Manager, there could be no\nbusiness, no society.” An entrepreneur is not a manager.\nI would be much happier if those “be your own boss” ads never mentioned entrepreneurship.\nIdeally, they would proclaim, “Own your own business!” and stop there. The Entrepreneur, as Gerber\nputs it, “builds a house and the instant it’s done begins planning the next one.” Entrepreneurs aren’t\ninterested in being bosses at all, and if an entrepreneur has to be a boss, this role is most certainly\ntemporary.\nPeople who subscribe to the be-your-own-boss fallacy cripple their entrepreneurial potential\nand are in it for the wrong reason. Are you a boss or an entrepreneur?\n91) Entrepreneurship Is in Your Blood, Literally\nInspiration comes from all different places.\n—Jeffrey Katzenberg, CEO, DreamWorks Animation\nOprah Winfrey is known for making guests on her show cry. However, this time, she was the one who\nwould shed tears, overcome by the significance and serendipity of the moment.\nIn 2007 I stumbled upon a television special titled \nOprah’s Roots: An African American Lives\nSpecial\n, in which producer Henry Louis Gates Jr. revealed shocking news to Winfrey about her\nfamily history. Gates, head of Harvard’s Afro-American Studies program, researched Winfrey’s\nfamily history extensively and decided to share what he found in a television special. The revelation\nwas astonishing.\nGates shared that Winfrey’s great-great-grandfather, a former slave, bought a large amount of\nland and built on it a school for African American children. Considering the times, this achievement\nwas extraordinary. When Winfrey learned this amazing piece of history, she was speechless. Tears\ncame to her eyes. A blank stare turned into a confident smile. Winfrey, whose passions are education\nand land, instantly made the connection to her trailblazing ancestor. Like him, she built a school for\nyoung children and owns quite a bit of land. Oprah found renewed meaning and validation of her\npurpose in life. (Coincidentally, my wife and I went horseback riding on Winfrey’s land in Hana,\nHawaii, in 2008. We learned then that her land there was one of several properties that she owns\naround the world.)\nWhile watching the television special, I couldn’t help but get emotional, too. I felt tremendous\njoy for Winfrey and hope for myself that someday I would find someone in my family who was a\ntrailblazing entrepreneur. As a young entrepreneur I struggled to find positive affirmation from my\nfamily that entrepreneurship was an honorable and legitimate path. Having a network of friends and\nassociates who are entrepreneurs is wonderful, but having supportive family members—extended or\nimmediate—makes a difference.\nMy older brother was the closest to an entrepreneur. Having graduated from Berklee College of\nMusic in Boston and traveled the world playing jazz piano with Wynton Marsalis and Herbie\nHancock, he was in charge of finding his band’s gigs, booking the band, and paying band members.\nHe created a company through which he produced his CDs and managed his piano-tuning\nappointments. Other than my brother, no one in my immediate family was close to being an\nentrepreneur. On both sides of my extended family, everyone worked a normal 9-to-5 job.\nI would later find out just how rare entrepreneurs are. According to the Kauffman Foundation,\nAtlanta ranked second among top metro areas in 2011 in the creation of new business. In 2011, 500\nout of 100,000 adults ages twenty to sixty-four started a business. Los Angeles was the top city with\n580 out of 100,000. That’s approximately 0.58 percent in the most entrepreneurial city in the United\nStates. No wonder it’s so hard to find a family member who’s an entrepreneur.\nMy paternal grandmother was born in 1912. I never thought that she would be the link to connect\nme to relatives who owned their own businesses. When encouraging my siblings and me to watch a\nvideo of my grandmother talking about her life, my father mentioned that she had a brother who\nowned a grocery store. After asking my dad to tell me more, I learned that my uncle Thomas and uncle\nDan were my enterprising great-uncles. Uncle Thomas would deliver groceries with his horse and\nbuggy, while Uncle Dan would make trips to the coal mines in Pennsylvania to collect coal to sell in\nBaltimore. After learning this, I didn’t come to tears like Oprah, but I searched for and found a\nconnection. I wasn’t so odd after all.\nChoosing to be an entrepreneur can be a lonely endeavor and experience, especially if no one in\nyour family is one. But I encourage you to do a little research on your family, and chances are you\nwill find someone who took the same risks that you did. Just like Oprah Winfrey and me, you will\nfind that one brave family member who gives you extra inspiration and makes you proud. As the\ncharacter Charlotte Phelan said in the Academy Award–winning movie \nThe Help\n, “Courage\nsometimes skips a generation.”\n92) You Know Your Worth\nSelf-worth comes from one thing—thinking that you are worthy.\n—Wayne Dyer, self-help author, motivational speaker\nJohn looked me square in the eyes and with a stern face and faint whisper shared a disturbing secret.\nHis revelation threw me for a loop. He warned, “They hire and pay very well the computer science\nmajors who go to Georgia Tech. All the interns from other schools are paid lower wages and given\nlower positions. Many of them are just happy to be here, so they work for free or take crumbs. Don’t\nlet that happen to you. Make sure they pay you what you’re worth.” John was a veteran intern with the\ncompany and a senior at Georgia Tech. His information was precise. When I was offered the job, I\ntook his advice and negotiated a good salary. John and I would become good friends.\nAbout a year earlier at another internship in Boston, my mentor told me to avoid taking entry-\nlevel jobs if I knew I could do more challenging work. Specifically, he admonished me, saying,\n“Whatever you do, don’t take a QA job. You are good enough to be a software developer. If you start\nat the QA level, you’ll be typecast, and it will take you longer to move up the ranks to developer.”\nQA stands for Quality Assurance and describes the job of those who test the programs that\ndevelopers write. QAs would much rather write code than test it. I was a freshman when I received\nthis advice. It was my first exposure to the absurdity of the caste system in many large technology\ncompanies.\nI eventually left the job that John helped me get in Atlanta. Corporate politics and egos began to\ninhibit my growth, and I was not willing to wait around until things improved. I also became\nfrustrated working for someone who made multiple times as much as I did. I knew that my talents\nwere worth more than any company was willing to pay me. A few months after I left the job, I\nfounded my company.\nWhat does this have to do with being an entrepreneur? If you are currently still working, it means\neverything. So many potential entrepreneurs don’t know their worth. They are paralyzed by their\ncomfort, unwilling to maximize their true potential. If only they would wake up and realize that their\nsalary is only a fraction of what they could earn as entrepreneurs. Fortunately, I woke up early.\nOnce you have taken the leap to become an entrepreneur and you have been in business for a\nwhile, knowing your worth takes on another meaning. At this point, it’s not about \nyour\n worth\nnecessarily; it’s about your company’s worth. There is no better example of someone who understood\nhis company’s worth than Mark Zuckerberg, cofounder and CEO of Facebook.\nMark Zuckerberg’s company had several opportunities to be acquired once it really began to\ngrow. For example, Viacom offered $75 million to buy the entire company in 2005. It wanted to\ncombine Thefacebook, as it was called then, with MTV.com. As chronicled in David Kirkpatrick’s\nbook \nThe\n \nFacebook\n \nEffect\n, “If Zuckerberg accepted such an offer, he would have put about $35\nmillion in his pocket for a year’s work. But that didn’t matter to him.” Most of us would have taken\nthe offer. Zuckerberg thought his company would be a billion-dollar company someday. Seven years\nlater, Facebook’s valuation was estimated to be $75 billion right before it went public. Yes, that’s\nbillion with a “b.”\nWhether you are contemplating leaving your job or entertaining offers for the purchase of your\ncompany, it takes guts to hold your ground to get what you believe you or your company is worth. You\nhave to understand that things do not always work in your favor, but when they do, it’s all worth it.\nDon’t take it from me. Just ask Mark Zuckerberg.\n93) You Can’t Keep a Job\nI didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. . . . It freed\nme to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.\n—Steve Jobs, cofounder, Apple\nI have never been able to keep a job for more than five months. I have had five jobs and internships in\nmy life, and most have ended faster than it took to actually secure the opportunity. Most of the jobs\nwere summer internships or short-term positions, but a few were long-term, 9-to-5 jobs. Regardless, I\nfigured out early in life that having a traditional job wasn’t for me. Little did I know that my nomadic\nexperience was typical of a budding entrepreneur.\nAccording to a recent study by LinkedIn, a professional social networking site with over 100\nmillion public profiles, entrepreneurs stayed at previous jobs for about 2.5 years compared to the\nnational average of 4.4 years. The study reveals the restless nature of entrepreneurs who cannot stay\nin any position too long. The desire to move on can come from several sources.\nFor me, the restlessness came from the inability to drop my own projects. I always had an idea\nor business that I was developing, and that was my priority. I felt that working a job instead of\nworking on my own business was a bad choice. No matter how enticing the job was, I always ended\nup choosing my own projects. Even when my employer allowed me to work on my own projects, I\neventually left because work was taking away from the precious time I could devote to pursuing my\nown ideas. Having a job was not helping me to grow. It was nothing more than a paycheck and a\nsense of financial security. For most people, that’s enough, but I wanted something different,\nsomething more.\nSome of the most famous entrepreneurs couldn’t keep a job either. One of my favorite reject\nstories is how billionaire Mark Cuban, founder of MicroSolutions and owner of the NBA’s Dallas\nMavericks, was fired from his job as a computer salesman. When Cuban failed to open the store on\ntime, his manager fired him immediately. It was Cuban’s last job. In fact, Walt Disney, Oprah\nWinfrey, Michael Bloomberg, J. K. Rowling, Thomas Edison, Bernie Marcus, and Arthur Blank were\nall fired, too, before they became fearless entrepreneurs. They would all go on to build billion-dollar\nenterprises. Many of these moguls still identify getting fired as one of the best things that ever\nhappened to them and believe that the experience ignited in them a fire to follow their own path to\nsuccess.\nThere are many signs that you are an entrepreneur, but not being able to keep a job for long is\nperhaps the biggest sign. If you can’t hold down a job, the cosmos may be trying to tell you something.\nInstead of running from job to job, run full force into your entrepreneurial destiny. I did, and I have\nhad a “job” for over twelve years straight.\n94) You Cry When Things Don’t Go Your Way\nDisappointment is an endless wellspring of comedy inspiration.\n—Martin Freeman, English actor\nThere’s no crying in business! Well, that’s what I thought until I read the Steve Jobs biography that\ncame out shortly after his death.\nTo my surprise, it seemed like Jobs cried about everything that didn’t go his way. For example,\nwhen Jobs was forced out of Apple, the very company he founded, he cried. Apple’s board at the\ntime decided to support John Scully as CEO and planned to reduce Jobs’s role in the company.\nWalter Isaacson, author of the biography, wrote, “He [Jobs] went back to his office, gathered his\nlongtime loyalists on the Macintosh staff, and started to cry.” This was just one of several examples\nthroughout the book of Jobs crying. A few of the reasons are somewhat justified—like getting kicked\nout of the billion-dollar company you started—but others seem especially frivolous. Jobs also cried\nwhen cofounder Steve Wozniak was deemed employee number one and he was not. He cried when\nsome of his best employees left the company. He cried when negotiations didn’t go his way. He cried\nwhen his team had design problems. I think you get the watery picture.\nI was quick to judge Jobs, but then I remembered that I, too, have cried when things have not\ngone my way in business. The first and most emotional breakdown took place when I was twenty-\nfive, and a major investment fell through at the last minute. I felt like my world was ending, so I cried.\nThis wasn’t a dignified weep when tears slowly well up and finally pour from your eyes, streaming\ngracefully down your cheeks, when you still have control over your body. No, it was much worse. I\ncried so hard that I sounded like a toddler who could barely breathe. Mucus was coming out of my\nnose, and my body jolted rhythmically during inhalation to keep up with the outpouring of raw\nemotion. Luckily, my supportive girlfriend was there to console, hold, and pray for me and tell me\nthat everything would be just fine. I eventually recovered and felt better because of the waterworks.\nWhen I recalled this incident, I smiled because I knew that Jobs and I were so passionate about\nour businesses that we couldn’t help but express in the most natural way how an adverse situation\naffected us. Many entrepreneurs internalize their unhappy emotions so as to appear invulnerable.\nThere certainly is a place for that. However, sometimes a good cry is what a CEO needs to move on\nand to overcome whatever has happened.\nEveryone talks about how entrepreneurs should be passionate. However, they rarely talk about\nbeing passionate in the most comprehensive sense. Passion manifests itself in different forms, from\nworking long hours to yelling at members of your team, from having youthful enthusiasm to even\ncrying when something doesn’t go your way. If you feel the urge to cry every now and then about an\nissue related to your business, go ahead and cry. It’s quite alright. Many entrepreneurs in the world\nhave cried about their businesses. They just aren’t honest enough to admit it like Jobs and me.\n95) It’s Never Too Late to Be an Entrepreneur\nYou are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.\n—C. S. Lewis, author, theologian\n“I’m too old to start a business,” said my forty-four-year-old friend when I encouraged her to become\nan entrepreneur. I shook my head as she rambled on about how she has too many responsibilities and\nhow she’s not as creative as she used to be. Her excuses were ridiculous, but all too common for\npeople her age.\nAs the media focus on young CEOs like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Instagram’s Kevin\nSystrom, it is easy to assume that most companies these days are started by teenagers and people in\ntheir twenties. Consequently, many older people buy into this media hype and think that starting a\ncompany is for young people, accepting that their chances of success are limited by their age. This\nassumption and the media hype couldn’t be further from the truth.\nFirst, the media hype is heavily focused on the technology sector, which tends to glorify young\nsuperstars. When it comes to what is most appealing to the media, the new social media company\nalways overshadows the new bakery on Main Street. However, most new businesses in the United\nStates aren’t tech-related and sexy. They will be primarily sole proprietorships and small businesses\nwith fewer than five employees. Most of their owners will be old enough to be a tech guru’s mother\nor father.\nSecond, older people are starting more businesses than people in their teens and twenties.\nAccording to a Kauffman Foundation study, Americans between the ages of thirty-five and forty-four\nrepresented the largest increase in entrepreneurial activity from 2008 to 2009. Americans between\nages fifty-five and sixty-four constituted the second-largest jump. The reasons range from middle-\naged adults wanting to supplement their income to retired individuals wanting to continue working.\nRegardless of the reasons, older Americans are catching the entrepreneurial bug, which is good news\nfor everyone. Unfortunately, we don’t hear enough about these exciting data.\nInterestingly, research shows that older people are more likely to be successful when they start\nbusinesses. Older entrepreneurs have the experience needed to better navigate the rough waters of\nentrepreneurship. During years of work, they have developed a treasure chest of skills that makes\nthem highly valuable. For instance, if they go into business in the same industry in which they worked\nfor many years, their understanding of the business is a tremendous competitive advantage.\nIn other good news, University of Chicago economist David Galenson contends that\n“experimental innovators” require time to reach their peak. His research, which is largely credited\nwith cracking the code of the creative mind, concludes that experimental innovators do their best\nwork in life at an older age. They accomplish their genius through trial and error. Examples of these\ninnovators are Steve Jobs, Mark Twain, and Alfred Hitchcock.\nOlder people may give a bunch of reasons for saying they are too old to start a business, but they\nare just excuses, many of which are defended with misinformation. Now we have plenty of data and\nreasons to support why being in your later years is an asset, not a liability, when starting a business. If\nyou are in your early thirties, forties, or older, it is not too late to start a business. Don’t let your age\ndeter you from pursuing your dream. Ultimately, a solid business idea paired with flawless execution,\nnot a fresh face, is what leads to success in business.\n96) You Feel Unequaled Joy When Your Idea Becomes Reality\n“It’s alive!”\n—Dr. Frankenstein, in \nFrankenstein\nAfter launching my website as a college sophomore, I used to go to the campus computer labs of\ndifferent schools and set the default website of the browsers to my site. Doing this was not only an\neffective way to introduce the website to students, but it also allowed me to witness how students\nreacted to seeing and to using the site for the first time.\nMost of the first-time visitors were surprised to discover a professional-looking website that\ncreatively showcased their schools with news, photos, and video. In fact, some students who came to\nthe lab with their friends would immediately share the website with the people who came with them.\nThey were that excited. Meanwhile, I observed the students navigating my website—noticing what\nthey clicked on, how long they stayed on the site, and what expressions they had on their faces. Many\nstudents stayed on the site for a long period of time, clicking through the photo galleries, chatting with\nfriends, browsing personals, and enjoying the site’s features.\nAs the site grew in popularity, I saw more students using it. Being able to watch people use and\nenjoy something I created was especially gratifying and gave me a sense of joy that I had never\nexperienced. Often when you come up with an idea, it doesn’t always work in the real world the way\nyou envisioned it would. I didn’t have that problem. I got it right the first time.\nLikewise, when I launched my magazine a few years later, I watched readers flip through the\npages. Again, I had a hit with the magazine as readers all around Atlanta loved it and anticipated the\narrival of the next issue. I felt the same joy that I received from watching users browse the website.\nPerhaps the most joy came from receiving positive feedback from viewers of my website,\nreaders of my magazine, and eventually users of my software products. The feedback that I remember\nmost came from a mother whose daughter was in France as an exchange student during the terrorist\nattacks of September 11, 2001. She wrote me a poignant letter describing how her daughter viewed\nmy website often to stay connected with her school and country. It was a difficult time for her young\ndaughter while she was in Europe, and visiting my website enabled her to escape the anti-American\nsentiment she received at the time. The mother was truly grateful and moved enough to write me a\nthank-you letter. I was elated to know that my website served as an emotional haven for her daughter,\nsomething I never would have imagined.\nWhat do these anecdotes have to do with being an entrepreneur? They exhibit the fact that\nentrepreneurs take immense pride and joy in transforming their idea into reality. Knowing that your\nidea actually works and has impacted the world in some way is a feeling like no other. For many, it’s\neven a greater feeling than making the first sale or receiving the first payment.\nI am reminded of the overwhelming sense of joy that the character Dr. Emmett Brown—\naffectionately known as Doc—displays in one of my favorite movies, \nBack to the Future.\n When Doc\nrealizes that his time machine works, he is speechless for a few seconds, in a state of euphoric\namazement. Then he dances down the street as if no one is watching. It’s moments like this and the\nones I shared that motivate entrepreneurs to create; moments like these make our enterprising pursuits\nthat much more special.\n97) Following Your Passion Is Bogus\nIf passion drives you, let reason hold the reins.\n—Benjamin Franklin, entrepreneur; Founding Father, United States of America\nOne particular three-word phrase has become the mantra of entrepreneurs everywhere, used to\ninspire and to motivate the oppressed masses to liberate themselves from their chains of dispassion.\n“Follow your passion.” Another version is the following: “Do what you love.” Any variation of\nthis phrase has the same questionable assumption. It assumes that success comes from emotional\nsatisfaction or from engaging in an activity for which you have a strong liking or desire, the very\ndefinition of passion. Considering that success in entrepreneurship is having a profitable business,\nthis assumption is far from the truth. Contrarily, success comes from doing that which often gives you\nthe least emotional satisfaction.\nDespite this reality, many seasoned entrepreneurs perpetuate the passion myth when discussing\nhow to be successful in business. Studies show that it is much easier to inspire and to motivate\nthrough positive reinforcement, but this approach undermines the importance of doing what’s difficult\nand uncomfortable on a consistent basis to propel a business forward. Instead of emphasizing that\npeople do what they love, we should at least draw equal attention to the need to tackle with the same\nenergy the things they hate.\nWhat do I mean by “hate”? When you have a business, especially a young business, you\ninevitably find yourself doing things that are not enjoyable. Whether it’s making cold calls to generate\nmore business or firing an unproductive employee, these unpleasant tasks are key to staying on the\nright path. The strongest and wisest entrepreneurs learn to assume these tasks diligently and without\nfail.\nRecently, business mogul Mark Cuban caused quite a stir when he published a blog post that\nadded a different take on the passion myth. Known for speaking his mind, Cuban wrote,\n“Follow Your Passion” is easily the worst advice you could ever give or get. . . . There are\nalways going to be things we love to do. That we dream about doing. That we really really\nwant to do with our lives. Those passions aren’t worth a nickel. . . . If you really want to\nknow where your destiny lies, look at where you apply your time. . . . Don’t follow your\npassions, follow your effort.\nCuban’s perspective, which is different but equally valid, was the result of an honest assessment of\nthe fallacy that money, happiness, and success magically appear when you follow your passion.\nEntrepreneurs shouldn’t necessarily be encouraging people to follow their passion to attain\nsuccess in business. This advice is more applicable to a lofty self-help goal in life. Business is about\nsolving problems, improving the quality of life, creating new solutions, and yes, making money. These\nthings involve a great deal of pain and drudgery, not endless euphoria. If you are able to align\nbuilding a solid business with doing what you love, that’s great, but it certainly isn’t a requirement.\nLikewise, it’s a bad idea to try to monetize your passion without extensive consideration. Finally,\nwhether your business has anything to do with your passion shouldn’t be the determining factor in why\nyou want to start a business.\n98) You Have the Right Motivation\nMoney was never the motivation.\n—Katarina Witt, German figure skater, model\nAs an entrepreneur develops, so should that person’s motivation. In most cases, we talk about\nmotivation in general terms; rarely, if ever, do we place a value judgment on the different types. We\nassume that all motivation, as long as it catalyzes entrepreneurial activity, is acceptable. Or we\nassume that most entrepreneurs are ultimately motivated by money. (The goal of business, after all, is\nto make a profit.) However, these common assumptions do not help us delineate and value the\ndifferent types of motivation, which can be used to examine an entrepreneur’s success or failure—and\nprogress or retrogress—at a given moment. For example, entrepreneurial motivation varies in\nintensity, validity, and sustainability. To better explain these degrees of difference, I have formed a\ncontext or framework that attempts to explain the natural maturation of a typical entrepreneur’s\nmotivation in three basic stages along with some of their challenges.\n1. \nThe first level of motivation has to do with one’s desire to leave or to avoid a job because\nof unsatisfactory conditions,\n whether it’s a demanding workload, little freedom, difficult colleagues,\nlack of opportunity, or low pay. While employed, this future entrepreneur wishes to leave a job but\nhas an unwillingness or hesitation to forfeit some of the comforts of employment. These comforts may\ninclude a lack of responsibility, a steady paycheck and benefits, or a sense of security.\nThis level is the least mature and organic motivation for entrepreneurship. The motivation comes\nfrom an urge to get away or to escape, not to solve a business problem. Besides, other jobs can\nalways offer a better experience and thus alleviate unsatisfactory conditions. In the case that a person\nfinds such an accommodating job, the urge to pursue entrepreneurship subsides. Furthermore, this\nperson is likely pursue entrepreneurship to re-create a similar environment to the one just abandoned,\nbut on one’s own terms. This entrepreneur is working to restore a level of comfort. Therefore,\nentrepreneurs who are at this level rarely go beyond self-employment or sole proprietorship and opt\nfor lifestyle entrepreneurship. Regardless, when the courage comes to leave the job and to start a\nbusiness, the motivation goes to the second level.\n2. \nThe second level of motivation deals with survival\n, and is perhaps the most natural level of\nthe three. This motivation is ingrained in us as humans. Still, an entrepreneur who escaped the\nconfines of a 9-to-5 will struggle to grow accustomed to this new motivation, especially in going\nfrom an employee mentality to an entrepreneur mentality. While entrepreneurs eat only what they kill,\nemployees eat regardless of what they kill. While entrepreneurs don’t expect a steady paycheck,\nemployees know exactly how much they will earn and when that amount will be paid. While\nentrepreneurs believe that the potential of their company is greater than the compensation from any\njob, employees define their potential within the confines of their company. Most importantly,\nentrepreneurs are motivated by an intrinsic sense of survival, and employees are motivated by an\nextrinsic sense of entitlement.\nThis level presents a unique but understandable problem for entrepreneurs. I call it the\n“subsistence entrepreneurship” problem. Entrepreneurs motivated primarily by survival or by\nmaintaining a certain standard of living often don’t exceed the efforts needed to meet these goals. As a\nresult, their businesses hardly grow. Entrepreneurs may start new, promising ventures, but inevitably\ntheir growth is limited by their own efforts or lack of ambition to overachieve. Entrepreneurs at this\nlevel must devise a clever growth strategy and goals that pull them outside of their new equilibrium.\nMost entrepreneurs never go beyond this level of motivation.\n3. \nThe third level of motivation has to do with creating a great product or service that meets\na need or solves a problem.\n As opposed to the previous two levels, only this level finds motivation\nwithin the context of the business world. Therefore, this level of motivation is most appropriate and\nconducive to high achievement.\nFor example, PayPal was not necessarily created to make global payments and money transfers\nvia the Internet easier. Instead, it stemmed from cofounder Peter Thiel’s libertarian beliefs fortified\nwhile a college student. PayPal was a solution to the problem of countries, dictators in particular,\nmanipulating currencies and thereby destroying free-market systems. Similarly, Facebook’s cofounder\nMark Zuckerberg has been driven by a desire to create a great product that makes the world more\ntransparent and connected.\nThe most revered entrepreneurs of our lifetime have overwhelmingly come from a position of\nfinancial privilege, which largely allows them to bypass the first two levels of motivation. For the\nmost part, they do not have to contend with the psychological baggage and limitations of the previous\nlevels. For example, focusing on building a revolutionary product is much easier when you don’t need\nto work a full-time job to eat or pay the bills. Statistics show that most entrepreneurs do not have this\nadvantage.\nThere certainly are other motivations for becoming an entrepreneur than the three presented here,\nbut they are inferior. The goal of entrepreneurs should be to align their motivation with their\nbusiness’s objective, which is an element of the third and highest level of motivation. Once you\nachieve this level, your company has the highest potential for greatness.\n99) You Love Your Life\nThe best way to predict the future is to create it.\n—Peter Drucker, author, management consultant\nSometimes I have to pinch myself and ask, “Is this for real?” For instance, I recently played eighteen\nholes of golf on a beautiful private course in Orlando, Florida, with three physicians, some of whom\ncertainly have a net worth in the millions. On the sixteenth hole, one of my major clients called to\nverify my company’s address to send two large checks. At the same time, my various businesses are\ngenerating income (I get e-mail alerts about sales figures). Meanwhile, my family is enjoying an\nextended vacation at Disney World and other attractions around Orlando. Normally, we fly to\ndestinations, but this time we drove because one of my clients gave me a luxury SUV to use for the\ntrip. And that was just one day!\nOther pinch-myself moments include being invited by the Norwegian government to stay in the\nNobel Prize winner’s suite at the Grand Hotel in Oslo, being invited to the White House by President\nBarack Obama, eating dinner with Kenya’s vice president in Nairobi, sitting courtside at an NBA\nAll-Star Game, playing golf with Vice President Joe Biden in St. Thomas, chatting with Kanye West\nduring a private listening party for his new album, and so on. All of these great moments occurred\nbecause I had the fortitude to start my own business and to create value for these important\nindividuals and organizations.\nThe quality of life that I have had as an entrepreneur has been greater than anything I could have\nimagined. I am especially proud of the fact that my businesses have allowed me to support my\ngrowing family as well as the families of those who work for me, to travel the world to over twenty-\nfive countries, to help many charities and causes dear to my heart, and to inspire others to pursue their\ndreams. If I hadn’t caught the entrepreneurial bug during my sophomore year in college about twelve\nyears ago, I would lead a very different, almost certainly less-fulfilling life.\nYes, life is good—and you would probably expect me to tell you that as an evangelist of\nentrepreneurship—but things haven’t always been perfect, and I don’t expect them to always be that\nway.\nLife as an entrepreneur has been difficult, too. In some wearisome times I thought I was going to\nlose it all, wondering if the path that I was following was the right one. I’ve wanted to give up. In\nfact, on my worst days, all of these thoughts can cross my mind. However, no matter how down or\nunsure I have felt, I have always believed that entrepreneurship is the surest way to happiness and to\nself-actualization. This strong belief is perhaps what pulls me back again and again to start yet\nanother business.\nApparently, I am not the only one who feels this way. I have never met an entrepreneur who\nhates being an entrepreneur. Regardless of whether they are filing for bankruptcy or preparing for an\ninitial public offering, entrepreneurs love taking risks and starting businesses. For most of them (and\nme), no other way of life comes close.\nEntrepreneurs love their lives not necessarily because of the benefits of success but because we\nlove the game of entrepreneurship, which can bring joy \nand\n pain. An indescribable feeling of joy\ncomes from knowing that you are in control of your destiny, and this joy is present through the good\nand the bad times. When I say I love my life, it’s neither to gloat nor to boast, but to reaffirm my\nbelief that being an entrepreneur is life at its best. This is what makes entrepreneurs one of a kind.\n100) You’re an Entrepreneur Forever\n“You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill—you\nstay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.”\n—Morpheus, in \nThe Matrix\nAs I grow older, I sometimes imagine how my entrepreneurial drive will change when I reach the age\nof eighty, ninety, or even one hundred. Will I choose to go into retirement, a life full of rest, travel,\nand quality time with my grandchildren? Or will I continue to work in search of the next great idea\nthat will generate wealth, working long hours and going into the office? While a leisurely life in\nretirement is appealing and is the lifestyle most people aspire to when they reach their golden years, I\ndoubt that I will select that option. As I become a centenarian in 2079, I am sure that my\nentrepreneurial spirit will be just as strong and as ambitious as it is now.\nI have learned about the natural, riveting quality of entrepreneurship: Once you catch the bug, it\nnever leaves you. The ambition and will to reach entrepreneurship’s highest levels are no match for\ncommon obstacles like age or even failure.\nEven advanced age doesn’t matter. I am inspired by entrepreneurs like Truett Cathy, the ninety-\none-year-old founder of the quick-service restaurant Chick-fil-A. Cathy doesn’t let old age slow him\ndown. He adheres to his daily routine of getting up early and continues to play an important role in the\nbillion-dollar company he founded sixty-six years ago. In fact, Cathy released a book recently titled\nWealth: Is It Worth It?\n in which he discusses the opportunities and responsibility that wealth creates.\nWe can all learn from Cathy’s amazing drive at a time when most people his age slowed down long\nago.\nLikewise, it doesn’t matter how disastrous an entrepreneur’s last business was. I have yet to\nmeet someone who has totally written off entrepreneurship after failing at it miserably. No matter how\nterrible their experiences in business, entrepreneurs have the unique ability to separate the results of\ntheir endeavors from the sanctity of the concept of entrepreneurship itself. It could also be that the\ndream of acquiring financial independence and the ability to determine one’s own destiny has a strong\nhuman appeal.\nMuhammad Yunus, microfinance pioneer and Nobel Peace Prize winner, argues that\nentrepreneurship is as natural to our humanity as is our need to eat.\nAll human beings are entrepreneurs. When we were in the caves, we were all self-\nemployed . . . finding our food, feeding ourselves. That’s where human history began. . . .\nAs civilization came, we suppressed it. We became labor because they stamped us, “You\nare labor.” We forgot that we are entrepreneurs.\nPerhaps Yunus is on to something. He seems to have figured out the most primal reason to explain\nwhy once you are an entrepreneur you are always an entrepreneur. Or as Yunus might say, “Once you\nrealize your natural state of being as an entrepreneur, you’ll never return to viewing yourself as\nlabor.”\nRegardless of the reason entrepreneurship is so captivating, we can all agree that it is. Even if\nyou return to a 9-to-5 job, you will never view it in the same way. You are just an entrepreneur in\nhiding or in transition. Those of us who have taken the “red pill” know this already. But if you are\nconsidering entrepreneurship for the first time, know that once you are in Wonderland, it is forever.\nThere’s no turning back.\nAfterword\nThere is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.\n—Ernest Hemingway, author\nThank you for reading my book. I am grateful for your investment of both time and money.\nI hope that you have learned many valuable lessons that will inspire you to either start a business\nwith enhanced knowledge or to improve the current business that you have. I encourage you to share\nthis book with others who may also benefit from it.\nFurthermore, I hope that this is the beginning of a long-lasting relationship in which I can\ncontinue to give you advice, and you can give me feedback. Please follow me on my blog, Twitter,\nand Facebook. Via these social media outlets, you will find new content, including articles, speaking\nengagements, and future projects.\nFinally, I wish you much success as you continue on the most fulfilling and rewarding journey I\nknow: entrepreneurship.\nKevin D. Johnson\nAtlanta, Georgia, USA\nTwitter: @BizWizKevin\nE-mail: kevin@johnsonmedia.com\nWeb Site/Blog: \nTheEntrepreneurMind.com\nFacebook: \nhttp://www.facebook.com/TheEntrepreneurMind\nAcknowledgments\nThere is no such thing as a 'self-made' man. We are made up of thousands of others.\n—George Matthew Adams, American newspaper columnist\nWhen I want to accomplish a goal, I go all in. In other words, I find some way to challenge\nmyself by keeping a grueling schedule for one hundred days to attain my goal; I focus intently. When I\nran for political office in 2009 I committed to walking neighborhoods in my district and knocking on\ndoors to get votes for one hundred days in a row. When I wanted to run my first half marathon, I stuck\nto a rigid schedule that required me to train for about one hundred days. When I wanted to write this\nbook, I decided to write every day for at least one hundred days in a row. I accomplished that goal,\nand this book is a result of my steadfast efforts.\nHowever, it wasn’t as simple as sticking to my one-hundred-day plan and relying on my own\nability to make this book a reality. What may seem like an accomplishment achieved on my own is\nquite the opposite. Through the entire process of putting together this book, I have had much help and\nencouragement, whether it was from a close family member, a distant friend through social media, or\na professional editor. Without their help, this book would have never been published. It would have\nremained an unattainable dream, something unchecked on my bucket list. I can only hope that my\ngratitude and acknowledgment in this part of the book are sufficient to express how thankful I am for\neveryone’s help.\nFirst, I must acknowledge God who is my strength and whose glory is the purpose of my desire\nto succeed in life and in business.\nNext, I must thank my parents, Richard and Jean, for being the best parents anyone could have. I\nam because they are. Thank you for believing in me and supporting my entrepreneurial endeavors.\nAlso, thank you for instilling in my siblings and me a love for books and reading. My mom read to us\nconstantly as children. As we grew older, story time turned into a strong encouragement to read often.\nI can still hear her admonishing us, “Turn off the TV and read a book!” One of my most vivid\nmemories as a youngster is watching my father read and overhighlight one of his brightly covered\nstudy books on the Bible or receiving from him a marked-up book that he recently read on business\nmanagement. Barely out of middle school, I was reading books about corporate management and\nleadership.\nFurthermore, I owe so much to my wife, Deidre, who gave me the space needed to complete this\nproject from the start. Even with our demanding six-month-old son, she never wavered in her support.\nEven when our family vacation at Disney World coincided with my final seven days of writing, she\nencouraged me to finish strong and not to miss even a day. In general, her faithful support for my\nbusiness and goals in life has been a tremendous blessing. Nothing else can explain her excitement,\nencouragement, support, and tolerance but unconditional love.\nAlso, my siblings have been especially encouraging. My older brother, Richard, has been a huge\ninspiration to me, whether being one of the best jazz pianists in the world or recommending books I\nshould read. In fact, his first recommendation changed my life and my view of just how exciting books\ncan be. In high school, he gave me \nMiles Davis: The Autobiography,\n a riveting narrative that\nspawned my love for the autobiography genre and jazz trumpet. My younger sister, Angela, allowed\nme to borrow her business books from college to improve my finance, accounting, and marketing\nskills since I wasn’t a business major like she was.\nEqually supportive have been my extended family and my wife’s immediate and extended\nfamily. Whether it’s through leveraging their networks to help me or simply being my biggest fans,\nthey have all contributed to the success of this book. Special thanks goes to the Turners: Dennis,\nJanet, Dennise, Donnice, Dawn, and Dorian. Also, I thank the grandparents who have been\noverwhelmingly supportive.\nUndoubtedly, one of the biggest influences in my life was my church family in the Boston,\nMassachusetts, area, where I lived for many years until my senior year in high school. It was a\nspecial church group in which several accomplished men and women owned their own businesses\nand encouraged us youngsters to follow in their footsteps. Many of them were technology\nentrepreneurs and are still in business to this day. In fact, I sometimes do business with them. There\nwere also lawyers and doctors who owned their own practices. They taught me that starting a\nbusiness and thriving in what may seem like unfavorable conditions was not only possible, but also\nexpected. Thank you especially to Carlo Cadet, Michael Collison, Michael Dawson, Mr. and Mrs.\nLarry Edmonds, Tom Farrington, James Grigsby, Jonathan Mayo, Denzil McKenzie, Kevin Pearson,\nDarrin Poullard, Malcolm Roberts, Michael Robinson, Lyndon Myers, and John Womack. All of you\nwere excellent examples.\nI am especially thankful to those of you who have taken the time to read or to preview copies of\nmy book and to give me feedback. Likewise, those of you who follow me on Twitter and read my\nblog were invaluable during this whole process. Still, thanks to all of you who have provided\nquotations in support of this project. These gracious people include Dexter Caffey, Andrew Dietz,\nScott Gerber, Vivian Giang, Christopher Hanks, James Herbert, Samuel T. Jackson, Paul Judge,\nShaun King, Robert Lahm, Kent Matlock, David Meredith, Chau Nguyen, Eric Overby, Michael\nRussell, Devon Wijesinghe, and others. Your insights, comments, and endorsements have made this a\nmuch better book and have given me increased confidence.\nThere is nothing more humbling and painful than having your manuscript critiqued and edited.\nIt’s one of the most humbling experiences I have ever gone through. Nevertheless, it’s necessary to\nmake my message clear and effective—and that’s a good thing. As a result of going through the editing\nprocess, I have become a better writer and communicator. Bob Land, who is a master editor, was\ninvaluable. Thank you so much for your suggestions and expertise.\nAnd finally, I thank all of my colleagues, mentors, and friends who have supported me over the\nyears. I have attempted to list as many of you as possible. If I omit anyone important, I apologize. It\ncertainly wasn’t intentional.
