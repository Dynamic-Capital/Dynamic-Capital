Name: Barometric pressure profile

Equation(s):
```math
p(h) = p_0 \exp\left(- \frac{M g h}{R T}\right)
```

Assumptions:
- Temperature $T$ is constant with altitude in the layer of interest.
- Air behaves as an ideal gas with constant molar mass $M$ and gravity $g$.

Calibration:
- Use surface pressure $p_0$ and temperature readings to parameterize the profile.
- Validate against radiosonde measurements to adjust $T$ or incorporate lapse-rate corrections.
