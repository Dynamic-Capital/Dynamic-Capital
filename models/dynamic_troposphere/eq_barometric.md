Name: Barometric pressure profile

Equation(s):

```math
p(h) = p_0 \exp\left(- \frac{M g h}{R T}\right)
```

Assumptions:

- Temperature $T$ is constant with altitude in the layer of interest.
- Air behaves as an ideal gas with constant molar mass $M$ and gravity $g$.

Calibration:

- Use surface pressure $p_0$ and temperature readings to parameterize the
  profile.
- Validate against radiosonde measurements to adjust $T$ or incorporate
  lapse-rate corrections.
