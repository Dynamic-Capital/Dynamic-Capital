Name: Cosine similarity scoring Purpose: Converts TF-IDF weighted vectors into
comparable relevance scores across documents.

Equation(s):

```math
s_t(q, d) = \frac{\sum_i w_{t,i}(q) \, w_{t,i}(d)}{\sqrt{\sum_i w_{t,i}(q)^2} \; \sqrt{\sum_i w_{t,i}(d)^2}}
```

Assumptions:

- Query weights $w_{t,i}(q)$ mirror document weighting (including smoothing) to
  preserve geometric interpretation.
- Numerical stability is guarded by clipping denominators below a tolerance
  $\epsilon$.
- Filters $m_t$ shrink the candidate set so the denominator leverages only
  documents eligible for the query.

Calibration:

- **Data**: Relevance judgments or implicit feedback (CTR, dwell time) to
  evaluate score-to-behavior alignment.
- **Method**: Offline evaluation with NDCG / MAP metrics guiding optional
  rescaling or bias terms.
- **Parameter mapping**: Scaling factors integrate into $\beta$ and $w_k$ when
  balancing exploration penalties in the objective.

Usage notes:

- The scoring output ranks top-$K$ documents and feeds snippet generation
  modules.
- Monitor distribution drift; if vector norms collapse or explode, revisit token
  normalization and decay factors.
