# dynamic_blockchain model

State: x_t = [D_t, H_t, q_t]  (difficulty, aggregate hash rate, mempool size)
Controls: u_t = [ΔD_t]  (protocol difficulty adjustment)
Params: θ = [τ_*, α_H, α_q]  (target block interval, hash-rate response, transaction arrival rate)

Dynamics:
D_{t+1} = D_t + ΔD_t
H_{t+1} = H_t + α_H (ξ^H_t)
q_{t+1} = q_t + α_q - \frac{H_t}{D_t} + ξ^q_t

Outputs:
y_t = [T_t, \text{throughput}_t] = [D_t / H_t, \min(q_t, H_t / D_t)]

Objective:
min J = Σ_t [(T_t - τ_*)^2 + w_q q_t]

Constraints:
D_t > 0,  H_t > 0,  q_t ≥ 0
