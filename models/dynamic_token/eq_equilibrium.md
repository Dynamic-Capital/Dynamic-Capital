Name: Linear demand-supply equilibrium

Equation(s):

```math
Q_D = \alpha - \beta P, \quad Q_S = \gamma + \delta P, \quad P^* = \frac{\alpha - \gamma}{\beta + \delta}
```

Assumptions:

- Demand and supply curves are linear around the operating regime.
- Market clears instantly with no inventory backlogs.

Calibration:

- Regress observed quantities on prices to estimate
  $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$.
- Recompute $P^*$ whenever structural shifts in demand or supply elasticities
  are detected.
