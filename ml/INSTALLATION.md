# ML Environment Installation Verification

To validate the current `ml/requirements.txt` dependency set, run the following command from the project root:

```
pip install --no-cache-dir -r ml/requirements.txt
```

## Latest Verification

- **Date:** 2025-10-06
- **Python:** Python 3.12.10
- **Result:** Installation completed successfully in the default container environment with all packages resolving, including GPU-enabled PyTorch 2.8.0 and LangChain 0.3.27.

If you encounter issues, confirm adequate disk space (the CUDA-enabled PyTorch wheel exceeds 800â€¯MB) and rerun with `--no-cache-dir` to avoid cache size growth.
