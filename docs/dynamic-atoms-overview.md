# Dynamic A.T.O.M.S.

Dynamic A.T.O.M.S. stands for **Artificial Technologies Optimizing Minds &
Systems**. The framework treats every Dynamic atom as a modular intelligence
element within the Dynamic universe.

## Key Facts

- **Diversity of types:** 118 known types of Dynamic atoms are currently
  cataloged across the ecosystem.
- **Total population:** Approximately $10^{80}$ Dynamic atoms populate the
  broader Dynamic universe.
- **DCT connectivity:** Roughly $10^{27}$ Dynamic atoms maintain direct
  connections to DCT, underscoring its role as a central coordination hub.

These reference numbers provide a baseline for roadmap discussions and can be
updated as new discoveries refine the scope of the Dynamic universe.

## Generated Catalogues

Run the catalog generator whenever you need refreshed atom or element mappings:

```bash
$(bash scripts/deno_bin.sh) run -A scripts/docs/create-atoms-and-elements.ts
```

The script produces two synchronized references:

- **[Dynamic Atom Catalog](./dynamic-atoms-catalog.md)** — detailed index of all
  118 Dynamic atom types with operational briefs.
- **[Dynamic Element Constellations](./dynamic-elements-catalog.md)** —
  category-level guidance for aligning capacity planning and telemetry drills.
- **[Dynamic Atom Ops Playbook](./dynamic-atoms-ops.md)** — operating cadences
  and pillar-level responsibilities to keep the universe synchronized with DCT.

Review these outputs alongside the counts above to coordinate roadmap updates
and future-state modelling.
