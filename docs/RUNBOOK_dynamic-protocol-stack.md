# Dynamic Protocol Stack Implementation Runbook

## Purpose
This runbook operationalizes the protocol layering framework by sequencing the
delivery of networking, blockchain, intelligence, and governance capabilities.
Follow it when spinning up a new environment or executing quarterly hardening
cycles so each layer lands with the required telemetry, automation, and
handoffs.

## Tooling Checklist
- [ ] Provision IaC repositories (Terraform/Pulumi) for every target environment.
- [ ] Ensure observability platform (Grafana/Loki/Tempo or equivalent) is online.
- [ ] Grant secrets manager access (1Password, Vault, or Doppler) to each stream.
- [ ] Enable GitHub environments with required branch protections for rollout.
- [ ] Align documentation storage (Notion/Docs) with versioned mirrors in repo.

## Phase 0: Pre-flight Alignment (1 week)
**Objectives:** Confirm prerequisites, dependencies, and success metrics.

1. **Architecture sync**
   - Review [dynamic_protocol_layers.md](./dynamic_protocol_layers.md) to affirm
     scope per layer.
   - Capture non-functional requirements (latency, throughput, compliance).
2. **Roadmap traceability**
   - Link each deliverable to roadmap items in `docs/ROADMAP.md` and the
     adoption checklist in `dynamic_protocol_layers.md`.
3. **Environment readiness**
   - Validate staging infrastructure capacity, secrets rotation cadence, and
     rollback procedures.
4. **Kick-off stand-up**
   - Schedule cross-stream daily stand-up and weekly deep dives; assign runbook
     coordinator to capture minutes.

**Exit Criteria:** Dependencies mapped, backlog created in project tool, and
stakeholders signed off on schedule.

## Phase 1: Network Fabric Activation (2 weeks)
**Dependencies:** Phase 0 complete.

1. **Redundant connectivity**
   - Configure dual ISP/BGP paths, failover playbooks, and run packet-loss tests.
2. **Perimeter hardening**
   - Ship WAF rules, API gateway policies, and zero-trust posture updates.
3. **Observability baseline**
   - Instrument latency dashboards, SSH audit trails, and DNS health monitors.
4. **Change review**
   - Conduct security review for firewall changes; document results in
     `docs/NETWORKING.md`.

**Exit Criteria:** Automated failover drill passes, latency SLAs met, and
security review signed.

## Phase 2: Decentralized Settlement Enablement (3 weeks)
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 exit criteria met.

1. **Contract deployment pipeline**
   - Implement CI that runs formal verification and automated tests before
     shipping contracts.
2. **Treasury bridges & custody**
   - Stand up TON/EVM bridges with monitoring hooks and insurance coverage
     thresholds.
3. **Decentralized storage integration**
   - Configure IPFS/Filecoin pinning, backup retention, and content addressing
     indexes for governance artifacts.
4. **Risk and compliance review**
   - Update `docs/compliance/*` evidence with new attestations and risk matrices.

**Exit Criteria:** Smart contracts live on staging, bridge monitoring alerts in
place, and compliance sign-off received.

## Phase 3: Intelligence Mesh Rollout (3 weeks)
**Dependencies:** Phases 1–2 complete.

1. **Service mesh deployment**
   - Install Istio/Linkerd with mTLS, sidecar proxies, and policy enforcement.
2. **Agent registry & schema governance**
   - Launch registry APIs, enforce JSON/Protobuf schema versions, and document
     compatibility rules.
3. **Feature store + inference gateways**
   - Connect training pipelines, deploy inference autoscaling, and publish SLOs.
4. **Secrets & model governance**
   - Integrate secrets manager with AGI agents, track model lineage, and define
     rollback triggers.

**Exit Criteria:** Mesh health score above 95%, registry accessible, and models
serving from managed gateways with rollback automation.

## Phase 4: Event Feedback Spine (2 weeks)
**Dependencies:** Phase 3 stable.

1. **Messaging fabric setup**
   - Provision Kafka/NATS clusters with schema registry and idempotent consumer
     templates.
2. **Event taxonomy alignment**
   - Map mentorship, trading, and governance events to canonical topics;
     register payload contracts.
3. **Replay & retention controls**
   - Define retention policies, cold-storage exports, and replay drills for
     incident analysis.
4. **Observability integration**
   - Feed event metrics into dashboards, alert on lag/backlog, and archive runbook
     outputs in `docs/event-streaming/`.

**Exit Criteria:** Event lag under target thresholds, replay drill successful,
and runbook signed by Event Infrastructure Lead.

## Phase 5: Governance & Alignment Systems (2 weeks)
**Dependencies:** Phases 1–4 complete.

1. **DAO tooling rollout**
   - Configure Snapshot/Aragon stacks, token/reputation weighting, and quorum
     enforcement.
2. **Policy-as-code automation**
   - Enforce guardrails via Open Policy Agent/GitHub checks linked to
     governance events.
3. **Compliance evidence trail**
   - Sync audit logs, attestations, and identity proofs into compliance storage.
4. **Community charter integration**
   - Publish Maldivian cultural protocols and ethics charter updates alongside
     enforcement hooks.

**Exit Criteria:** Governance vote executed end-to-end in staging, policy-as-code
blocks failing changes, and compliance repository updated.

## Phase 6: Experience & Community Layer (3 weeks)
**Dependencies:** All prior phases complete.

1. **Unified dashboards**
   - Integrate trading, governance, and mentorship insights with access control
     alignment.
2. **Localization & accessibility**
   - Deliver multilingual support, mobile responsiveness, and accessibility audits.
3. **Identity-linked rewards**
   - Connect DID/VC proofs to AGI oracle scoring and in-app achievements.
4. **Beta release & feedback loop**
   - Run closed beta, capture feedback, and triage issues into backlog.

**Exit Criteria:** Dashboard adoption targets met, accessibility audits passed,
and beta feedback triaged.

## Phase 7: Launch & Sustainment (ongoing)
- [ ] Schedule quarterly resilience drills for each layer.
- [ ] Review telemetry and backlog alignment during monthly governance meeting.
- [ ] Update runbook after every major incident or protocol upgrade.
- [ ] Rotate ownership if team composition changes; capture knowledge transfer.

## Reporting & Metrics
- **Weekly status report:** Summarize completed tasks, risks, and next steps.
- **Milestone burndown:** Track planned vs. completed tasks per phase.
- **Operational KPIs:** Latency, protocol uptime, governance participation, and
  AGI model accuracy.
- **Post-implementation review:** Within two weeks of launch, run a retrospective
  and file learnings in `docs/postmortems/`.
