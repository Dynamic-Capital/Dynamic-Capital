# Dynamic Capital Component Naming Map

## Purpose

This reference consolidates the short names, full component names, and primary
responsibilities that appear across the Dynamic Capital ecosystem. Use it when
you need a quick lookup for protocol discussions, documentation, or cross-team
alignment.

- **Scope** â€” Covers protocol, intelligence, outreach, frontend, and
  regenerative subsystems that regularly appear in roadmap and architecture
  briefs.
- **Usage** â€” Link to this map from feature specs, onboarding decks, or
  governance proposals so contributors have a shared vocabulary.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Pair this glossary with the visual protocol diagrams in
> `dynamic_ecosystem/` to give stakeholders both textual and spatial context for
> each component.

## Next Steps

- Add diagrams or sequence maps that visualize interactions between adjacent
  components when presenting to stakeholders.
- Embed this table into README files or dashboards that need a lightweight
  glossary for DCT and TON initiatives.
- Extend the map with ownership metadata (e.g. maintainer squad, Slack channels,
  or Notion docs) to accelerate cross-team handoffs.

## README Snippet

Include the following excerpt in team-specific READMEs to highlight how the
modules connect back to the broader ecosystem:
