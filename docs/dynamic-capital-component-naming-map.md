# Dynamic Capital Component Naming Map

## Purpose

This reference consolidates the short names, full component names, and primary
responsibilities that appear across the Dynamic Capital ecosystem. Use it when
you need a quick lookup for protocol discussions, documentation, or cross-team
alignment.

- **Scope** — Covers protocol, intelligence, outreach, frontend, and
  regenerative subsystems that regularly appear in roadmap and architecture
  briefs.
- **Usage** — Link to this map from feature specs, onboarding decks, or
  governance proposals so contributors have a shared vocabulary.
