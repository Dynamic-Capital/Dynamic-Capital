# Dynamic Capital Narrative Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to operationalize the recommended messaging upgrades for
Dynamic Capital. The flow emphasizes pairing each implementation push with an
immediate review and optimization pass so the Maldives prosperity story stays
sharp across investor, tokenomics, mentorship, marketing, and roadmap
touchpoints.

## Quick-Start Flow

1. [ ] **Assign owners** for each domain (investor materials, tokenomics,
       mentorship, marketing, roadmap, messaging, governance).
2. [ ] **Schedule a back-to-back review ➜ optimize working block** (e.g., 60
       minutes review, 45 minutes optimization) within the same sprint.
3. [ ] **Collect the latest macro data package** (GDP, PPP, supporting
       citations) and distribute it to all owners before implementation work
       begins, noting the refresh cadence per source.
4. [ ] **Subscribe to source update alerts** (IMF, World Bank, national
       statistics portals) or add them to an automation feed so data refreshes
       trigger tasks automatically.
5. [ ] **Log the checklist in your project tracker** with due dates for the
       implementation run and the review/optimization follow-up.
6. [ ] **Record the source metadata** (publication, URL, access date) inside the
       shared Maldives Data Tracker template so every team can deep-link
       citations without version drift.
7. [ ] **Snapshot baselines** (deck version numbers, dashboard commit hashes)
       so post-optimization diffs are easy to audit.

## Macro Data Application Playbook

- [ ] **Lead with credibility.** Highlight Maldives GDP per capita (nominal
      and PPP) in decks, whitepapers, and website hero copy with clear source
      links so investors immediately understand the premium-income backdrop.
- [ ] **Tie tokenomics to momentum.** Reference GDP-per-capita CAGR when
      explaining supply schedules, staking yields, or treasury allocations to
      show how protocol mechanics parallel national growth.
- [ ] **Score mentorship by outcomes.** Weight mentor and mentee reputation
      metrics toward certifications, venture funding, or export wins that echo
      the prosperity narrative.
- [ ] **Bridge local to global.** Spotlight Maldivian partnerships in marketing
      materials while outlining how the operating model scales to other
      markets.
- [ ] **Anchor roadmap proof points.** Pair macro claims with specific delivery
      milestones (e.g., AI trading desk launch dates, marketplace onboarding
      targets) so the “living protocol” story maps to tangible execution.

## 1. Reinforce Investor Materials with Macro Credibility

### Implement

- [ ] Gather the latest Maldives GDP per capita (nominal and PPP) data from
      authoritative sources (IMF, World Bank) and record citation details.
- [ ] Update pitch deck executive summary, whitepaper introduction, and website
      hero copy with the refreshed GDP figures and source links.
- [ ] Pair each macro data point with a one-line explanation that connects high
      income status to Dynamic Capital’s ambition (e.g., "exporting
      Maldivian-built finance tooling").
- [ ] Create a reusable graphic or slide highlighting the GDP trajectory for
      inclusion across investor materials.

### Review (Run immediately before optimization)

- [ ] Confirm every macro statement traces to a linked citation with the exact
      publication year.
- [ ] Have investor-relations and finance stakeholders validate that the numbers
      match internal spreadsheets and regulatory disclosures.
- [ ] Spot-check the new narrative paragraph in the pitch deck, whitepaper, and
      website for tone consistency and readability.

### Optimize (Run right after the review session)

- [ ] Iterate slide layout or hero copy based on reviewer feedback (e.g., adjust
      typography, add call-out boxes).
- [ ] Run a quick A/B copy test or qualitative review with target investors to
      confirm clarity.
- [ ] Update the asset library (Notion, Figma, shared drives) with the final
      approved versions.

### Future-Proof

- [ ] Track upcoming macro release dates and pre-build placeholders in assets so
      refreshed numbers only require value swaps.

## 2. Tie Tokenomics to National Momentum

### Implement

- [ ] Review current token supply schedules, staking yields, and treasury
      deployment plans for alignment opportunities with Maldives GDP growth
      projections.
- [ ] Produce visuals (charts or overlays) that map token value accrual or yield
      targets against GDP-per-capita CAGR scenarios.
- [ ] Document how macro indicators influence protocol levers (e.g., adjusting
      staking rewards) in the tokenomics paper.
- [ ] Validate that public-facing dashboards reference the same data sources
      cited in investor materials.

### Review

- [ ] Verify that sensitivity tables and charts use identical GDP assumptions as
      the investor materials section.
- [ ] Conduct a peer review with the token engineering team to confirm the macro
      linkages are technically sound.
- [ ] Ensure risk disclaimers and assumptions are clearly documented alongside
      the visuals.

### Optimize

- [ ] Update staking calculators or dashboards to highlight the new
      macro-aligned levers.
- [ ] Add scenario callouts (base, bull, bear) tied to specific GDP outcomes to
      improve investor comprehension.
- [ ] Publish a brief tokenomics explainer post summarizing the macro alignment.

### Future-Proof

- [ ] Bake GDP scenario variables into token models so future updates become
      data inputs instead of rewrites.
- [ ] Maintain a changelog that maps macro updates to protocol parameter changes
      for investor transparency.

## 3. Anchor Mentorship Scoring to the Living Protocol Narrative

### Implement

- [ ] Audit existing mentorship reputation metrics to identify where national
      development outcomes can be incorporated (certifications, funded ventures,
      export wins).
- [ ] Define weighted scoring criteria that reward outcomes contributing to
      Maldivian human-capital growth.
- [ ] Update mentorship marketplace documentation and onboarding flows to
      explain the new scoring logic.
- [ ] Establish tracking and reporting cadence that showcases mentorship-driven
      progress alongside macro data.

### Review

- [ ] Run a dry-run scoring simulation on historical mentorship data to confirm
      the new weights behave as expected.
- [ ] Gather feedback from mentors and mentees on whether the narrative-driven
      criteria feel fair and motivating.
- [ ] Check that documentation, onboarding flows, and dashboards all use
      identical terminology.

### Optimize

- [ ] Adjust weightings or thresholds based on review findings and publish the
      rationale in release notes.
- [ ] Add quick-reference tooltips or glossary entries explaining how mentorship
      outcomes ladder up to the national narrative.
- [ ] Integrate success metrics into the mentorship analytics dashboard for
      ongoing visibility.

### Future-Proof

- [ ] Create a mentorship metric backlog capturing emerging national development
      signals to integrate as the Maldives economy evolves.

## 4. Local-to-Global Go-to-Market Positioning

### Implement

- [ ] Inventory current marketing copy, campaigns, and community activations for
      opportunities to highlight "Maldivian excellence".
- [ ] Secure or document partnerships with Maldivian financial institutions,
      tourism ventures, or government initiatives to feature in marketing
      collateral.
- [ ] Refresh campaign messaging to frame Dynamic Capital as the digital
      expression of the nation’s success story scaling abroad.
- [ ] Produce case studies or spotlight pieces that illustrate how local wins
      translate into global use cases.

### Review

- [ ] Present refreshed messaging to marketing, community, and partnership leads
      for alignment.
- [ ] Validate that every asset links back to approved macro data and cites the
      relevant partnerships.
- [ ] Cross-check that tone and imagery align with brand guidelines and
      accessibility standards.

### Optimize

- [ ] Iterate campaigns based on review feedback (e.g., tighten CTAs, update
      visuals for clarity).
- [ ] Tag refreshed assets in the CMS/CRM to enable performance tracking against
      narrative-driven KPIs.
- [ ] Publish an internal rollout note summarizing updates so support and sales
      teams can reinforce the story.

### Future-Proof

- [ ] Stand up evergreen campaign modules that accept updated macro stats and
      partnerships via CMS fields rather than hard-coded copy.

## 5. Roadmap Milestones Linked to the Narrative

### Implement

- [ ] Compile upcoming product releases (e.g., AI trading desk, mentor
      marketplace expansions) with target timelines.
- [ ] Ensure each milestone statement explicitly ties execution to the macro
      credibility narrative ("encoding the Maldives’ growth story").
- [ ] Publish the roadmap across investor and community channels with
      synchronized messaging.
- [ ] Set up quarterly reviews to confirm milestones remain aligned with updated
      macro data and protocol performance.

### Review

- [ ] Walk through the roadmap with product, engineering, and leadership
      stakeholders to validate dependencies and messaging.
- [ ] Confirm every milestone has measurable success metrics that echo the macro
      narrative.
- [ ] Inspect cross-channel announcements (blog, email, social, investor
      updates) for timeline consistency.

### Optimize

- [ ] Adjust milestone copy, visuals, or sequencing in response to stakeholder
      feedback.
- [ ] Update OKRs or KPI dashboards to reflect the refined narrative-linked
      targets.
- [ ] Capture lessons learned in the roadmap changelog for future cycles.

### Future-Proof

- [ ] Build roadmap milestones in a structured database (e.g., Linear, Airtable)
      with narrative tags so future strategy pivots remain traceable.

## 6. Messaging Enhancements from Follow-up Feedback

### Implement

- [ ] Add GDP source citations directly in the key narrative paragraph (pitch
      deck, website, whitepaper) so investors can verify claims quickly.
- [ ] Insert an immediate follow-up sentence after the narrative paragraph that
      references a concrete, time-bound product milestone (e.g., "AI trading
      desk beta launching in Q3").
- [ ] Verify tone and flow remain cohesive after edits, maintaining the
      progression of credibility anchor → narrative bridge → global positioning.
- [ ] Circulate the updated narrative to leadership and investor-relations
      stakeholders for approval before publishing.
- [ ] Embed the Maldives Data Tracker link near the paragraph in shared docs so
      reviewers can audit numbers and context in one click.

### Review

- [ ] Confirm the cited data points render correctly across all channels (PDF,
      web, slide deck) with accessible footnotes or tooltips.
- [ ] Collect qualitative feedback from at least three investor-facing teammates
      on the revised paragraph.
- [ ] Ensure translations or localized versions preserve the macro-to-product
      linkage.

### Optimize

- [ ] Refine phrasing, formatting, or placement based on reviewer input without
      diluting the core narrative.
- [ ] Update narrative templates or style guides to bake in the citation and
      milestone structure for future content.
- [ ] Archive previous messaging versions alongside a changelog entry detailing
      why updates were made.

### Future-Proof

- [ ] Template the narrative paragraph in your CMS or design system so new
      surfaces inherit citation and milestone requirements automatically.

## 7. Governance and Maintenance

### Implement

- [ ] Assign owners for refreshing macro data and messaging assets each quarter.
- [ ] Log checklist completion status in the team’s project management system
      for traceability.
- [ ] Archive superseded narrative versions with timestamps to maintain a change
      history.
- [ ] Schedule a semi-annual review to assess whether additional macro
      indicators should be incorporated.

### Review

- [ ] Conduct quarterly governance syncs to verify owners are meeting their
      refresh obligations.
- [ ] Audit asset repositories (Notion, Drive, Git) to ensure outdated messaging
      is clearly deprecated.
- [ ] Review checklist analytics or tracker data to confirm completion signals
      are accurate.

### Optimize

- [ ] Update ownership matrices or RACI charts when responsibilities shift.
- [ ] Automate data refresh reminders (e.g., calendar holds, Slack workflows)
      based on review findings.
- [ ] Introduce new macro indicators or narrative proof points as the Maldives
      economy evolves.

### Future-Proof

- [ ] Document contingency plans for major macro swings (tourism shocks, fiscal
      policy shifts) with pre-approved narrative responses.

## 8. Run the Review ➜ Optimize Loop Every Cycle

- [ ] Timebox the review and optimization sessions on the same day to maintain
      narrative momentum and prevent stale feedback.
- [ ] Capture review decisions, optimization changes, and outstanding risks in
      the project tracker before closing the cycle.
- [ ] Trigger the next implementation sprint only after the optimization tasks
      are signed off, ensuring the living protocol narrative stays coherent
      end-to-end.

## 9. Future-Proofing & Continuous Optimization Layer

### Implement

- [ ] Configure automated reminders in the project management tool that reopen
      the checklist ahead of macro data releases or major product launches.
- [ ] Establish a single source of truth dashboard that merges macro metrics,
      product KPIs, and messaging status with version history.
- [ ] Define decision thresholds that trigger rapid-response narrative reviews
      (e.g., if GDP revisions exceed ±1.5% or token metrics deviate from
      projections).
- [ ] Document escalation paths for compliance, legal, or regulatory updates
      that could impact messaging claims.

### Review

- [ ] Conduct quarterly retrospectives on the checklist process itself to
      identify automation or delegation opportunities.
- [ ] Validate that all automation hooks (webhooks, API pulls, calendar holds)
      are functioning and sending reminders to the correct channels.
- [ ] Audit the single source of truth dashboard for data freshness, access
      permissions, and redundancy safeguards.

### Optimize

- [ ] Expand the automation stack with emerging tooling (AI summarizers,
      real-time data monitors) once they meet security standards.
- [ ] Rotate checklist ownership across team leads annually to maintain
      organizational resilience.
- [ ] Publish a yearly state-of-the-narrative report summarizing macro shifts,
      protocol progress, and messaging updates to inform stakeholders.

## Appendix B: Narrative Paragraph Deployment Checklist

When inserting the signature paragraph that ties Maldives prosperity to Dynamic
Capital’s ecosystem, run this micro-checklist alongside the main flow:

1. [ ] **Source citation inline:** Add a superscript footnote or parenthetical
       credit (e.g., IMF 2024 Outlook) immediately after the GDP figures.
2. [ ] **Milestone follow-through:** Append one sentence that names the next
       shipped product or program milestone so readers connect narrative to
       execution.
3. [ ] **Channel localization:** Adapt the paragraph for each surface (deck
       slide, web hero, whitepaper) while keeping the credibility anchor →
       narrative bridge → global positioning structure intact.
4. [ ] **Tracker sync:** Confirm the numbers match the latest entries in the
       Maldives Data Tracker and that the tracker link is visible to reviewers.
