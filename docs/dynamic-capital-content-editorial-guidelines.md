# Dynamic Capital Content Editorial Guidelines

## Purpose

Dynamic Capital’s content demystifies the crypto industry for readers of all backgrounds. Every article, video, checklist, or social post should help people understand the latest developments, highlight the projects that matter, and show how to participate responsibly.

To deliver on that promise, contributors:

- Track trends across every crypto sector and vertical.
- Investigate the context behind new developments, drawing parallels with broader market history.
- Select topics and projects carefully so coverage builds trust and credibility.
- Perform comprehensive research, grounded in verifiable facts rather than hype or fear.
- Present insights in accessible language supported by charts, diagrams, or videos where helpful.
- Celebrate innovation while calling out clear risks, pitfalls, or gaps.

## Editorial Values

Dynamic Capital is not a daily news outlet, but we hold ourselves to rigorous editorial standards. Our users trust our market data and rely on our content with the same expectation of accuracy. Upholding that trust requires the following principles:

### Accuracy and Verification

- Base every claim on researched facts. Cross-check information with multiple reputable sources whenever possible.
- Call out unavoidable data gaps, assumptions, or limitations directly in the content.
- Document the provenance of data sets, screenshots, and analytics exports included in a piece.

### Context and Framing

- Provide enough background so readers understand why an event matters and how it relates to previous developments.
- Highlight macro trends, regulatory shifts, historical parallels, or competitive dynamics that shape the story.

### Clarity and Accessibility

- Use plain language and minimize jargon. When technical terms are required, define them or link to a glossary entry.
- Use analogies, diagrams, or charts to simplify complex topics.
- Structure long-form content with headings, summaries, and callouts so readers can scan effectively.

### Optimism with Realism

- Give projects a fair evaluation while applying a realistic lens to their claims.
- Surface known risks, technical hurdles, governance concerns, or market challenges alongside potential upsides.
- Be selective about which projects receive coverage; our curation is part of our credibility.

### Editorial Independence

- Writers and analysts retain agency over their work. Original analysis is encouraged and supported.
- Editors review and approve every piece prior to publication.
- Sponsored partners may suggest feedback, but the content team maintains final editorial control. We never publish misleading or incomplete information to satisfy a sponsor.

## “Not Financial Advice” Standard

Dynamic Capital does not—and is not licensed to—provide financial advice. All content is supplied strictly for general information.

- Do not publish price targets, forward-looking returns, or implied investment recommendations. Reference external price forecasts only when citing and linking to the original source.
- State clearly that users act on our content at their own risk and discretion.
- Make the “Not Financial Advice” disclaimer prominent in articles, videos, and downloadable assets.

## Conflicts of Interest

Dynamic Capital separates commercial relationships from editorial decisions.

- The Business Development team manages advertising and sponsored content independently from the Content team.
- Sponsored pieces follow the same guidelines outlined in this document and the content team retains final say on publication.
- Advertising relationships, including programmatic placements, do not influence editorial coverage or market data.
- Contributors disclose any personal investments or DAO participation related to potential coverage. Editors reassign pieces when a significant conflict exists.
- Content team members do not accept tokens, payments, or other inducements in exchange for coverage.

## Sponsored Content Policy

Sponsored content must meet the same standards as organic editorial work.

- Label sponsored pieces clearly at the beginning of the article, video description, or social post.
- Preserve the “Not Financial Advice” disclaimer and factual tone.
- Decline any sponsorship requests that require withholding material facts or publishing misleading claims.
- Reinforce that sponsored publication is not an endorsement of the sponsor’s products or services.
- Sponsored work has no impact on metrics, dashboards, or non-sponsored content across the Dynamic Capital platform.

## Collaborating Contributors and Freelancers

External collaborators and freelancers follow the same rules as internal contributors.

- Editors ensure collaborating writers receive and adhere to these guidelines.
- Freelancers sign contracts that cover conflicts of interest and disclosure obligations before beginning work.
- Editors address conflicts immediately, reassigning pieces when necessary.

## Attribution and Plagiarism

- Attribute all data, images, charts, and media obtained from third parties.
- Use quotation marks for direct excerpts and summarize responsibly when paraphrasing.
- Plagiarism is prohibited. Sources must be credited explicitly.

## Errors and Corrections

- Encourage readers to report errors through the Support channel or designated feedback form.
- Fix minor issues (typos, formatting) promptly.
- For substantive corrections, append a note summarizing the change and its rationale. When a correction note cannot be added (e.g., newsletters), include the correction in the next publication.

## Publication Checklist Alignment

Before publishing, confirm that:

1. Facts, metrics, and quotes are verified and cited.
2. Context and risk factors are clearly documented.
3. Disclaimers (“Not Financial Advice”) are prominent and accurate.
4. Conflicts of interest were disclosed and resolved.
5. Sponsored content—if applicable—is labeled and editorial independence preserved.

Adhering to these guidelines ensures every Dynamic Capital publication is trustworthy, balanced, and accessible.
