# AGI Intelligence Oracle Design for the Dynamic Capital Ecosystem

## Purpose

- Provide a tamper-resistant intelligence scoring layer that steers tokenomics
  (DCT burns, buybacks, dynamic pricing).
- Deliver transparent and auditable intelligence benchmarks for AGI-powered
  modules (mentorship, trading, user engagement, and self-improvement services).
- Facilitate interoperable data flows between AGI services, Telegram bots, TON
  smart contracts, and governance processes.

## Architectural Overview

### Design Principles

- **Modular and extensible**: scoring dimensions, data sources, and downstream
  integrations can be added or versioned without downtime.
- **Trust-minimized**: decentralized oracle nodes, threshold signatures, and
  cryptographic proofs prevent single-point manipulation.
- **On-/off-chain bridging**: deterministic pipelines convert off-chain
  analytics into on-chain actions.
- **Auditable**: all inputs, weights, and results are signed, timestamped, and
  published for community review.
- **Interoperable**: works seamlessly with Telegram bots, cross-chain bridges,
  TON connectors, and service microservices.

### Layered Architecture

| Layer                    | Responsibilities                                                                      | Notes                                                                                     |

## Intelligence Scoring Model

### Core Domains and Sample KPIs

| Domain                  | Metrics                                                                                 | Weight (governance configurable) | Primary Sources                                                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mentorship Performance  | Goal attainment %, mentee satisfaction, retention, adaptive response quality.           | 20%                              | Session analytics, post-session surveys, on-chain attestations.    |
| Trading Accuracy        | Sharpe/Sortino ratios, realized PnL, benchmark alpha, max drawdown, latency & slippage. | 35%                              | On-chain trade receipts, exchange APIs, signal logs.               |
| User Engagement         | DAU/MAU ratios, interaction depth, referral velocity, feedback sentiment.               | 25%                              | Telegram bot events, DApp analytics, signed user attestations.     |
| Module Upgrade Efficacy | Upgrade cadence, adoption %, backward compatibility, benchmark deltas.                  | 20%                              | Version control hooks, benchmark suites (ARC-AGI), telemetry KPIs. |

### Scoring Mechanics

1. **Metric Normalization**: Normalize each KPI to a 0–1 scale with
   governance-configurable min/max bands and documented fallback handling for
   missing data.
2. **Domain Aggregation**: Produce domain scores via weighted averages; apply
   exponential decay or recency weighting to reduce stale-signal influence.
3. **Composite Intelligence Score (CIS)**: Multiply domain scores by
   governance-defined weights and sum into the canonical CIS value.
4. **Qualitative Bands**: Map the CIS into qualitative bands (e.g., Platinum
   ≥0.85, Gold ≥0.70, Silver ≥0.55, Watchlist <0.55) to simplify downstream
   policy decisions and user messaging.
5. **Trigger Thresholds**: Emit structured events when CIS or domain scores
   cross thresholds—for example, burns for Watchlist modules and buybacks for
   Platinum performers.

### Benchmarking & Provenance

- Integrate ARC-AGI and domain-specific datasets; publish hashed benchmark
  inputs/outputs to IPFS or Arweave.
- Require signed attestations for all off-chain submissions; mismatched hashes
  trigger automated disputes.
- Maintain rolling historical windows for longitudinal analysis and anomaly
  detection.

## Tokenomics & Smart Contract Hooks

### Event-Driven Contract Logic

| Trigger              | Condition                                         | Contract Action                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance Burn     | CIS drops below Watchlist threshold for N epochs. | Oracle emits `PerformanceDegradation` → DCT contract burns % of module allocation. |
| Buyback & Reward     | Module sustains Platinum status for M epochs.     | Treasury contract schedules market buyback and rewards operator/stakers.           |
| Dynamic Pricing      | Domain score delta exceeds configured tolerance.  | Service pricing contract recalculates fees and updates bot/front-end access tiers. |
| Upgrade Verification | Upgrade submitted with hash `H`.                  | Oracle locks CIS updates until benchmark suite confirms ≥ configured uplift.       |

### TON Integration Patterns

- Leverage RedStone’s TON connector (or equivalent) for low-latency oracle feeds
  directly readable by TON smart contracts.
- Utilize TON message queues to notify service contracts and Telegram bots of
  score changes.
- Support Moralis/TonConnect bridges for multi-chain interoperability if AGI
  modules execute on EVM chains.

## Data Acquisition & Integrity

### Internal Pipelines

- **Service Telemetry**: Modules push signed JSON to the oracle ingest API;
  messages include wallet, module ID, metric payload, timestamp.
- **On-Chain Event Listeners**: Indexers monitor relevant contracts and relay
  verified transactions into the scoring datastore.
- **Benchmark Executors**: Scheduled jobs run evaluation suites; outputs signed
  by execution environment (TEEs or threshold-signature clusters).

### External Augmentation

- **Analytics Providers**: Optional integration with Nansen, Glassnode, Dune for
  market/user context; results pass through validation layer.
- **Community Feedback**: DAO-governed surveys or attestations recorded on-chain
  to prevent Sybil attacks.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Logs and benchmark artifacts pinned to IPFS/Arweave
  with references embedded in oracle events.

### Anti-Manipulation Controls

- Staking & slashing for oracle node operators and data providers.
- Duplicate/Sybil detection via signature uniqueness, wallet reputation, and
  proof-of-humanity integrations where applicable.
- Dispute resolution with challenger period before critical tokenomics actions
  execute.

## Governance Framework

- **DAO Oversight**: Token holders (or reputation-based councils) propose and
  ratify metric weights, thresholds, and onboarding of new domains.
- **Sub-DAOs**: Domain experts (trading, mentorship, education) maintain
  specialized metric catalogs subject to main DAO ratification.
- **Upgrade Flow**:
  1. Proposal submission with code diff, new weights, and risk analysis.
  2. Off-chain review window (audits, simulations).
  3. On-chain vote with quorum + supermajority requirements for breaking
     changes.
  4. Timelocked deployment and post-mortem report.
- **Transparency**: Publish all proposals, voting outcomes, and implementation
  notes within governance dashboards and repository changelogs.

## Interoperability Workflows

### Telegram Bots

- Bots query the oracle API or subscribed TON contracts to display module tiers,
  recent upgrades, and pricing.
- User actions (session start, feedback submission) produce signed receipts
  forwarded to the ingest API.
- Premium access logic references CIS tiers before unlocking advanced mentorship
  or trading signals.

### Service Modules

- Mentorship engines submit learning outcomes and satisfaction surveys directly;
  trading engines report executed trades with references to on-chain receipts.
- Education and self-improvement modules log credential issuance (soulbound
  NFTs, verifiable credentials) tied to wallet identities.
- Microservices share a common schema (OpenAPI/GraphQL) ensuring easy
  integration and versioning.

### Cross-Ecosystem Bridges

- Oracle scores can be mirrored to other chains via generalized messaging (e.g.,
  LayerZero) for external DeFi integrations or partner ecosystems.
- LayerZero v2 generalized messaging reference implementation:
  <https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero-v2> — study the canonical
  endpoints, security modules, and upgrade pattern before rolling out Dynamic
  Capital adapters.
- Maintain compatibility with existing Dynamic Capital dashboards, Supabase
  datasets, and analytics notebooks.

## Operational Checklists

### Data Onboarding Checklist

- [ ] Register module metadata (ID, owner wallet, service domain) with the
      oracle registry contract.
- [ ] Configure telemetry pipelines with signed payload schemas and replay
      protection.
- [ ] Schedule benchmark executors with published dataset hashes and
      reproducible runbooks.
- [ ] Verify decentralized storage pins (IPFS/Arweave) for logs and benchmark
      outputs.
- [ ] Establish dispute monitoring alerts for data integrity violations.

### Smart Contract Release Checklist

- [ ] Audit oracle interface contracts and TON connectors for new fields or
      methods.
- [ ] Simulate tokenomics triggers (burn, buyback, dynamic pricing) against
      sandbox CIS feeds.
- [ ] Configure timelocks and challenger windows before activating on mainnet.
- [ ] Publish deployment manifests, contract addresses, and ABI diffs to the
      governance portal.
- [ ] Run end-to-end rehearsal with Telegram bots and service modules consuming
      staging oracle data.

### Governance Cycle Checklist

- [ ] Draft proposal describing metric or weight change rationale, risk
      analysis, and mitigation plan.
- [ ] Circulate proposal for community review and gather expert commentary in
      relevant sub-DAOs.
- [ ] Execute on-chain vote with quorum tracking and automated result archival.
- [ ] Apply approved changes with timelocked deployment and post-change audit.
- [ ] Publish retrospective summarizing outcomes, detected issues, and next
      iteration actions.

## Security Posture

- **Threat Modeling**: Regularly assess oracle manipulation, data poisoning,
  replay attacks, and smart contract vulnerabilities.
- **Operational Security**: Enforce multi-sig access to oracle infrastructure,
  implement TEE or MPC signing where feasible, and require reproducible builds.
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Real-time anomaly detection on score deviations, node
  downtime, and contract events; alerts propagate to ops channels and DAOs.
- **Incident Response**: Documented runbooks for pausing tokenomics triggers,
  rolling back scores, and communicating with stakeholders.

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 0 – Research & Spec Finalization**: Validate metric catalog, data
   schemas, and governance blueprint with stakeholders.
2. **Phase 1 – Prototype Oracle**: Implement ingest API, scoring engine MVP, and
   TON connector integration; simulate tokenomics triggers on testnet.
3. **Phase 2 – Security Hardening**: Add threshold signatures, staking,
   slashing, and dispute workflows; conduct internal and third-party audits.
4. **Phase 3 – Production Rollout**: Deploy on mainnet, onboard initial AGI
   modules, and expose dashboards/Telegram bot integrations.
5. **Phase 4 – Continuous Improvement**: Expand metric coverage
   (self-improvement, collaborative intelligence), refine governance tooling,
   and publish quarterly transparency reports.
