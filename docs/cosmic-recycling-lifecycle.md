# Dynamic Recycling Optimization Playbook

The cosmic recycling loop illustrates how stars continuously refine raw elements into richer systems. Dynamic Capital mirrors that loop to turn early liquidity and contributor energy into durable treasury growth, sharper playbooks, and faster shipping cadences. Use this guide to translate each astrophysical stage into an operating motion with clear signals, owners, and compounding targets.

## Operating Principles

1. **Compounding Metallicity** — Every sprint should leave the ecosystem with more actionable telemetry, stronger treasury instruments, and higher contributor readiness.
2. **Closed-Loop Instrumentation** — Data must flow from ingestion → analysis → decision → reinforcement with no orphaned metrics.
3. **Incident Alchemy** — Treat major launches or failures as enrichment events that seed the next roadmap wave rather than as terminal outcomes.
4. **Governance Guardrails** — Gate heavier initiatives behind explicit stability, compliance, and liquidity checks to avoid premature complexity.

## Stage Playbook

| Cosmic Stage | Dynamic Capital Focus | Key Metrics | Automation & Signals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primordial Gas (H, He)** | Capture raw inflows across community, capital partners, and market signals. | Net new liquidity, contributor sign-ups, inbound deal volume. | Stream sentiment + inflow telemetry through `dynamic_recycling` ingestion, surface health in `dynamic_cosmic` dashboards. |
| **Protostar → Main Sequence** | Harden core infrastructure (custody, risk, observability) until stable. | Latency P95, custody availability, fraud false-positive rate. | Promote releases only when `dynamic_validator` guardrails pass; auto-block deploys when alert thresholds breach. |
| **Fusion Pathways** | Layer differentiating features (compliance automation, analytics, integrations). | Revenue per feature tier, partner activation rate, cycle time of new modules. | Orchestrate releases via `dynamic_cycle`; require scenario modeling in `dynamic_forecast`/`dynamic_energy` before fusing heavier elements. |
| **Stellar Winds & Supernovae** | Convert audits, launches, and incidents into ecosystem assets. | Post-event action completion, audit ROI, narrative reach. | Pipe retrospectives into `dynamic_review`, syndicate learnings via contributor portals and `dynamic_story` marketing cadences. |
| **Enriched ISM Collapse** | Reinforce the roadmap with enriched playbooks, liquidity strategy, and community programs. | Metallicity index (see below), treasury diversification, contributor competency scores. | Sync insights into `dynamic_memory_reconsolidation`; auto-update OKRs and liquidity tactics based on refreshed data. |

## Metallicity Index

Track the enrichment of the platform with a weighted score updated each sprint.

| Dimension | Weight | Measurement Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Telemetry Depth** | 30% | % of critical signals instrumented end-to-end, anomaly detection coverage, alert response time. |
| **Treasury Resilience** | 25% | Share of stable vs. experimental assets, liquidity runway, hedging coverage ratio. |
| **Contributor Fluency** | 20% | Training completion, incident participation rate, cross-team pairing hours. |
| **Ecosystem Reach** | 15% | Partner growth, marketing touchpoints, community engagement velocity. |
| **Innovation Velocity** | 10% | Sprint throughput, experiment success rate, iteration latency. |

> **Update cadence:** Refresh weights quarterly with the treasury and product councils; publish delta trends in `dynamic_cosmic` to visualize the compounding effect of each cycle.

## Instrumentation Pathways

1. **Inflow Sensing** — Route partner deposits, sentiment, and compliance flags into `dynamic_message_queue`; normalize tags so `dynamic_cosmic` can compare cycles.
2. **Core Stabilization** — Score latency, custody, and fraud metrics with `dynamic_engineer`; block promotion if thresholds drift outside green bands for two consecutive sprints.
3. **Differentiation Builds** — Stage analytics, governance, or automation modules as heavier-element tranches; gate each build with scenario modeling in `dynamic_forecast` and stress tests inside `dynamic_energy`.
4. **Event Harvesting** — Archive incident timelines and launch retros in `dynamic_memory`; convert the outcomes into internal + external narratives via `dynamic_story` tracks within 48 hours.
5. **Reinvestment Loop** — Feed refreshed runbooks, liquidity strategies, and marketing playbooks into growth sprints. Target a positive Metallicity Index delta every iteration.

## Roadmap Sequencing

| Phase | Objective | Exit Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 0 — Intake Calibration** | Instrument inflows, sentiment, and compliance data streams. | Unified metric definitions, `dynamic_recycling` pipeline SLAs met for two consecutive weeks. |
| **Phase 1 — Core Fusion Stability** | Harden custody, risk, and observability systems. | Latency, availability, and fraud metrics within target ranges; `dynamic_validator` guardrails active. |
| **Phase 2 — Heavy Element Expansion** | Launch differentiating modules and partner integrations. | Revenue uplift ≥ projected burn; partner activation above threshold; stress models signed off by treasury council. |
| **Phase 3 — Supernova Harvest** | Institutionalize post-launch learning loops. | Retros completed within 48 hours; action items tracked to closure in `dynamic_review`. |
| **Phase 4 — Metallicity Growth** | Reinvest insights to raise the Metallicity Index. | Index trending upward for three cycles; refreshed OKRs and liquidity playbooks published. |
