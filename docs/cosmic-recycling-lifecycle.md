# Cosmic Recycling Lifecycle Playbook

Cosmic recycling captures how star systems continuously forge, distribute, and
reuse matter. Dynamic Capital taps the same rhythm to compound treasury
strength, contributor knowledge, and shipping velocity. Treat each stellar stage
as a blueprint for shipping loops, telemetry feedback, and governance upgrades
that keep the platform cycling forward.

## Stage-to-Platform Mapping

| Cosmic Stage                       | Astrophysical Dynamics                                            | Dynamic Capital Lens                                                                          | Implementation Signals                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primordial Gas (H, He)**         | Cold molecular clouds collapse under gravity to form protostars.  | Raw community energy, market inputs, and liquidity partners entering the funnel.              | Capture inflow metrics in `dynamic_recycling` ingestion jobs and surface sentiment telemetry in `dynamic_cosmic` dashboards. |
| **Protostar → Main Sequence Star** | Accretion and ignition stabilize sustained fusion.                | Core infrastructure (custody, risk, observability) reaching production maturity.              | Promote features from staging only after `dynamic_validator` guardrails and alerting thresholds pass acceptance.             |
| **Fusion Pathways**                | Sequential fusion generates heavier elements up to iron.          | Iterative feature growth: compliance modules, analytics layers, partner integrations.         | Use release cadences governed by `dynamic_cycle` to avoid fusing "heavier" initiatives before the core metrics are stable.   |
| **Stellar Winds & Supernovae**     | Catastrophic events eject metals into the interstellar medium.    | Major launches, audits, or incidents releasing learnings and capital back into the ecosystem. | Run post-event retrospectives via `dynamic_review` and pipe artifacts into contributor portals.                              |
| **Enriched ISM Collapse**          | Metal-rich clouds birth the next generation of stars and planets. | Reinvested telemetry, treasury returns, and storytelling powering the next roadmap wave.      | Feed insights into `dynamic_memory_reconsolidation` to update playbooks, OKRs, and liquidity strategy.                       |

## Fusion Stack Reference

```
H → He → C, O → … → Fe
```

- **Platform cue:** escalate experiments only when upstream stability (H → He)
  has persisted across two quality gates.
- **Revenue cue:** heavier "metal" features should unlock new treasury or fee
  streams before proceeding to the next fusion layer.

## Feedback Cycle Instrumentation

1. **Inflow Sensing** — Use `dynamic_message_queue` pipelines to log partner
   deposits, user sentiment, and compliance flags as the "primordial" intake.
2. **Core Stabilization** — Validate baseline KPIs (latency, custody
   availability, fraud detection) with `dynamic_engineer` scorecards before
   declaring a module main sequence ready.
3. **Differentiation Builds** — Stage analytics, governance, or multi-LLM
   automation as the heavier-element tranche. Gate each build with scenario
   modeling in `dynamic_forecast` and `dynamic_energy` stress simulations.
4. **Event Harvesting** — Capture audits, launches, or incidents as "supernova"
   events. Archive incident timelines in `dynamic_memory` and convert the
   outcomes into public-facing narratives within `dynamic_story` (marketing)
   tracks.
5. **Reinvestment Loop** — Feed improved runbooks, liquidity strategies, and
   marketing playbooks back into growth sprints. The objective is higher
   "metallicity": more resilient contributors, diversified liquidity, and richer
   onboarding stories every cycle.

## Operational Checklist

- [ ] **Primordial Intake Ready:**
  - [ ] Partner, community, and liquidity inflows instrumented with shared
        metrics definitions.
  - [ ] Sentiment tags normalized so `dynamic_cosmic` visualizations can compare
        cycles.
- [ ] **Core Fusion Stability:**
  - [ ] Custody, compliance, and risk monitors hold steady for two consecutive
        sprints.
  - [ ] Post-incident reviews within `dynamic_review` closed with action items
        assigned.
- [ ] **Heavy Element Expansion:**
  - [ ] Advanced modules (cross-chain, analytics, multi-LLM tooling) gated by
        measurable uplifts.
  - [ ] Treasury council signs off on projected burn vs. return using
        `dynamic_budget` models.
- [ ] **Supernova Learnings Captured:**
  - [ ] Launch or incident summaries published internally within 48 hours.
  - [ ] Key lessons seeded into onboarding and marketing collateral.
- [ ] **Metallicity Growth Metrics:**
  - [ ] Track contributor readiness, treasury diversification, and ecosystem
        partnerships to quantify enrichment.
  - [ ] Compare current cycle KPIs against prior rotations to confirm
        compounding progress.

## Key Takeaway

Every Dynamic Capital sprint should leave the ecosystem richer—more telemetry,
more resilient treasury flows, and better contributor fluency—just as each
stellar generation increases universal metallicity. Treat the cosmic recycling
loop as the operational north star guiding roadmap prioritization and
storytelling.
