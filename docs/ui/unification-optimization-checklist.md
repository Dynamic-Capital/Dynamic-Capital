# Dynamic UI Unification & Optimization Checklist

Use this checklist to coordinate theme, interaction, and performance refinements
for the Dynamic UI system. Group tasks by phase to ensure the quick wins land
first while the medium- and long-term optimizations follow a shared roadmap.

## Phase 1 · Quick Wins

### Enhanced Color System & Visual Hierarchy

- [ ] Add semantic success, warning, info, and neutral tokens across light/dark
      themes.
- [ ] Audit component states for WCAG AA color contrast and document any
      required palette adjustments.
- [ ] Introduce warm/cool temperature variants that can be toggled by time of
      day or market session.
- [ ] Map contextual market signals (bull/bear/volatile) to dynamic brand color
      ramps and verify gradients render cleanly in `dynamic-ui.css`.

### Micro-interactions & Touch Targets

- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements expose hover, focus-visible, pressed, and
      disabled affordances with motion-safe fallbacks.
- [ ] Add loading, success, and error feedback states to high-traffic buttons
      and forms.
- [ ] Increase touch target sizing (min 44×44 px) and gesture responsiveness for
      mobile and Telegram surfaces.

## Phase 2 · Market & Performance Adaptations

### Market-Responsive & Geographic Themes

- [ ] Implement theme variants that respond to live market conditions (bull,
      bear, sideways, high volatility) and provide a toggle for QA overrides.
- [ ] Create Maldivian-inspired palettes/typography pairs and document cultural
      references used for reviewers.
- [ ] Add device performance profiles (high fidelity vs. lightweight) with
      fallbacks for low-end hardware.
- [ ] Deliver accessibility themes (high contrast, reduced motion, large type)
      and integrate them with Supabase theme persistence.

### Smart Components & Content Hierarchy

- [ ] Extend button/card components with contextual props to surface market
      status, trading signals, or user alerts without ad-hoc overrides.
- [ ] Implement progressive disclosure patterns (accordion, detail toggles)
      driven by behavioral analytics or saved preferences.
- [ ] Wire micro-copy and tooltip helpers to adapt based on user tier or
      experience level.
- [ ] Localize Dhivehi content with RTL verification and typography QA for key
      flows.

### Performance & Loading Improvements

- [ ] Profile CSS custom property usage and consolidate redundant calculations
      in the branding tokens.
- [ ] Add component-level lazy loading for TradingView widgets, analytics
      panels, and other heavy bundles.
- [ ] Refine animation primitives to rely on transform/opacity and respect the
      `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
- [ ] Optimize theme hydration so persisted themes flash less than 100 ms on
      cold loads (measure with Web Vitals).

## Phase 3 · Advanced Personalization & Visualization

### Data Visualization Enhancements

- [ ] Align TradingView embeds with Dynamic UI theming (colors, fonts,
      indicators) and remove redundant inline styling.
- [ ] Prototype native chart components for core KPIs with consistent motion
      tokens and accessibility annotations.
- [ ] Surface real-time market/portfolio indicators with throttled updates and
      skeleton fallbacks.
- [ ] Introduce comparative visualization modes (asset vs. index, portfolio vs.
      benchmark) with synchronized tooltips.

### Adaptive Layout & Dashboard Customization

- [ ] Build a content-aware grid that adjusts column count and spacing based on
      data density and screen size.
- [ ] Add user-configurable dashboard layouts (drag-and-drop or saved presets)
      with persistence in Supabase.
- [ ] Implement spacing tokens that adapt to hierarchy depth (e.g., nested cards
      vs. top-level containers).
- [ ] Document layout rules in the design system reference and update Storybook
      or MDX examples accordingly.

### Personalization & Context Engines

- [ ] Ship AI-assisted or rules-based content prioritization that ranks modules
      (news, signals, portfolio) per user behavior.
- [ ] Build contextual help overlays that adapt copy and links based on user
      confidence scores or completion history.
- [ ] Integrate cross-surface telemetry to refine theme and layout
      recommendations over time.
- [ ] Establish validation checkpoints (design review, accessibility audit,
      performance budget) before promoting advanced features to production.

## Ongoing Governance

- [ ] Maintain a living inventory of theme tokens, component variants, and
      visualization templates in `dynamic-branding.config.ts` and supporting
      docs.
- [ ] Schedule quarterly audits to reconcile design tokens, CSS variables, and
      component props to avoid drift.
- [ ] Track completion status in the project board and link PRs/issues so
      reviewers can trace each checklist item to measurable outcomes.
- [ ] Capture learnings post-launch (metrics, accessibility findings,
      localization feedback) and feed them back into the roadmap.
