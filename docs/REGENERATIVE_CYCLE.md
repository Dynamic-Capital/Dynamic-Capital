# Regenerative Cycle Completeness Checklist

To operate a full regenerative lifecycle inside Dynamic Capital, the cycle blueprint needs to be coupled with four adaptive subsystems. These layers ensure each loop can sense, respond, and evolve with its environment instead of simply repeating the same playbook.

## dynamic_immune — Threat Awareness and Neutralisation
- Detect systemic anomalies, exploits, or toxic behaviours across the network.
- Provide automated countermeasures and escalation pathways so shocks are contained quickly.
- Feed incident telemetry back into cycle analytics to harden future iterations.

## dynamic_respiration — Information Exchange
- Manage the inflow and outflow of critical signals (market data, news, cultural shifts).
- Balance information intake so the organisation neither suffocates nor becomes overwhelmed.
- Synchronise with external intelligence feeds to keep the cycle contextually aware.

## dynamic_ecosystem — Interdependence Modelling
- Map relationships between internal modules, user cohorts, and external protocols.
- Encourage biodiversity in strategies and participants to avoid monocultures.
- Simulate cascading impacts before new policies or deployments are rolled out.

## dynamic_memory — Long-Term Learning
- Maintain longitudinal knowledge similar to biological neural plasticity.
- Store reflections, retrospectives, and post-mortems from prior cycles.
- Surface pattern intelligence to inform adaptive planning in the next iteration.

Bringing these modules online closes the loop between detection, respiration, adaptation, and learning—unlocking a genuinely regenerative operating rhythm.
