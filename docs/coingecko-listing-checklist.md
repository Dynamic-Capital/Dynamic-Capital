# CoinGecko Listing Readiness Checklist

Use this checklist to confirm Dynamic Capital has everything CoinGecko requires
before submitting the token listing request. Gather verifiable evidence
(screenshots, explorer URLs, signed PDFs) for each item so the application
reviewer can validate details without back-and-forth emails.

> [!TIP]
> Maintain a shared folder that mirrors this checklist. Store supporting
> evidence, form drafts, and correspondence in sub-folders that match the
> section titles below so the operations team can hand off the package quickly.
