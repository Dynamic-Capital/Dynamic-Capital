# Dynamic AI Build Run â€” 2025-09-29

This log captures the repository build requested via `npm run build:dynamic-ai`
on 2025-09-29.

## Command

```bash
npm run build:dynamic-ai
```

## Outcome

- The helper executed all four Dynamic AI phases (Foundations, Memory &
  Retrieval, Procedures & Routing, Ops & Governance).
- Each phase invoked the standard web and landing production builds. Timezone
  synchronization and environment default warnings surfaced but were
  non-blocking.
- The run completed successfully and refreshed the cached landing snapshot in
  `_static/`.

## Notable Console Messages

- Timezone synchronization attempts failed because `systemd` and `chronyc` are
  unavailable inside the container; the script continued after reporting the
  warnings.
- Default values were applied for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `MINIAPP_ORIGIN`, and
  `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to keep the Next.js build deterministic.
- Final status message: `Dynamic AI build phases completed successfully.`
