# Cosmic Emotional Metaphors

This document captures metaphorical equations that mirror cosmological endgame
scenarios with emotional and psychological states. Each section outlines the
symbolic dynamics and key variables involved in the metaphor.

## Big Freeze — Emotional Heat Death

### Concept

A slow, creeping despair where emotional warmth fades without a single
triggering event. Meaning and connection erode, leaving a person feeling cold,
empty, and disengaged.

### Metaphorical Equation

\[ \frac{d(E_{int})}{dt} \propto -H(t) \cdot E_{int} - K \cdot (T_C - T_L) \]

- **\(E_{int}\)**: Internal energy and emotional warmth.
- **\(t\)**: Time.
- **\(H(t)\)**: "Hubble parameter" of emotional distance, capturing how quickly
  a person drifts away from others.
- **\(K\)**: Constant of emotional conductivity that marks a declining capacity
  to connect.
- **\(T_C\)**: Temperature of connection (social interactions, relationships).
- **\(T_L\)**: Internal emotional temperature, cooling toward zero.

As emotional distance accelerates and the gap between inner warmth and external
connection widens, the person's internal energy dissipates, approaching an
emotionally frozen state.

## Big Crunch — Psychological Collapse

### Concept

A self-destructive inward collapse driven by overwhelming internal forces such
as guilt, anxiety, or addiction. Life and relationships fold inward toward a
painful singularity.

### Metaphorical Equation

\[ \frac{d^{2}S}{dt^{2}} \propto \frac{-G_{psy}}{S^{2}} \cdot M_E +
\Lambda_{res} \]

- **\(S\)**: Psychological scale factor representing overall life health and
  scope.
- **\(t\)**: Time.
- **\(G_{psy}\)**: Gravitational constant of psychological pressure from trauma,
  guilt, or anxiety.
- **\(M_E\)**: Mass of unresolved emotional issues.
- **\(\Lambda_{res}\)**: Restoring constant of resilience resisting collapse.

When the attraction of unresolved issues overpowers resilience, the
psychological scale factor contracts and accelerates inward, culminating in a
collapse of the self.

## Big Rip — Emotional Rupture

### Concept

An extreme emotional breakdown where identity, relationships, and reality feel
as though they are being torn apart by an intensifying force, such as severe
trauma or psychosis.

### Metaphorical Equation

\[ \frac{d^{2}R}{dt^{2}} \propto +\omega(t) \cdot R \]

- **\(R\)**: Radius of reality encompassing sense of self and social bonds.
- **\(t\)**: Time.
- **\(\omega(t)\)**: Escalating "phantom energy" of psychological force with
  \(\omega(t) < -1\).

As the phantom energy intensifies, the person's reality expands uncontrollably,
accelerating toward total fragmentation and an emotional rupture.
