# Dynamic Unified Multi-Layer Model

This note captures the nested structure of the Dynamic Unified Multi-Layer Model
and explains how each scale influences the next.

## Core Update Equation

The model evolves density-like quantity \(D\) through time according to:

```math
D_{t+1} = a(t+1) \cdot \left[D_t + \beta D_t \Delta T_t + \hbar \frac{\Delta t}{m D_t}\right]
```

- \(a(t+1)\) is the cosmic scaling factor that stretches the system at the next
  time step.
- \(D_t\) is the current state of the material density.
- \(\beta D_t \Delta T_t\) expresses thermal expansion driven by energy exchange
  over the time step.
- \(\hbar \frac{\Delta t}{m D_t}\) encodes quantum-scale fluctuations, keeping
  matter intrinsically fuzzy.

## Layered Interpretation

The model behaves like a set of nested layers, reminiscent of Russian dolls:

1. **Quantum layer** – Particles are never perfectly still. Quantum uncertainty
   injects "micro ripples" represented by the Planck-constant term.
2. **Thermal layer** – Energy input or loss modifies the structure of matter,
   adding "middle tides" that swell or contract the state via temperature
   change.
3. **Cosmic layer** – Cosmological expansion stretches the entire arrangement,
   acting as an "ocean current" that transports every lower layer together.

Each inner layer feeds its output to the next larger one, producing a unified
evolution that spans microscopic to cosmological scales.
