# Project Efficiency Playbook

Efficient development in Dynamic Capital relies on three pillars: faster builds,
predictable environments, and targeted validation. This playbook consolidates
repo-specific tactics that keep shipping velocity high without sacrificing
quality.

## 1. Build & Bundle Optimization

- **Use the staged build scripts**: `npm run build:web` and
  `npm run build:landing` are already wrapped in `scripts/npm-safe.mjs`, which
  propagates the correct workspace context. Avoid running `next build`
  directlyâ€”leveraging the wrapper ensures shared environment variables and
  workspace caching are respected.
- **Analyze bundles before shipping**: Run `npm run build:web` followed by
  `npm run build:web -- --analyze` (Next.js option) to identify heavy routes.
  Move shared UI into `@/components` and replace large dependencies with lighter
  equivalents when the analyzer flags >200 kB gzip bundles.
- **Enable persistent caching locally**: Set `NEXT_CACHE_DIR=.next/cache` inside
  `.env.local` so that incremental Next.js builds reuse artifacts between runs.
  Pair this with `npm run build:dev` when iterating on SSR logic to catch
  regressions without a full production build.

## 2. Dependency Hygiene

- **Prune unused packages**: After major feature work, run `npx depcheck` to
  surface dead dependencies in `apps/web`. Remove unused packages and rerun
  `npm install` to shrink the lockfile and Docker layers.
- **Lock critical versions**: High-churn libraries like `@langchain/*` and
  `supabase` can introduce breaking changes. Prefer pinning versions in
  `package.json` and update with `npm update <pkg> --depth 0` during scheduled
  maintenance windows.
- **Audit third-party risk**: The repo ships with `npm run audit` and
  `npm run audit:fix`. Schedule the audit script in CI or cron to minimize
  security-driven rework.

## 3. Targeted Validation Workflow

- **Stick to the focused quality gates**: Before opening a PR, run the trio
  `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run test`. These map to the App
  Router code paths and prevent slow full-verify runs.
- **Use `npm run verify` sparingly**: The verify script triggers cross-language
  pipelines and can take several minutes. Reserve it for release branches or
  infrastructure edits.
- **Leverage Vitest filters**: When editing isolated utilities under `src/`, run
  `npm run test -- --run tests/path/to/file.test.ts` to avoid the full suite.

## 4. Environment & CI Tips

- **Share `.env.example` updates**: Whenever a new environment variable is
  introduced, update `.env.example` and run `npm run env:report` to document the
  delta. This prevents onboarding churn.
- **Cache Docker layers**: When building the production container, pre-run
  `npm run build:tooling` to compile TypeScript tooling binaries. The Dockerfile
  can then copy the prebuilt artifacts instead of recompiling on each build.
- **Use `scripts/npm-safe.mjs` in CI**: This wrapper injects the correct
  workspace and reproduces local behavior. Calling workspace scripts directly
  inside CI can break symlinked dependencies.

## 5. Monitoring & Feedback Loops

- **Track bundle metrics over time**: Export the analyzer JSON into
  `_static/metrics/` (ignored from deployment) and compare diffs during code
  review. Significant jumps signal code splitting opportunities.
- **Collect perf telemetry from the Mini App**: Hook `@vercel/otel` custom
  traces into user-critical flows (deposit creation, KYC upload) and monitor P95
  latencies. Use the insights to prioritize optimization work.
- **Review cron job durations**: The automation scripts under `scripts/` often
  target Supabase and TON APIs. Add logging around start/end times and route
  them to the existing monitoring stack so regressions are caught quickly.

Maintaining efficiency is continuous work. Pair these practices with routine
retrospectives on the build pipeline, and document any deviations inside `docs/`
so the team stays aligned.
