# Dynamic Capital Monte Carlo Method Playbook

## Core Concept
- The Monte Carlo method approximates complex analytical solutions through random sampling.
- Inspired by Stanislaw Ulam's solitaire experiments: when exact win probabilities were intractable, he relied on repeated gameplay and the fraction of wins as an empirical estimate.
- Foundations:
  - Randomness drives the sampling process.
  - The Law of Large Numbers ensures empirical averages converge to the true expectation as trials increase.

## General Algorithm
1. **Define the problem** – translate the real-world scenario into a probabilistic model (e.g., "What is the probability of winning solitaire?").
2. **Generate random inputs** – construct the random process (shuffle cards, sample dice outcomes, draw from distributions).
3. **Run simulations** – execute the experiment repeatedly (thousands of games, millions of samples).
4. **Collect outcomes** – record relevant results such as win/loss indicators or numerical payoffs.
5. **Estimate the result** – compute averages or proportions: \(\hat{p} = \frac{\text{# Successes}}{\text{# Trials}}\).
6. **Increase accuracy** – expand the number of trials; convergence is guaranteed by the Law of Large Numbers.

## Key Formula
For a random variable \(X\) with expected value \(\mu = \mathbb{E}[X]\):
\[
\mu \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i
\]
where each \(X_i\) is an independent sample from \(X\).

## Classic Examples
### Dice Simulation
- **Question:** What is the probability that two dice sum to at least 10?
- **Process:** Roll the dice many times, count the occurrences where the sum is \( \geq 10 \), and estimate the probability as the observed frequency.

### Solitaire
- Simulate thousands of solitaire games and measure the fraction of wins to approximate the win probability.

### Estimating \(\pi\)
- Uniformly sample points inside a unit square.
- Count how many fall within the inscribed quarter-circle.
- Estimate: \( \pi \approx 4 \times \frac{\text{points inside circle}}{\text{total points}} \).

## Applications
- **Physics:** nuclear reaction modeling, particle transport.
- **Finance:** risk assessment, option pricing (e.g., Black–Scholes).
- **AI & ML:** Monte Carlo Tree Search (e.g., AlphaGo).
- **Statistics:** Bayesian inference, numerical integration.
- **Engineering:** reliability analysis, optimization studies.

## Practical Playbook
1. **Problem setup** – define the state space and operational rules.
2. **Random generation** – design the sampling procedure or pseudo-random generator usage.
3. **Run simulations** – execute \(N\) trials; higher \(N\) improves stability.
4. **Collect data** – store outcomes such as success/failure flags or payoff values.
5. **Estimate and refine** – compute means, proportions, or integrals; increase \(N\) to shrink error.

## Quick Reference
- **Estimator:** \( \hat{\mu}_N = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} f(X_i) \).
- **Error shrinkage:** standard error declines proportionally to \(N^{-1/2}\).
  - 100 trials → coarse estimate.
  - 10,000 trials → substantially improved precision.

## Summary
Monte Carlo methods transform complex analytical questions into random experiments. By repeatedly sampling, recording outcomes, and averaging the results, practitioners obtain reliable approximations even when closed-form solutions are unattainable.
