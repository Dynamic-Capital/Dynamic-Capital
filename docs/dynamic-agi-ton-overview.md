# Dynamic AGI x TON Ecosystem Overview

## Project Overview

- **Dynamic Capital** fuses an adaptive AGI research stack with TON-native Web3
  infrastructure to serve Maldivian traders through a Telegram-first experience.
- The platform orchestrates trading insights, pooled mentorship, and tokenized
  access from a single Dynamic Capital Token (DCT) economy.
- Every surface — Telegram bot, Mini App, smart contracts, and analytics engines
  — is designed for rapid iteration while preserving compliance and risk
  controls.

## Core Components

- **Dynamic Capital Token (DCT):** Utility token that unlocks premium
  intelligence feeds, governance votes, and staking programs linked to
  mentorship pools.
- **Telegram Bot & Mini App:** Front-line trader interface delivering onboarding
  flows, actionable signals, and direct access to staking or liquidity programs.
- **Supabase & Data Infrastructure:** Unified telemetry, user state, and risk
  metrics powering personalized recommendations and compliance checkpoints.
- **Dynamic Intelligence Layer:** Multi-model orchestration framework combining
  LLM strategy generation, historical market memory, and guardrail policies.
- **Automation & Ops Fabric:** Workflow engines, observability pipelines, and
  compliance automation that keep on-chain and off-chain actions synchronized.

## Telegram Mini App Features

- **Onboarding & Identity:** Embedded KYC capture, wallet linking, and
  fiat/crypto deposit verification optimized for mobile bandwidth.
- **Trading Dashboards:** Market sentiment heatmaps, curated signal feeds, and
  performance analytics driven by the Dynamic Intelligence Layer.
- **Staking & Pool Access:** Seamless entry into DCT staking, mentorship pools,
  and social trading cohorts with real-time TVL updates.
- **Notifications & Support:** Event-driven alerts for trade execution, pool
  status, and governance proposals plus direct access to support agents.

## Intelligence Stack

- **Cognitive Memory Mesh:** Long-term knowledge base that blends market
  archives, mentorship playbooks, and regulatory notes into retrievable context.
- **Adaptive Strategy Engine:** Ensemble of LLMs and quantitative models tuned
  for Maldivian liquidity patterns and trader profiles.
- **Risk Sentinel:** Guardrail subsystem enforcing stop-loss policies, treasury
  exposure limits, and AML/CTF heuristics before orders are released.
- **Mentorship Copilot:** Agentic workflow pairing mentors with mentees,
  summarizing sessions, and feeding anonymized insights back into the strategy
  engine.

## Web3 & TON Integration

- **TON Smart Contracts:** DCT-powered contracts manage staking pools, automated
  liquidity rotation, NFT access badges, and token-gated governance modules.
- **Wallet & Payment Bridges:** Native TON wallet support plus fiat settlement
  bridges that reconcile deposits with on-chain activity.
- **Analytics & Compliance:** Transaction indexing, real-time proof-of-reserve
  attestations, and anomaly detection across TON-ledger interactions.
- **Ecosystem Partnerships:** Integrations with TON DeFi pools, NFT
  marketplaces, and oracle providers to extend liquidity and data surface area.

## Next Steps

- Formalize mentorship pool tokenomics and publish staking APR models aligned
  with TON yield curves.
- Expand Mini App roadmap with localized payment options, Malayalam-language
  support, and mentor discovery UX.
- Harden on-chain monitoring by instrumenting proof-of-reserve attestations and
  anomaly alerts for treasury operations.
