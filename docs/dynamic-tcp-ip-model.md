# Dynamic TCP/IP Model Overview

## Internet Stack Architecture

- **Purpose:** Explain how Dynamic Capital infrastructure leverages the
  Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite to move data
  between distributed services and end users.
- **Four Core Layers:**
  1. **Application Layer** – Hosts user-facing services and protocols such as
     HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, and DHCP. Interfaces with product experiences,
     trading dashboards, and automation endpoints.
  2. **Transport Layer** – Provides end-to-end data delivery using TCP for
     reliable, ordered communication or UDP for latency-sensitive flows.
  3. **Internet Layer** – Handles packet addressing and routing through IP and
     auxiliary protocols like ARP.
  4. **Network Access Layer** – Covers the physical and data link mechanisms
     (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, fiber) that transmit frames over local and wide-area
     networks.

## Transport Layer Protocols

- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** Connection-oriented, ensures ordered
  and error-checked delivery with retransmissions and acknowledgements.
  - _Dynamic Capital usage:_ Mission-critical API calls, trading order
    submissions, web app sessions, and secure remote administration.
- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP):** Connectionless, minimal overhead, no
  delivery guarantees, optimized for real-time performance.
  - _Dynamic Capital usage:_ Market data streaming, time-sensitive analytics,
    and collaborative media flows where freshness matters more than occasional
    loss.

## Application Layer Protocols

- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Power browser-to-server interactions. HTTPS adds TLS
  encryption for confidentiality and integrity.
- **FTP:** Facilitates bulk file exchange for research datasets or historical
  trading logs.
- **DNS:** Resolves human-readable service names (e.g., `api.dynamic.capital`)
  into routable IP addresses.
- **DHCP:** Automates IP address assignment, subnet configuration, and gateway
  distribution across lab networks and edge nodes.

## Internet Layer Protocols

- **IP (IPv4/IPv6):** Supplies global addressing, packet fragmentation, and
  routing logic. Every server, agent node, and workstation receives a unique IP
  identifier.
- **ARP:** Maps IP addresses to Media Access Control (MAC) addresses within
  local segments so frames reach the correct hardware destination.

## OSI Reference Model Alignment

| OSI Layer        | Function                                                             | TCP/IP Corollary               | Operational Notes                                                                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7 – Application  | Interfaces for user workflows, agent services, and automation hooks. | Application Layer              | Tailor APIs, dashboards, and knowledge surfaces for traders, mentors, and orchestration agents. |
| 6 – Presentation | Data formatting, encryption, compression.                            | Application Layer              | Enforce TLS, content negotiation, and serialization standards.                                  |
| 5 – Session      | Connection lifecycle management.                                     | Application & Transport Layers | Maintain API sessions, WebSocket upgrades, and cross-agent workflow contexts.                   |
| 4 – Transport    | Reliable delivery and flow control.                                  | Transport Layer                | Tune TCP congestion windows and apply QUIC/UDP where low latency is paramount.                  |
| 3 – Network      | Logical addressing and routing.                                      | Internet Layer                 | Design multi-region subnets, BGP peering, and SD-WAN overlays.                                  |
| 2 – Data Link    | Node-to-node transfer, error detection.                              | Network Access Layer           | Standardize on Ethernet, 802.11, or private 5G with VLAN segregation.                           |
| 1 – Physical     | Cables, radio, optical media.                                        | Network Access Layer           | Provision redundant fiber, satellite backup, and structured cabling.                            |

## IP Addressing and DNS Lifecycle

1. **Address Allocation:** DHCP assigns IP parameters for internal labs while
   static IPs anchor edge gateways, VPN concentrators, and production clusters.
2. **Name Resolution:** DNS records translate product and infrastructure domains
   to the appropriate IPs, enabling seamless endpoint discovery.
3. **Packet Delivery:** Transport and internet layer protocols encapsulate
   application data into packets routed across the WAN or internet.
4. **Session Continuity:** TCP ensures packets arrive in sequence; UDP-based
   workloads implement application-level compensation for occasional loss.

## Operational Checklist

- Document all critical services with both DNS entries and static IP fallbacks.
- Monitor TCP/UDP port health and latency across regions.
- Rotate TLS certificates and DNSSEC signing keys to preserve trust boundaries.
- Validate DHCP scopes and reservation tables before deploying new hardware.
- Capture ARP tables and traceroutes during incident response to accelerate root
  cause analysis.
