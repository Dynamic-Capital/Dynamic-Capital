# Quantum Expansion Equation

## Overview

The quantum expansion equation models how a particle's effective spatial spread
evolves over time when quantum uncertainty, thermal agitation, and the
large-scale expansion of spacetime all contribute simultaneously. It extends
classical diffusion by embedding the dynamics in an expanding cosmological
background while preserving micro-scale thermal and quantum effects.

## Assumptions and Validity

- \(D_t\) represents a characteristic length scale (e.g., standard deviation of
  a Gaussian wave packet). The recurrence assumes this scale remains positive
  and differentiable over the integration window.
- Temperature perturbations are encoded through a lumped coefficient \(\beta\)
  and discrete increment \(\Delta T_t\); latent heat or phase-transition
  effects are abstracted into the choice of \(\beta\).
- The scale factor \(a(t)\) is supplied exogenously—typically from a
  cosmological solver or prescribed laboratory control—and is sufficiently
  smooth that \(a(t+1)\) is well approximated at the discrete time resolution.
- Quantum diffusion enters via a lowest-order semiclassical correction; higher
  order tunneling or interaction terms are aggregated into an optional
  extension \(f_q\).

## Core Recurrence

\[ D_{t+1} = a(t+1) \cdot \Big[ D_t + \beta D_t \Delta T_t + \hbar \frac{\Delta
t}{m D_t} \Big] \]

Where:

- \(D_{t+1}\) – effective spread (e.g., wave packet width) at the next state.
- \(a(t+1)\) – cosmic scale factor describing the macroscopic expansion of
  spacetime.
- \(\beta D_t \Delta T_t\) – thermally driven change in spread from local
  vibrations or heat exchange.
- \(\hbar\) – reduced Planck constant introducing Heisenberg uncertainty.
- \(m\) – particle mass.
- \(\frac{\hbar \Delta t}{m D_t}\) – diffusion term associated with free
  wavefunction spreading.

## Term Breakdown

1. **Thermal contribution (\(\beta D_t \Delta T_t\))**
   - Captures stochastic spread induced by temperature gradients and collisions.
   - Dominant for mesoscopic systems where thermal agitation overwhelms quantum
     or cosmological effects.
2. **Cosmic expansion (\(a(t+1)\))**
   - Scales the entire bracketed micro-state update by the background expansion
     of spacetime.
   - Relevant for astrophysical or cosmological simulations that track particles
     over cosmological timescales.
3. **Quantum diffusion (\(\hbar \frac{\Delta t}{m D_t}\))**
   - Represents intrinsic wave packet spreading.
   - Mirrors the free-particle variance evolution \(\sigma(t) = \sqrt{
     \sigma_0^2 + \frac{\hbar^2 t^2}{m^2 \sigma_0^2} }\).
   - Dominant for light particles (e.g., electrons, photons) or ultra-cold
     regimes where thermal agitation is suppressed.

## Multi-scale Interpretation

| Regime | Dominant Terms | Typical Diagnostics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Everyday matter | Thermal | Compare against diffusion coefficients, phonon spectra |
| Astrophysical bodies | Cosmic | Track coherence lengths across Hubble times |
| Quantum systems | Quantum diffusion | Monitor uncertainty-product saturation |
| Extreme environments | Thermal + cosmic + quantum | Evaluate curvature coupling, entropy flux |

The table highlights how the weighting between contributions informs which
observables should be monitored during simulation or experimentation.

## Simulation Workflow

1. Initialize \(D_0\) from experimental or theoretical priors (e.g., ground-state
   widths, thermal de Broglie wavelengths).
2. Choose a cosmological model to supply \(a(t)\); for astrophysical contexts
   this may be a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) solution, while
   laboratory systems typically fix \(a(t) = 1\).
3. Select thermodynamic and quantum parameters \(\beta, \Delta T_t, m\) and
   time-step size \(\Delta t\).
4. Iterate the recurrence, updating \(D_t\) and recording observables such as
   variance, entropy, or decoherence metrics.
5. Calibrate model coefficients by comparing simulated spreads with empirical
   measurements (e.g., diffraction data, cosmological surveys).

### Reference Implementation Skeleton

```python
for step in range(num_steps):
    thermal = beta * D[step] * delta_T[step]
    quantum = hbar * dt / (mass * D[step])
    micro_update = D[step] + thermal + quantum + f_q_extra(step)
    D[step + 1] = scale_factor(step + 1) * micro_update
    enforce_bounds(D, step + 1)
    log_observables(D, step + 1)
```

Supplement the skeleton with adaptive-stepping logic and robust boundary guards
for \(D_t\) as discussed below.

## Optimization Strategies

### Adaptive Time-stepping

- Vary \(\Delta t\) based on a local truncation error estimate to maintain
  accuracy near stiff regimes (e.g., \(D_t \to 0\)).
- Couple adaptive stepping with reject/redo logic to prevent divergence when the
  quantum diffusion term spikes.

### Constraint Enforcement

- Enforce lower bounds \(D_t \geq D_{\min}\) derived from physical priors or
  experimental resolution to avoid singular denominators.
- Apply projection methods that rescale \(D_t\) back onto feasible manifolds if
  large fluctuations violate conservation laws or known asymptotics.

### Precomputation and Parallelism

- Precompute temperature and scale-factor schedules when they evolve slowly to
  reduce per-step overhead.
- Vectorize the recurrence across particle ensembles and distribute workloads on
  GPUs or multi-node clusters for Monte Carlo studies.

### Model Reduction and Surrogates

- Fit surrogate models (e.g., neural operators, reduced-order bases) to the
  high-fidelity recurrence outputs for rapid parameter sweeps.
- Use sensitivity analysis or automatic differentiation to identify dominant
  parameters and prune negligible interactions in \(f_q\).

### Dimensionless Formulation

- Introduce a characteristic scale \(D_*\) (e.g., initial spread) and time scale
  \(t_*\) to construct \(\hat{D}_t = D_t / D_*\) and \(\hat{t} = t / t_*\).
- The recurrence becomes
  \[
  \hat{D}_{t+1} = a(t+1) \Big[ \hat{D}_t + \hat{\beta} \hat{D}_t \Delta \hat{T}_t
  + \frac{\epsilon}{\hat{D}_t} \Big],
  \]
  where \(\hat{\beta} = \beta \Delta T_t\) and \(\epsilon = \hbar \Delta t /
  (m D_*^2)\).
- Working with dimensionless groups stabilizes numerical ranges, clarifies
  parameter sensitivity, and facilitates cross-system comparisons.

## Implementation Notes

- Embed the recurrence inside integrators that exploit sparsity patterns from
  the thermal or cosmological submodels to minimize memory traffic.
- Couple with energy-density or field-theory models to extend the quantum term
  \(f_q(\hbar, m, \Delta t)\) toward interaction-aware diffusion or tunneling
  corrections.
- Store logarithms of \(D_t\) when dynamic range is extreme to preserve numeric
  precision.
- Validate against analytic limits (e.g., \(a(t)=1\) reduces to pure diffusion)
  and monitor conserved invariants where applicable (entropy production,
  uncertainty bounds) to detect integration drift.
