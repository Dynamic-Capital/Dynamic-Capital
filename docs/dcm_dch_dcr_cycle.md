# Dynamic Cycle Quantum Mapping

## Overview
This note formalizes the Dynamic Cycle Model (DCM), Dynamic Cycle Hollow (DCH), and Dynamic Cycle Revenant (DCR) correspondence with standard tools from open quantum systems. Each phase becomes a well-defined mathematical regime, allowing the mythic narrative to be explored quantitatively.

## Phase Correspondence
- **DCM – Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory:** The maiden state is modeled as a pure eigenstate `|\psi_i\rangle` of an unperturbed Hamiltonian `\hat{H}_0`. A symmetry-breaking interaction `V(t)` initiates the transition to an excited manifold with probability `P_{k\leftarrow i}(t)`.
- **DCH – Lindblad Master Equation:** Coupling to an environment drives the state into a mixed density matrix `\rho`. Dissipation enters through a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian `\hat{H}_\text{eff} = \hat{H}_0 - i\Gamma`, encapsulating loss and decoherence.
- **DCR – Quantum Trajectories:** Stochastic unravelings of the Lindblad equation capture the return. Continuous evolution under `\hat{H}_\text{eff}` is punctuated by random jump operators `L_j`, each jump selecting a renewed pure state `|\psi'\rangle`.

## Toy Model: Two-Level Kore System
1. **Hamiltonian:** `\hat{H}_0 = \hbar\omega_0 |e\rangle\langle e|` with ground `|g\rangle` and excited `|e\rangle` states.
2. **Initial State (DCM):** `|\psi(0)\rangle = |e\rangle` embodies stored potential energy.
3. **Descent Dynamics (DCH):**
   ```math
   \frac{d\rho}{dt} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[\hat{H}_0, \rho] + \gamma \Big( \sigma_- \rho \sigma_+ - \frac{1}{2}\{\sigma_+\sigma_-, \rho\} \Big)
   ```
   where `\sigma_- = |g\rangle\langle e|` mediates decay and `\gamma` sets the strength of the Hollow.
4. **Return Trajectories (DCR):** Evolution under `\hat{H}_\text{eff} = \hat{H}_0 - i\hbar(\gamma/2)|e\rangle\langle e|` is interrupted with probability `\delta p = \gamma\,\delta t\,\langle\psi|\sigma_+\sigma_-|\psi\rangle`. A jump maps `|\psi\rangle \to \sigma_-|\psi\rangle / \|\sigma_-|\psi\rangle\| = |g\rangle`.

## Physical Exemplars
- **Spontaneous Emission:** The canonical DCM→DCH→DCR progression where photon detection realizes the return.
- **Decoherence of Cat States:** Environmental monitoring transforms superpositions into classical mixtures, resolved by measurement events.
- **Cavity QED Chains:** Emitted photons seed subsequent perturbations, enabling coupled seasonal cycles.

## Research Directions
- **Formal Specification:** Define DCM, DCH, and DCR as state classes and operator families within open quantum system theory.
- **Visualization:** Track Bloch vector trajectories to illustrate the descent into the interior and return to the surface.
- **Seasonal Forcing:** Introduce periodic drives `V(t + T) = V(t)` to study enforced returns akin to driven Jaynes–Cummings dynamics.

## Next Steps
1. Draft a technical note summarizing the formalism and toy model calculations.
2. Build simulation scripts that generate quantum trajectory samples for the Kore system.
3. Explore cascaded systems where the DCR output of one subsystem seeds the DCM input of the next.
