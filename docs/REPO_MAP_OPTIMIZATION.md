# Repository Map & Optimization Plan

_Last updated: 2025-09-17._

## 1. Repository Map

### 1.1 Application & Client Surfaces
| Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/web/` | Primary Next.js app | Hosts the marketing landing experience under `app/(marketing)` and the authenticated console under `app/telegram`, with shared UI primitives in `components/` and context providers in `context/`. |
| `apps/landing/` | Static snapshot helper | Bootstraps a headless capture of the Next.js homepage for the CDN-exported `_static/` bundle, mirroring Once UI components to guarantee parity between SSR and static delivery. |
| `_static/` & `server.js` | CDN-friendly export | Contains the frozen landing snapshot that the hardened Node server serves with cache control, CORS, and `/healthz` for probes. |
| `public/` assets | Shared collateral | Marketing, favicon, and mini-app assets consumed by both the dynamic Next.js runtime and the static snapshot. |

### 1.2 Automation & Services
| Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `supabase/functions/` | Edge function fleet | Deno functions spanning Telegram bot orchestration, private fund flows (`private-pool-*`), payments, analytics, webhook keepers, and AI helpers (`ai-faq-assistant`, `trade-helper`). Shared utilities live in `_shared/` for logging, validation, and secret handling. |
| `broadcast/` | Campaign scheduler | Schedules outbound broadcasts and promotional pushes, complementing Supabase cron triggers. |
| `queue/` | Worker harness | Processes queued background jobs (receipt OCR, payment reconciliation) outside the real-time Telegram event loop. |
| `go-service/` | Health shim | Minimal Go service offering `/healthz` to support uptime monitors and external load balancers. |

### 1.3 Data & Infrastructure
| Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `supabase/migrations/` | Database change log | Sequential SQL migrations covering schema, policies, and seed data for bots, payments, promos, analytics, and the private pool. |
| `db/` | Client utilities | TypeScript client bindings and schema helpers for accessing Supabase/Postgres resources from non-edge runtimes. |
| `docker/` | Container orchestration | Dockerfiles, Compose definitions, and Nginx reverse proxy config for replicable local or staging environments. |
| `dns/` | External records | DigitalOcean zone exports and JSON automation descriptors for infrastructure-as-code around DNS. |

### 1.4 Tooling, Quality & Knowledge Base
| Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripts/` | Operational scripts | CLI helpers for setting Telegram webhooks, syncing secrets, refreshing the landing snapshot, and running audits. |
| `tests/` | Automated validation | Vitest/Jest suites covering API routes, Supabase policies, Telegram flows, and helper utilities to prevent regressions. |
| `docs/` | Enablement hub | Comprehensive documentation set: deployment runbooks, compliance evidence, phased launch plans, inventories (`REPO_SUMMARY.md`, `INVENTORY.csv`), and environment references. |
| `tools/` | Developer aids | Generators and CLIs (e.g., AlgoKit scaffolding) that bootstrap new functions and enforce conventions. |

### 1.5 Site Map (Next.js & Supporting Endpoints)
| Route | Audience / Access | Description & Key Hooks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Public | Marketing landing experience rendered via the `OnceLandingPage` composition with CTA handlers deep-linking to the Telegram bot for onboarding, plan selection, and payments. |
| `/:locale` | Public | Locale-aware alias that reuses the homepage component and layout providers while injecting locale content, keeping routing logic centralized. |
| `/telegram` | Authenticated ops staff | Rich dashboard for monitoring the Telegram bot, reviewing analytics, managing promos, and launching the embedded admin console. |
| `/signal` | Public CDN | Serves the pre-rendered `_static/index.html` snapshot to host the marketing page without requiring runtime secrets. |
| `/healthz` | Ops & monitoring | JSON health probe exposing status, timestamp, and environment metadata for uptime checks. |
| `/api` | Programmatic | Baseline API heartbeat returning a simple payload with CORS headers for service-level probes. |
| `/api/hello` | Programmatic | Demo JSON response plus preflight handler for smoke tests and sample integrations. |
| `/api/auth/*` | Authenticated | NextAuth handler wired to the Supabase adapter and GitHub OAuth for secure console sign-in. |

### 1.6 Page Map (Landing `/` Experience)
1. **Hero & Primary CTAs** – Animated headline, value proposition, KPI stats, and dual CTAs (“Join the VIP desk”, “Explore how it works”) wired into Telegram deep links passed from the page shell.
2. **Why Dynamic Capital Section** – Three-card feature grid highlighting bank verification, crypto routing, and the admin cockpit, each with iconography and motion variants to reinforce differentiators.
3. **Plan Selector & Payment Guides** – Split layout pairing plan explainer copy with quick-start buttons for bank/crypto flows and pricing cards featuring benefits plus “Choose plan” actions.
4. **Workflow Timeline** – Four-step progression from proof submission to funds release, emphasizing automation metrics per phase.
5. **Social Proof & Final CTA** – Testimonials grid with roles/metrics culminating in closing CTAs that launch the Telegram workspace or reach support.
6. **Chat Assistant Widget** – Floating assistant managing open/minimized state, persisting message history, logging to Supabase, and offering fallbacks when AI responses fail.

### 1.7 App Map (Telegram Operations Console)
- **ChatAssistantWidget** – Client-side widget that persists message history, invokes the `ai-faq-assistant` edge function, logs interactions to Supabase, and supplies resilient fallbacks when the AI service is unavailable.
- **BotDashboard (`/telegram`)**
  - **Data bootstrap** – On mount, fetches analytics via `supabase.functions.invoke('analytics-data')` and pings `test-bot-status` to drive status badges and stats cards.
  - **Welcome view** – Hero header, four key stats, navigation cards (packages, support, config, analytics, promos, notifications, admin), and quick actions for launching the admin panel, refreshing status, and managing users.
  - **Detail views** – Conditional renders unlock specialized panels:
    - Configuration placeholder guiding admins back to the main dashboard.
    - Subscription management with editable plan cards.
    - Revenue analytics with summary tiles, package performance breakdown, chart placeholder, and export actions.
    - Support operations showing ticket metrics and recent requests.
    - Promo manager listing active campaigns with CRUD affordances, performance metrics, and clipboard copy for promo codes.
    - Admin view embedding the full `AdminDashboard` component for elevated controls.
- **AdminDashboard Component**
  - **Access control & data loading** – Verifies admin rights via Telegram IDs or Supabase profile roles, then calls edge functions for analytics and pending payments while listening for auth changes to refresh data.
  - **Loading/denied states** – Provides guarded UI with animated loader or access-denied messaging as checks resolve.
  - **Operational cockpit** – Once authorized, renders an Once UI–styled shell with overview metrics, last-sync badges, and tabbed navigation for payments, logs, bans, broadcast manager, and bot diagnostics, including inline approve/reject actions on queued payments.

### 1.8 App Router Route Inventory
Staying future proof means keeping an explicit contract for each App Router entry point so new routes can be added without breaking assumptions. The tables below cover UI surfaces (`page.tsx`) and server handlers (`route.ts`), including the data dependencies that must be honored when scaling features.

#### 1.8.1 UI Page Segments (`page.tsx`)
| Route | File | Description | Data & Service Dependencies | Scalability Guardrails |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `apps/web/app/page.tsx` | Renders the Once Landing Page shell plus the Chat Assistant widget to funnel visitors into Telegram. | Client-side handlers trigger `window.open` deep links; `ChatAssistantWidget` depends on Supabase Edge (`ai-faq-assistant`) and local storage for history persistence. | Keep CTA handlers abstracted behind props so new flows (e.g., waitlists) swap in without editing Once UI. If the widget grows, lazy-load it with `next/dynamic` to protect Core Web Vitals. |
| `/:locale` | `apps/web/app/[locale]/page.tsx` | Locale-aware alias that re-exports the root page to share layout and logic. | Relies on shared translation content loaded higher in the tree (planned `generateStaticParams`) and whichever copy management pipeline feeds the marketing team. | Introduce localized metadata via `generateMetadata` and drive translations through a CMS or JSON bundle per locale; keep re-export pattern to avoid drift between languages. |
| `/telegram` | `apps/web/app/telegram/page.tsx` | Authenticated dashboard entry that mounts `BotDashboard`. | Consumes Supabase Edge functions (`analytics-data`, `test-bot-status`) via React Query, plus session context from `Providers`. | Split panels into feature modules (`components/telegram/*`) as they grow, and gate new admin features behind feature flags stored in Supabase for controlled rollout. |
| `*` (404 fallback) | `apps/web/app/not-found.tsx` | Friendly not-found boundary with CTA back to the homepage. | Depends on the global layout and theme providers. | Keep copy short and avoid hardcoded product names so the view stays valid as branding evolves; consider wiring telemetry for missing routes to Supabase logs. |
| Error boundaries | `apps/web/app/error.tsx`, `apps/web/app/global-error.tsx` | Client-rendered error shells for route-level and root-level failures. | Receive error objects from Next.js runtime and render minimal HTML. | When adding async server components, ensure thrown errors remain serializable; hook observability (Sentry/Logflare) via a shared error reporter imported in these files. |

> **Future Locale Support** – When adding new locales, pair `apps/web/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` with a localized metadata exporter and share translational resources through a dedicated `/i18n` module to keep the route tree maintainable.

#### 1.8.2 Server & Edge Route Handlers (`route.ts`)
| Route | File | Methods | Description | Downstream Contracts | Scalability Guardrails |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/signal` | `apps/web/app/signal/route.ts` | `GET` | Streams the pre-rendered `_static/index.html` snapshot for the CDN marketing host. | Reads from `_static/index.html`; expects `npm run build:landing` to refresh the artifact before deploy. | If the snapshot grows, switch to async `fs.promises.readFile` and enable caching headers. Consider S3-backed storage when multiple regions need the artifact. |
| `/healthz` | `apps/web/app/healthz/route.ts` | `GET` | Health probe returning status, timestamp, and environment. | Uses `NODE_ENV` config helper; consumed by load balancers and uptime monitors. | Expand payload via shared `health-report` util so future services (Queue, Edge functions) append checks consistently. Keep handler synchronous for low latency. |
| `/api` | `apps/web/app/api/route.ts` | `GET`, `OPTIONS` | Baseline heartbeat with CORS preflight helper. | Depends on `@/utils/http.ts` helpers for JSON responses and method guards. | Reuse the helper when adding new verbs; co-locate integration tests under `tests/api/` to detect contract drift as more services consume the endpoint. |
| `/api/hello` | `apps/web/app/api/hello/route.ts` | `GET`, `OPTIONS` | Demo endpoint mirroring the baseline API response pattern. | Shares the HTTP utility helpers and is safe for public demos or smoke tests. | Convert to a template when scaffolding new endpoints—copy the method guards, update the payload, then add load tests before opening to partners. |
| `/api/auth/*` | `apps/web/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` | `GET`, `POST` | NextAuth handler using the Supabase adapter and GitHub OAuth for console sign-in. | Requires `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `GITHUB_ID`, `GITHUB_SECRET` environment variables and the shared `Providers` context for session hydration. | Externalize provider config into `config/auth.ts` when adding more identity providers, and backfill integration tests for sign-in/sign-out flows. |

### 1.9 Route Evolution & Scalability Guidelines
- **Establish scaffolding commands.** Add `npm run generate:route -- --name <segment>` (or a Plop generator) so every new route includes testing stubs, telemetry hooks, and documentation updates.
- **Co-locate observability.** Standardize on a lightweight `logRouteRequest` helper imported by new `route.ts` files to push metrics into Supabase or Logflare. This keeps monitoring coverage consistent as the API surface grows.
- **Guard dynamic imports.** When a route adds heavy client components (charts, editors), wrap them in `next/dynamic` with SSR disabled and provide skeleton fallbacks so the landing experience stays fast on marketing CDNs.
- **Document contracts first.** Before merging a new route, append it to the tables above, describe data dependencies, and link to relevant edge functions or migrations to avoid orphaned features.
- **Version operational APIs.** For programmatic consumers, adopt `/api/v1/*` namespacing as soon as the second integration appears. Use the existing `/api` heartbeat as the canonical place to publish supported versions.
- **Automate regression coverage.** Pair any new `page.tsx` or `route.ts` with Vitest/Playwright smoke tests (mirroring Section 3’s checklist) so rollback safety grows alongside the route map.
