# Test Run Log

## 2025-10-06

- Attempted to rerun the TON allocator and Supabase Deno suites; the execution
  halted when the npm CDN returned `502` responses while caching dependencies
  such as `bnc-sdk@4.6.9` and `@grammyjs/conversations@2.1.0`. See
  `docs/test-run-2025-10-06.md` for the failure log and follow-up actions.

## 2025-10-02

- Ran `npm run test` to validate the workspace after refreshing dependencies.
