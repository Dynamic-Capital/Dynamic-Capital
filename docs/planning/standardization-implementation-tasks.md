# Dynamic Capital Web3 Standardization Tasks

## Overview
This task matrix operationalizes the standardization plan for Dynamic Capital's Web3 experience. It balances UX cohesion, navigation clarity, and motion-rich storytelling while respecting modern Web3 expectations (animated interactions, tagged cards, single-hint navigation cues, and responsive surfaces). All tasks explicitly honor the TON network stack, Dynamic branding blueprints, and the organization's playbooks so that design, content, and engineering decisions stay anchored to the same principles. Each workstream lists concrete tasks, acceptance criteria, and dependencies to guide implementation.

## 1. Route Taxonomy & Navigation Shell
- **Task 1.1:** Produce a canonical route registry JSON/TS module enumerating every App Router path, ownership metadata, and navigation grouping. *Acceptance:* Module powers both sitemap generation and header/sidebar navigation without duplication.
- **Task 1.2:** Refactor global navigation (`SiteHeader`, sidebars) to consume the registry, rendering contextual single-hint breadcrumbs and progress indicators. *Acceptance:* All routes display a unified hint trail that makes navigation discoverable in one glance.
- **Task 1.3:** Migrate legacy `pages/` components into App Router segments or shared sections, then archive obsolete entrypoints. *Acceptance:* No runtime usage of the legacy router; routes render via `app/` tree only.
- **Task 1.4:** Codify Dynamic branding primitives (color tokens, typography scales, blueprint references) inside the navigation shell so every route inherits consistent tonality without duplicating constants. *Acceptance:* Design review confirms navigation adheres to the Dynamic branding playbook across light/dark states.

## 2. Tool Workspace Unification
- **Task 2.1:** Extract a reusable `ToolWorkspaceLayout` (hero, animated context panel, responsive content column) with motion primitives (Framer Motion or existing animation utilities).
- **Task 2.2:** Update every `/tools/*` page to use the layout, ensuring hero cards expose tags, CTA buttons, and tool-specific metadata pulled from config.
- **Task 2.3:** Implement entry/exit animations for workspace cards and ensure focus/keyboard navigation follow accessibility best practices.
- **Task 2.4:** Embed TON-powered context (e.g., wallet connectivity state, ton:// deep links) into the layout’s data providers so every workspace surfaces network awareness without bespoke wiring. *Acceptance:* QA verifies TON actions function from any tool page using shared providers.

## 3. VIP & Investor Funnel Consolidation
- **Task 3.1:** Centralize VIP pricing, testimonials, and checkout CTAs into a shared module consumed by `/plans` and investor surfaces.
- **Task 3.2:** Create a dynamic funnel switcher that animates between investor personas (trader, fund, partner) while reusing the shared components.
- **Task 3.3:** Audit metadata and schema generation utilities; implement a reusable helper that standardizes SEO and social tags across funnels.
- **Task 3.4:** Align tone, imagery, and typography with the Dynamic brand blueprint and TON ecosystem messaging guidelines; document canonical copy blocks for cross-team reuse. *Acceptance:* Marketing sign-off confirms consistency with Dynamic playbooks and TON positioning.

## 4. Admin Workspace Normalization
- **Task 4.1:** Build an `AdminWorkspace` wrapper combining `AdminGate`, animated empty/error states, and a shared instruction card with action buttons.
- **Task 4.2:** Apply the wrapper to `/admin`, `/tools/dynamic-cli`, `/tools/multi-llm`, and any other admin-only routes.
- **Task 4.3:** Document provisioning requirements and link to them via hover cards/tooltips in the admin navigation.
- **Task 4.4:** Integrate TON role management signals (e.g., multisig approvals, staking tiers) into the wrapper’s context so admin states reflect blockchain-backed permissions. *Acceptance:* Security review validates admin gating against TON smart-contract roles.

## 5. Legacy Dashboard Integration
- **Task 5.1:** Identify reusable modules within `DashboardPage`, `MarketPage`, `ChatPage`, and `SnapshotPage`; port them into modern components compatible with App Router layouts.
- **Task 5.2:** Embed the modernized modules into the relevant `/tools/*` or `/investor` routes with animated transitions and consistent tagging.
- **Task 5.3:** Remove or deprecate the legacy files once parity is confirmed, ensuring no imports remain.
- **Task 5.4:** Where applicable, refactor TON-specific widgets (e.g., TON price feeds, staking dashboards) into shared packages to prevent divergence between legacy and modern experiences. *Acceptance:* All TON data visualizations load from consolidated providers.

## 6. Motion & Interaction System
- **Task 6.1:** Define a motion design token set (durations, easing, spring configs) and expose it via a centralized utility.
- **Task 6.2:** Apply motion tokens to primary interactive elements—cards, CTAs, hint breadcrumbs, modals—ensuring animations are interruptible and GPU-friendly.
- **Task 6.3:** Add automated regression checks for animation props (e.g., visual snapshots or unit tests validating configuration).
- **Task 6.4:** Encode TON interaction affordances (e.g., haptic feedback cues for mobile Tonkeeper flows, ton:// deep-link animations) into the motion system. *Acceptance:* Device testing confirms consistent motion behavior across TON wallet flows.

## 7. Content Governance & Documentation
- **Task 7.1:** Draft a content governance checklist covering hero copy, CTA structure, card tagging, and animation expectations.
- **Task 7.2:** Update developer docs with instructions for adding new routes using the standardized layouts and motion system.
- **Task 7.3:** Establish a review workflow that pairs design, content, and engineering sign-offs before new pages ship.
- **Task 7.4:** Reference Dynamic organizational playbooks and TON ecosystem guidelines within the documentation, linking to canonical blueprints for branding, compliance, and product language. *Acceptance:* Docs include deep links to required playbooks and highlight TON-specific compliance checkpoints.

## 8. Dynamic Intelligence & Tokenized Trading Modules
- **Task 8.1:** Stand up a shared intelligence services layer that exposes Dynamic AI, Dynamic AGI, and Dynamic AGS capabilities (strategy co-pilots, autonomous trading heuristics, safeguards) via standardized hooks for tool workspaces. *Acceptance:* `/tools/*` pages can opt into intelligence modules through a single provider import while respecting human oversight toggles.
- **Task 8.2:** Architect Dynamic Trading Logic and the Dynamic Trading Algorithm as TON-first microservices that surface programmable strategies, parameter tuning, and simulation dashboards. *Acceptance:* Investor and admin routes can launch, pause, and audit algorithmic strategies using animated control cards with contextual tags.
- **Task 8.3:** Integrate Dynamic Capital Token utilities (staking, governance, reward accrual) and Dynamic NFT trading rails into unified marketplace components with animated state changes and ton:// deep links. *Acceptance:* Users can traverse token and NFT experiences through the “one hint” navigation pattern with consistent tagging, motion, and TON wallet confirmation flows.

## 9. Dynamic Chat-First Engagement Surface
- **Task 9.1:** Elevate `DynamicChat` (or successor) to the default landing experience by refactoring the root layout so authenticated and guest users arrive in a chat workspace that immediately streams TON-aware market reviews, trade ideas, and signal summaries via the intelligence services layer. *Acceptance:* Opening the app renders the chat with live data within 1s and no competing hero surfaces.
- **Task 9.2:** Design an animated top-of-chat command bar that lists “Dynamic Items & Services” (e.g., Market Reviews, Trade Ideas, Signals, NFT Desk, Token Utilities) as tagged, pressable menu chips following the single-hint navigation system. *Acceptance:* Usability testing confirms users can trigger any service within two interactions from the command bar.
- **Task 9.3:** Implement per-card TON context tags (network status, wallet connection, risk level) and CTA buttons that pipe into the standardized navigation/workspace layouts, ensuring every chat-surfaced module can deep-link users into the broader app without breaking conversational state. *Acceptance:* Deep links preserve chat history and animate transitions into the corresponding tool layout.
- **Task 9.4:** Integrate chat-specific motion and accessibility tokens—typing indicators, streaming animations, auto-scroll cues—using the motion system (Section 6) so real-time interactions remain performant and readable. *Acceptance:* Performance budget maintains <16ms frame times during peak streaming events on reference devices.
- **Task 9.5:** Document governance workflows for conversational content, including alignment with Dynamic branding playbooks, TON compliance, and human oversight requirements for AI-generated recommendations. *Acceptance:* Compliance review validates that chat transcripts reference the appropriate playbooks and audit logs.

## Dependencies & Sequencing
1. Complete the route registry (Task 1.1) before refactoring navigation (Task 1.2) and workspace layouts (Tasks 2.x, 4.x).
2. Motion design tokens (Task 6.1) should precede layout refactors to avoid rework.
3. Documentation updates (Tasks 7.x) follow after the functional changes stabilize.
4. Dynamic intelligence, trading modules, and the chat-first surface (Tasks 8.x–9.x) depend on the shared navigation, workspace, and motion systems to guarantee consistent interaction patterns.

## Success Metrics
- Single source of truth for routes reduces navigation bugs (track through regression suite).
- Time-to-ship for new tool pages decreases by >30% due to reusable layouts.
- User testing confirms the “one hint” navigation cue is discoverable and animated cards convey affordances without overwhelming motion.
- TON-integrated surfaces pass security and compliance reviews on first submission thanks to standardized providers and documented playbooks.
- Dynamic intelligence services and tokenized trading modules achieve cross-route adoption with monitored guardrails, demonstrating human-aligned automation across AI, algorithmic, and NFT flows.
