# Dynamic UI/UX Remediation Plan

> **Status:** Proposed roadmap to eliminate UI regressions across domains and builds while uplifting end-to-end Dynamic UX quality.

## Objectives

- Restore consistent, defect-free UI behavior across Dynamic Capital domains (web, mobile, partner portals, internal consoles).
- Establish a resilient release workflow that prevents UI regressions across staging, canary, and production builds.
- Elevate Dynamic UX maturity through data-driven design enhancements aligned with the Dynamic Design System.

## Scope Overview

| Surface | Domains / Repos | Key Concerns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public web + landing | `apps/web`, `apps/landing` | Navigation inconsistencies, responsiveness gaps, brand drift. |
| Authenticated workspaces | `apps/web`, `apps/dashboard` (if applicable), `dynamic_*` micro-apps | Widget state mismatches, data latency handling, accessibility. |
| Mobile + mini-apps | TON Mini Apps, React Native shells | Layout breakpoints, gesture affordances, store approval regressions. |
| Internal tooling | `dynamic_admin`, `dynamic_task_manager`, analytics dashboards | Form validation drift, low test coverage, theming inconsistency. |
| Shared packages | `dynamic_design_system`, `dynamic_components`, storybook packages | Token drift, component variants, documentation gaps. |

## Current Pain Points & Diagnostics

1. **Fragmented design tokens** causing inconsistent typography, spacing, and color usage across builds.
2. **Insufficient automated regression coverage** for critical user journeys (auth, funding, trading flows).
3. **Asynchronous data race conditions** leading to flicker or stale data on dashboards during build switches.
4. **Environment-specific feature flags** not synchronized, yielding divergent behavior between staging and prod.
5. **Lack of centralized UX telemetry** to quantify task success, drop-off, and accessibility conformance.

## Workstreams

### 1. Design System Harmonization
- Inventory current tokens, components, and variants across packages using a snapshot script.
- Normalize tokens into a single source (`dynamic_design_system/tokens.json`) and propagate via codemods.
- Expand Storybook coverage with accessibility notes, responsive stories, and visual regression baselines.
- Stand up a shared Figma library synced with repo tokens to minimize drift between design and code.
- Deliverable: Signed-off vNext Design System spec with changelog, adoption checklist, and published migration playbook.

### 2. Build & Release Stabilization
- Map CI/CD per domain (Vercel, Expo EAS, Docker pipelines) and align on unified promotion gates.
- Introduce contract tests for shared GraphQL/REST schemas using `npm run typecheck:contracts` (new script).
- Enforce visual regression suites (Chromatic/Playwright) in pre-merge; publish diff reports to Slack and release dashboard.
- Establish environment parity scripts that validate feature flag, config, and locale bundles before promotion.
- Deliverable: Hardened release checklist, automated gate status dashboard, and published rollback/runbook decision tree.

### 3. Domain Remediation Pods
- Form cross-functional pods per domain (Public Web, Trading Workspace, Internal Ops, Mobile) with PM/Design/Eng QA.
- Run 2-week triage sprints: backlog UI bugs, categorize (Severity, Frequency, Revenue Impact), and assign fixes.
- Embed UX writing review for high-impact surfaces (onboarding, trade confirmation, support flows).
- Publish pod scorecards each sprint capturing burn-down velocity, satisfaction deltas, and escaped defect counts.
- Deliverable: Cleared Sev0/Sev1 backlog, domain-specific UX enhancement log, and forward-looking maintenance SLAs.

### 4. Dynamic UX Elevation
- Conduct heuristic evaluation + task-based usability sessions with representative personas.
- Implement instrumentation (Product Analytics, FullStory-like session replay with privacy filters).
- Launch A/B or multi-armed tests for key flows (signup funnel, funding conversion, trading widgets) guided by hypotheses.
- Build a UX experiment registry linking hypotheses to KPI impact and follow-on backlog actions.
- Deliverable: UX Experimentation backlog with prioritized roadmap, signed-off learnings, and KPI improvement targets.

### 5. Accessibility & Compliance
- Baseline WCAG 2.2 AA conformance with automated tools (axe-core) + manual audits.
- Remediate critical issues (keyboard traps, contrast, semantic structure) across shared components first.
- Integrate accessibility CI step and require VPAT updates for enterprise commitments.
- Pair remediation with developer enablement (checklists, lint rules, training) to prevent regression debt.
- Deliverable: Accessibility conformance report, updated accessibility statement, and recurring compliance calendar.

### 6. Experience Resilience & Support
- Stand up live incident triage channels with standard operating procedures for UI regressions.
- Deploy in-product feedback widgets to capture user sentiment at point-of-friction.
- Feed insights into weekly “Dynamic UX Council” reviews that decide on roadmap pivots or additional safeguards.
- Deliverable: Closed-loop defect/feedback workflow with measured mean time-to-detect (MTTD) and mean time-to-resolve (MTTR).

## Build Matrix & Environment Parity Checklist

1. **Matrix Coverage:** Track artifacts for `dev`, `staging`, `canary`, `production` across web, mobile, and mini-app builds.
2. **Feature Flags:** Maintain YAML manifest in repo describing flag defaults per environment; sync nightly.
3. **Data Contracts:** Run contract tests before promoting builds; block promotion on schema drift.
4. **Smoke Tests:** Execute cross-environment smoke suite post-deploy with automated rollback triggers.
5. **Parity Reporting:** Publish weekly parity status (pass/fail + owner) to steering committee dashboard.

## UX Improvement Pipeline

1. Define UX OKRs aligned to revenue and satisfaction goals.
2. Prioritize hypotheses in the experiment registry based on impact/effort and risk profile.
3. Ensure telemetry hooks are validated before launch; capture qualitative insights from user testing.
4. Feed insights into the product roadmap and backlog grooming sessions each sprint.
5. Close the loop by reporting KPI movement and backlog adjustments during steering reviews.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Circulate the Phase 0 checklist to steering members for sign-off and assign Asana/Jira tasks with linked owners.
2. Draft the communication memo and create shared Slack channels (`#ui-remediation`, `#ux-telemetry`) to support the cadence table above.
3. Schedule Chromatic and Playwright proof-of-concept sessions in Week 2 to validate tooling decisions before wider rollout.
4. Prepare the baseline telemetry snapshot (incidents, Core Web Vitals, NPS) prior to the first steering review to anchor KPI tracking.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Approve steering committee charter and assign domain pod leads.
2. Kick off Phase 0 discovery workshops to validate inventory and capture domain-specific blockers.
3. Spin up centralized dashboard tracking bug burn-down, experiment status, and KPI trends.
4. Schedule Phase 1 implementation start date with aligned resource plan.
5. Publish first environment parity report and confirm telemetry instrumentation scope before Phase 1 starts.
