# Dynamic UI/UX Remediation Plan

> **Status:** Proposed roadmap to eliminate UI regressions across domains and builds while uplifting end-to-end Dynamic UX quality.

## Objectives

- Restore consistent, defect-free UI behavior across Dynamic Capital domains (web, mobile, partner portals, internal consoles).
- Establish a resilient release workflow that prevents UI regressions across staging, canary, and production builds.
- Elevate Dynamic UX maturity through data-driven design enhancements aligned with the Dynamic Design System.

## Scope Overview

| Surface | Domains / Repos | Key Concerns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public web + landing | `apps/web`, `apps/landing` | Navigation inconsistencies, responsiveness gaps, brand drift. |
| Authenticated workspaces | `apps/web`, `apps/dashboard` (if applicable), `dynamic_*` micro-apps | Widget state mismatches, data latency handling, accessibility. |
| Mobile + mini-apps | TON Mini Apps, React Native shells | Layout breakpoints, gesture affordances, store approval regressions. |
| Internal tooling | `dynamic_admin`, `dynamic_task_manager`, analytics dashboards | Form validation drift, low test coverage, theming inconsistency. |
| Shared packages | `dynamic_design_system`, `dynamic_components`, storybook packages | Token drift, component variants, documentation gaps. |

## Current Pain Points & Diagnostics

1. **Fragmented design tokens** causing inconsistent typography, spacing, and color usage across builds.
2. **Insufficient automated regression coverage** for critical user journeys (auth, funding, trading flows).
3. **Asynchronous data race conditions** leading to flicker or stale data on dashboards during build switches.
4. **Environment-specific feature flags** not synchronized, yielding divergent behavior between staging and prod.
5. **Lack of centralized UX telemetry** to quantify task success, drop-off, and accessibility conformance.

## Workstreams

### 1. Design System Harmonization
- Inventory current tokens, components, and variants across packages using a snapshot script.
- Normalize tokens into a single source (`dynamic_design_system/tokens.json`) and propagate via codemods.
- Expand Storybook coverage with accessibility notes, responsive stories, and visual regression baselines.
- Deliverable: Signed-off vNext Design System spec with changelog and adoption guidelines.

### 2. Build & Release Stabilization
- Map CI/CD per domain (Vercel, Expo EAS, Docker pipelines) and align on unified promotion gates.
- Introduce contract tests for shared GraphQL/REST schemas using `npm run typecheck:contracts` (new script).
- Enforce visual regression suites (Chromatic/Playwright) in pre-merge; publish diff reports to Slack.
- Deliverable: Hardened release checklist and automated gate status dashboard.

### 3. Domain Remediation Pods
- Form cross-functional pods per domain (Public Web, Trading Workspace, Internal Ops, Mobile) with PM/Design/Eng QA.
- Run 2-week triage sprints: backlog UI bugs, categorize (Severity, Frequency, Revenue Impact), and assign fixes.
- Embed UX writing review for high-impact surfaces (onboarding, trade confirmation, support flows).
- Deliverable: Cleared Sev0/Sev1 backlog and documented UX enhancements per domain.

### 4. Dynamic UX Elevation
- Conduct heuristic evaluation + task-based usability sessions with representative personas.
- Implement instrumentation (Product Analytics, FullStory-like session replay with privacy filters).
- Launch A/B or multi-armed tests for key flows (signup funnel, funding conversion, trading widgets) guided by hypotheses.
- Deliverable: UX Experimentation backlog with prioritized roadmap and success metrics.

### 5. Accessibility & Compliance
- Baseline WCAG 2.2 AA conformance with automated tools (axe-core) + manual audits.
- Remediate critical issues (keyboard traps, contrast, semantic structure) across shared components first.
- Integrate accessibility CI step and require VPAT updates for enterprise commitments.
- Deliverable: Accessibility conformance report and updated accessibility statement.

## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Exit Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0: Mobilize | 1 week | Staffing, scope validation, environment audit | Steering committee charter + current-state scorecard |
| Phase 1: Stabilize Foundations | 3 weeks | Token harmonization, CI/CD alignment, telemetry baselines | Unified tokens merged, gated pipelines live, UX telemetry MVP online |
| Phase 2: Domain Remediation | 6 weeks (parallel pods) | Bug backlog elimination, targeted UX uplift | Sev0/1 closed, NPS/task success improvements per domain |
| Phase 3: UX Elevation | 4 weeks | Experiments, accessibility, personalization | Experiment results logged, WCAG AA compliance achieved |
| Phase 4: Continuous Improvement | Ongoing | Governance, continuous QA, design review cadence | Quarterly UX health reviews, rolling OKRs tracked |

## Governance & Coordination

- **Steering Committee:** Head of Product, Design Lead, Platform Eng Manager, QA Lead. Bi-weekly reviews.
- **Pod Rituals:** Daily standup, twice-weekly design/QA sync, end-of-sprint demo + retro.
- **Documentation:** All artifacts stored in `docs/ui` with changelog entries; design tokens tracked via ADR.
- **Risk Register:** Maintained in `dynamic_task_manager`; reviewed each steering meeting.

## Operating Cadence & RACI

| Activity | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Token harmonization backlog | Design System Lead | Head of Design | Domain Pod Leads | Steering Committee |
| CI/CD gate automation | Platform Engineering | Platform Eng Manager | QA Automation, Security | All Pods |
| Domain remediation sprints | Pod Engineering Leads | Product Owners | UX Research, Customer Support | Steering Committee |
| Accessibility reviews | Accessibility Specialist | QA Lead | Legal, Compliance | Stakeholders & Support |
| Experiment roadmap refresh | Growth PM | Head of Product | Data Science, Design | Steering Committee |

## Quality Gates & Audits

- **Pre-merge controls:** Require passing `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, UI snapshot verification, and `npm run audit` for every domain pod PR.
- **Nightly automation:** Schedule nightly Playwright smoke suites, contract tests, and accessibility scans with alerts into #ui-quality.
- **Release readiness:** Gate deployments on zero Sev0/Sev1 bugs, fresh audit artifacts (dependencies, accessibility, performance), and stakeholder sign-off captured in `dynamic_task_manager`.
- **Post-release review:** Within 48 hours, review telemetry deltas (conversion, latency, error budgets) and retro key findings back into the remediation backlog.

## Tooling & Infrastructure Upgrades

| Need | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Visual regression | Adopt Chromatic or Playwright screenshot suite integrated into CI. |
| Performance monitoring | Expand Web Vitals + mobile Perfetto traces, set SLO thresholds. |
| Feature flag control | Standardize on LaunchDarkly (or internal equivalent) with environment parity rules. |
| Analytics | Implement Amplitude/Segment pipeline with anonymization to fuel UX experiments. |

## KPIs & Success Metrics

- **Reliability:** <1% UI blocker incidents per release; 95% automated test pass rate pre-deploy.
- **Consistency:** Token drift variance <5% across audited surfaces; 0 unresolved Sev1+ UI bugs per sprint.
- **UX Outcomes:** +10 pts task success in usability tests; +5 pts NPS for trading workspace; <2s P95 input-to-render latency.
- **Accessibility:** 0 critical WCAG violations; VPAT updated quarterly.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Scope Creep:** Anchor backlog to approved remediation list; enforce change control via steering committee.
- **Resource Constraints:** Leverage contractor pool or shift roadmap commitments; automate QA to reduce manual load.
- **Telemetry Gaps:** Prioritize instrumentation in Phase 1 to avoid blind spots; ensure privacy compliance reviews.
- **Toolchain Fragmentation:** Consolidate build tooling early, document runbooks, and provide enablement sessions.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Approve steering committee charter and assign domain pod leads.
2. Kick off Phase 0 discovery workshops to validate inventory and capture domain-specific blockers.
3. Spin up centralized dashboard tracking bug burn-down, experiment status, and KPI trends.
4. Schedule Phase 1 implementation start date with aligned resource plan.
