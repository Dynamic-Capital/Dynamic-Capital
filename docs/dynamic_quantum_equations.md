# Dynamic Quantum Equations in Cosmic Contexts

## 1. Quantum Fluctuations in the Early Universe

- **Scenario:** Inflationary epoch stretching from ~10^−36 to 10^−32 seconds
  after the Big Bang.
- **Governing equation:**
  ```math
  \\ddot{\phi} + 3H \\dot{\phi} - \frac{1}{a^2} \\nabla^2 \phi + V'(\phi) = 0
  ```
- **Key parameters:**
  - \(\phi\) — Inflaton scalar field.
  - \(H = \dot{a}/a\) — Hubble parameter.
  - \(a\) — Scale factor of the universe.
  - \(V'(\phi)\) — Derivative of the inflaton potential.
- **Cosmic impact:**
  - Vacuum fluctuations \(\delta \phi\) are stretched beyond the horizon,
    freezing as classical density perturbations.
  - The resulting power spectrum is approximately scale invariant:
    ```math
    P(k) \propto \left( \frac{H^2}{\dot{\phi}} \right)^2
    ```
  - Observations from COBE, WMAP, and Planck satellites align with these
    predictions, underpinning the formation of galaxies and clusters.

## 2. Black Holes and Hawking Radiation

- **Scenario:** Quantum pair production near event horizons causing black holes
  to radiate.
- **Temperature relation:**
  ```math
  T = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi G M k_B}
  ```
- **Interpretation:**
  - Particle–antiparticle pairs emerge via Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
    \(\Delta E \Delta t \geq \hbar/2\).
  - One particle falls behind the horizon while its partner escapes, leading to
    mass loss.
- **Cosmic impact:**
  - Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe could leave
    observable signatures as they evaporate.
  - Supermassive black holes evaporate extremely slowly but offer a rare bridge
    between general relativity and quantum mechanics.

## 3. Quantum Entanglement Across Cosmological Scales

- **Scenario:** Quantum correlations potentially linking distant spacetime
  regions.
- **Canonical entangled state:**
  ```math
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow \downarrow \rangle - | \downarrow \uparrow \rangle \right)
  ```
- **Key ideas:**
  - Measurement on one particle instantaneously correlates with the other,
    independent of separation.
  - The density matrix \(\rho = |\psi\rangle \langle\psi|\) encodes the
    correlations.
- **Cosmic impact:**
  - ER=EPR conjecture proposes that entangled pairs may be connected via
    non-traversable wormholes.
  - Such entanglement-driven geometry might explain the homogeneity of the
    universe or resolve aspects of black hole information.

## 4. Wheeler–DeWitt Equation and Quantum Cosmology

- **Master constraint:**
  ```math
  \hat{H} \\Psi[h_{ij}, \phi] = 0
  ```
- **Components:**
  - \(\\Psi\) — Wave function of the universe over three-metric configurations
    \(h_{ij}\) and matter fields \(\phi\).
  - \(\hat{H}\) — Hamiltonian constraint operator from canonical general
    relativity.
- **Cosmic impact:**
  - Encapsulates a "timeless" description of the universe, raising the problem
    of time in quantum gravity.
  - Enables models such as the Hartle–Hawking no-boundary proposal, eliminating
    the classical initial singularity.

## Example: Hydrogen Atom in Stellar Environments

- **Schrödinger equation with Coulomb potential:**
  ```math
  \left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} \nabla^2 - \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r} \right) \psi(r, \theta, \phi) = E \psi(r, \theta, \phi)
  ```
- **Ground state solution:**
  ```math
  \psi_{1s} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi a_0^3}} e^{-r/a_0}, \quad E_1 = -\frac{13.6\,\text{eV}}{n^2}, \quad n=1
  ```
- **Astrophysical relevance:**
  - Quantum tunneling enables fusion in stellar cores, overcoming Coulomb
    barriers.
  - Spectral lines corresponding to these energy levels inform stellar
    classifications and compositions through telescopes such as JWST.

## Why These Equations Matter

- **Early-universe physics:** Inflationary quantum fluctuations seed the cosmic
  microwave background anisotropies and large-scale structure.
- **Black hole thermodynamics:** Hawking radiation connects quantum field theory
  to gravity, offering probes of primordial conditions and dark matter
  hypotheses.
- **Quantum gravity insights:** Entanglement and the Wheeler–DeWitt equation
  motivate frameworks where spacetime geometry emerges from quantum information.
- **Stellar processes:** Atomic-scale quantum mechanics underpins fusion and
  spectra, anchoring observational cosmology to fundamental physics.

## Next Steps for Exploration

- Derive the scalar perturbation power spectrum and compare with Planck data
  releases.
- Model Hawking radiation spectra for varying PBH masses and assess
  observational constraints.
- Explore tensor networks or holographic models that formalize ER=EPR
  connections.
- Solve minisuperspace versions of the Wheeler–DeWitt equation to analyze
  quantum cosmological scenarios.
- Simulate stellar fusion rates incorporating updated quantum tunneling
  probabilities for different metallicities.
