# Vulnerability Audit â€” 6 Oct 2025

## Overview

This report summarizes repository-wide dependency vulnerability checks executed
on 6 Oct 2025 across the primary runtime environments (Node.js, Python, Go).
Each subsection lists the command that was run, its outcome, and any follow-up
actions required.

## Node.js Workspaces

### Root workspace (`package.json`)

- **Command:** `npm audit`
- **Result:** No vulnerabilities were reported.
- **Recommended action:** None required.

### `naming-engine`

- **Command:** `npm audit`
- **Result:** No vulnerabilities were reported.
- **Recommended action:** None required.

## Python Environments

### `ml/requirements.txt`

- **Command:** `pip-audit -r ml/requirements.txt -f json`
- **Result:** No known vulnerabilities reported for the pinned dependencies.
- **Recommended action:** None required.

### `dns/requirements-toncli.txt`

- **Command:** `pip-audit -r dns/requirements-toncli.txt -f json`
- **Result:** No known vulnerabilities reported for the TON CLI tooling
  dependencies.
- **Recommended action:** None required.

### `dynamic_crawlers/requirements-github.txt`

- **Command:** `pip-audit -r dynamic_crawlers/requirements-github.txt`
- **Result:** Audit completed with no vulnerabilities reported.
- **Recommended action:** None required.

### `grok-1/requirements.txt`

- **Command:** `pip-audit -r grok-1/requirements.txt`
- **Result:** No known vulnerabilities were reported after splitting the
  CUDA-specific `--find-links` directive onto its own line and adding a CPU
  fallback (`jax==0.4.25` for Python 3.12+) so `pip-audit` can resolve
  dependencies inside its isolated environment.
- **Recommended action:**
  - Keep the production GPU deployment on the supported Python toolchain
    (`<3.12`) so the CUDA wheel remains available.
  - If GPU acceleration is optional in CI, continue auditing against the CPU
    fallback to catch ecosystem advisories promptly.
  - Revisit the requirement markers when CUDA wheels for Python 3.12 become
    available so the audit environment matches production more closely.

## Go Services

### `go-service`

- **Command:** `govulncheck ./...`
- **Result:** Two vulnerabilities were flagged in the Go 1.24.3 standard library
  (`GO-2025-3750` affecting `syscall` on Windows and `GO-2025-3749` affecting
  `crypto/x509`). These advisories are fixed in Go 1.24.4.
- **Recommended action:** Upgrade the Go toolchain used to build `go-service` to
  at least Go 1.24.4 and rebuild the binary to pick up the patched standard
  library.

## Next Steps

- Track the Go toolchain upgrade in the platform backlog to ensure the
  identified standard library patches are applied promptly.
- For the `grok-1` CUDA dependency, coordinate with the ML team to determine the
  appropriate auditing workflow.
