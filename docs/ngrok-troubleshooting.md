# Ngrok HTTP Tunnel Troubleshooting

## Requested Command

The following command was requested but cannot run successfully in this environment because the `ngrok` CLI is not available:

```bash
ngrok http --url=exosporal-ezequiel-semibiographically.ngrok-free.dev 80
```

## Step-by-Step Resolution

1. **Install ngrok.**
   - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu).**

     ```bash
     curl -s https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null
     echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ngrok
     ngrok version
     ```

     These commands add the official apt repository, install the CLI, and confirm the binary is available.
   - **macOS.** Run `brew install ngrok` (or download the macOS binary from <https://ngrok.com/download>), then ensure `/usr/local/bin` is on your `PATH`.
   - **Windows.** Download and unzip the binary, then add the containing folder to the `Path` environment variable so `ngrok` is invocable from any terminal.
2. **Authenticate.** Run `ngrok config add-authtoken <token>` with a token from the ngrok dashboard to link the binary to your account. Confirm configuration with `ngrok config check`.
3. **Reserve or verify the custom domain.** From the ngrok dashboard go to **Domains** and ensure `exosporal-ezequiel-semibiographically.ngrok-free.dev` is reserved for your account. Note the endpoint identifier (`ep_33KMRY2qqYoDugxq8JEyLmOPSqM`) listed with the domain so you can confirm you're updating the correct resource. If not reserved, claim it before starting the tunnel.
4. **Start the tunnel.** Execute the requested command once the CLI is installed and authenticated. If you encounter an error about an unknown flag, upgrade to the latest ngrok v3 release (`ngrok update`) because the `--url` flag is only available in v3.

If you cannot install software on the current machine, run the command from a workstation that already has `ngrok` installed.

## Verify the Connection

Once the tunnel command is running on a supported machine:

1. **Check the tunnel status locally.** The ngrok console prints the assigned forwarding URLâ€”confirm it matches `https://exosporal-ezequiel-semibiographically.ngrok-free.dev`. You can also visit <http://127.0.0.1:4040/status> to confirm the tunnel is active.
2. **Test the endpoint.** From another terminal, use `curl https://exosporal-ezequiel-semibiographically.ngrok-free.dev` (or the appropriate path) to ensure you receive the expected response from your local service.
3. **Inspect the ngrok dashboard.** Visit <https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints/status> to confirm the tunnel is active and requests are flowing. The **Last Connection** timestamp should update when you send traffic, and the entry should display the endpoint ID `ep_33KMRY2qqYoDugxq8JEyLmOPSqM`.
4. **Review logs for errors.** In the terminal running ngrok press `Ctrl+L` (or open the **Logs** tab in the dashboard) to reveal connection attempts. Look for TLS handshake failures, 502 responses, or `ERR_NGROK_xxx` codes and resolve them based on the logged guidance.

If any of these verification steps fail, review the ngrok logs (displayed in the tunnel console) for connection errors and ensure the local service on port `80` is reachable. You can test the local service directly with `curl http://localhost:80` to make sure it is serving traffic before exposing it via ngrok.
