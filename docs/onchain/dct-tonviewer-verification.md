# Dynamic Capital Token Tonviewer Verification Runbook

## Purpose

Tonviewer continues to label the Dynamic Capital Token (DCT) jetton master as
**Contract type not verified** and Tonkeeper displays the jetton as
**Unverified** until the project provides a verification package. This runbook
summarizes the artefacts that must be shared with the Tonviewer review team and
tracks the submission workflow so the badge flips to **Verified** across Ton
explorers and
wallets.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/contracts/jetton/metadata.json†L1-L28】

## Required artefacts

| Item                              | Source                                                                                                                      | Notes                                                                    |

| FunC discoverable sources         | [`dynamic-capital-ton/contracts/jetton/discoverable/`](../../dynamic-capital-ton/contracts/jetton/discoverable/)            | Includes `master.fc` plus the import modules Tonviewer needs to compile. |
| Jetton metadata (`metadata.json`) | [`dynamic-capital-ton/contracts/jetton/metadata.json`](../../dynamic-capital-ton/contracts/jetton/metadata.json)            | Must be hosted at the URI embedded in the master contract content cell.  |
| Governance overview               | [`dynamic-capital-ton/contracts/README.md`](../../dynamic-capital-ton/contracts/README.md)                                  | Documents multisig ownership and timelock guarantees.                    |
| Verification bundle manifest      | Generated by [`apps/tools/generate-tonviewer-bundle.ts`](../../dynamic-capital-ton/apps/tools/generate-tonviewer-bundle.ts) | Includes metadata checksum and submission checklist.                     |

## Build the Tonviewer bundle

1. Ensure the Dynamic Capital repository is up to date and that `config.yaml`
   carries the canonical jetton master address and governance
   configuration.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/config.yaml†L1-L31】
2. Run the bundle script from the repo root so Deno can install and zip the
   assets:

   ```bash
   $(bash scripts/deno_bin.sh) run -A dynamic-capital-ton/apps/tools/generate-tonviewer-bundle.ts
   ```

3. The script stages the FunC sources, metadata, README, and an evidence
   manifest under `dynamic-capital-ton/build/tonviewer/` and emits
   `dct-tonviewer-verification.zip` ready for upload. The console output
   includes the metadata SHA-256 hash that Tonviewer will ask for during review.

## Submission workflow

1. **Upload the bundle** via the Tonviewer verification portal
   (`https://tonviewer.com/verification`). Attach the generated ZIP file and
   cite the jetton master address
   (`0:d29b3e11ac30451be4f58b3c1527bab576902ad662532eb2b0c8c6098a0e96c7`).
2. **Reference governance controls** by pointing reviewers to the timelock and
   multisig description inside the packaged `contracts/README.md`. Highlight the
   Governance addresses table (admin multisig, treasury, and router in friendly
   and raw formats) and mention that the metadata hash included in
   `manifest.json` matches the hosted JSON.
3. **Open a Tonkeeper asset ticket** (see
   [`docs/dct-tonkeeper-asset-verification.md`](../dct-tonkeeper-asset-verification.md))
   and include the same bundle so the wallet and explorer reviews stay in
   sync.【F:docs/dct-tonkeeper-asset-verification.md†L1-L110】
4. **Track responses** in the compliance register (ticket ID, submission date,
   reviewer). Escalate via email/Telegram if no acknowledgement arrives within
   two business days.
5. **Confirm publication** by refreshing Tonviewer and Tonkeeper once approval
   is granted. Capture before/after screenshots and file them alongside the
   bundle for audit readiness.
6. **Poll the Tonviewer status CLI** to confirm metadata parity and the
   verification flag:

   ```bash
   $(bash scripts/deno_bin.sh) run -A dynamic-capital-ton/apps/tools/check-tonviewer-status.ts
   ```

   The command fetches Tonapi's jetton view, compares it to the repository
   metadata, and surfaces mismatches that could delay the verification badge.

## Status tracker template

| Field              | Example                            | Notes                                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Submission date    | `2025-02-18`                       | Date Tonviewer received the ZIP bundle.               |
| Ticket / reference | `TVR-1042`                         | Tonviewer ticket ID or confirmation link.             |
| Reviewer           | `@tonviewer-support`               | Contact that acknowledged the request.                |
| Current status     | `Pending review`                   | States: Submitted → In review → Approved → Published. |
| Next follow-up     | `2025-02-20 (Telegram)`            | Date/channel for the next touchpoint.                 |
| Evidence location  | `compliance/tonviewer/dct-2025Q1/` | Folder containing bundle, hashes, and screenshots.    |

Maintaining this checklist alongside the generated bundle ensures repeatable
verifications and gives the compliance desk a single source of truth for the
Tonviewer status.
