# The Self-Improvement Equation

This note captures the intuition behind the cyclical improvement rule

$$
S_{t+1} = (S_t + A_t) \cdot (1 + R_t + L_t)
$$

where:

- $S_t$ represents the current state of the self.
- $A_t$ bundles the concrete actions chosen through a What + How framing.
- $R_t$ denotes reflective depth, the renewed Why + Who inquiry for the next
  loop.
- $L_t$ encodes the new learning extracted from Which + Where + When
  exploration.

## How the Update Works

1. **Identity-first expansion** – Begin each cycle by revisiting Why you are in
   the process and Who you are becoming. This keeps the identity anchor grounded
   before tactical choices are made.
2. **Action injection** – Integrate the best available What and How responses as
   the additive term $A_t$. These drive direct movement in the state without yet
   compounding the loop.
3. **Compounding reflection and learning** – Scale the state-plus-action bundle
   by $(1 + R_t + L_t)$. Reflection $R_t$ deepens alignment, while learning
   $L_t$ widens the possibility space through Which, Where, and When
   experimentation.

## Practical Interpretation

- **Identity → goals → execution sequencing** – Moving from internal anchors
  (Why, Who, What) to external logistics (Which, How, When, Where) ensures that
  each loop is coherent with long-term identity while still producing measurable
  outputs.
- **Compounding loops** – Reflection and learning act multiplicatively, so even
  modest gains in $R_t$ or $L_t$ compound prior progress. Skipping these phases
  collapses the loop back to incremental action without reinforcement.
- **Adaptive calibration** – Track $A_t$, $R_t$, and $L_t$ explicitly to
  diagnose whether progress stalls from insufficient action, shallow reflection,
  or weak learning inputs. Adjust the corresponding practice to restore
  momentum.
- **Deepening cycles** – Repeated passes through the loop should sharpen
  identity, refine goals, and accelerate progress. The model highlights how
  qualitative insights (reflection, learning) quantitatively amplify tangible
  actions.

Use the equation as a weekly or monthly retrospective tool: score each
component, estimate its impact on the next state, and plan interventions that
raise the multiplicative terms rather than chasing more actions alone.
