# Dynamic AGI Starter Stack

This document captures the baseline open-source stack that can power the Dynamic
AGI training pipeline while staying approachable for new contributors and end
users. The components below balance orchestration, reasoning, quantum
experimentation, and governance.

## 1. [LangChain — Orchestration Layer](https://www.langchain.com/)

- **Role:** Acts as the "nervous system" that chains models, memory, and tools.
- **Why it matters:** Normalizes incoming signals, manages conversational
  context, and routes queries between Dynamic Thought Logic (DTL) and Dynamic
  Task Automation (DTA).
- **Dynamic Capital use case:** Wrap TradingView alerts and MetaTrader 5 (MT5)
  logs into structured prompts before handing them to downstream reasoning
  agents.
- **Implementation steps:**
  1. Define LangChain `RunnableSequence` graphs for ingestion, reasoning, and
     post-processing; store manifests in version control with schema contracts.
  2. Connect the graphs to Dynamic AI’s tool proxy so TradingView webhooks and
     MT5 logs are normalized with shared validators.
  3. Add regression notebooks that replay archived market events through each
     graph to detect prompt drift before deployment.
- **Optimization tips:**
  - Cache frequently accessed embeddings in the vector store to reduce latency
    during high-frequency trading windows.
  - Use streaming callbacks to surface intermediate rationales to the control
    plane for early anomaly detection.

## 2. [AutoGPT — Autonomous Task Orchestration](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT)

- **Role:** Acts as the autonomous mission planner that expands prompts into
  sequenced research, tooling, and validation steps.
- **Why it matters:** Creates deterministic action graphs the Dynamic AGI
  control plane can score, trace, and replay.
- **Dynamic Capital use case:** Drive multi-stage market investigations—news
  scanning, liquidity checks, compliance sign-offs—before handing a decision to
  downstream agents.
- **Implementation steps:**
  1. Template AutoGPT mission definitions for core market scenarios and publish
     them to the adapter registry with semantic versioning.
  2. Configure guardrails that require human approval when a mission requests
     privileged tooling or exceeds the compliance depth threshold.
  3. Integrate mission outputs with LangChain’s memory buffers so downstream
     agents inherit the structured context automatically.
- **Optimization tips:**
  - Prefetch mission graphs during pre-market hours so live signals only trigger
    execution, not compilation.
  - Capture telemetry on token usage per mission to refine when AutoGPT should
    be invoked versus lighter-weight planners.

## 3. [LLM360 / Hugging Face Transformers — Core Reasoning Models](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)

- **Role:** Provide open-source large language models for decision intelligence.
- **Why it matters:** These models are transparent, fine-tunable, and auditable,
  avoiding reliance on closed APIs.
- **Dynamic Capital use case:** Train and adapt models on mentorship
  transcripts, trade rationales, and localized Maldivian market content.
- **Implementation steps:**
  1. Select baseline checkpoints for multilingual reasoning, structured
     analysis, and low-latency routing; document benchmark scores per target
     task.
  2. Fine-tune using LoRA adapters stored in the internal artifact registry so
     rollbacks remain instant.
  3. Deploy inference endpoints behind the Dynamic AI scheduler with autoscaling
     rules tuned for expected throughput.
- **Optimization tips:**
  - Enable mixed-precision inference to reduce VRAM consumption while retaining
    accuracy.
  - Schedule nightly evaluation jobs that replay curated market transcripts to
    detect performance regression.

## 4. [SuperAGI — Autonomous Agent Framework](https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI)

- **Role:** Supplies multi-agent planning, execution, and self-improvement APIs.
- **Why it matters:** Enables specialized personas such as TradingAgent,
  TreasuryAgent, and MentorAgent that collaborate and enforce guardrails.
- **Dynamic Capital use case:** Facilitate agent debates over market signals,
  apply governance policies, and require consensus before execution.
- **Implementation steps:**
  1. Map each SuperAGI persona to Dynamic Capital governance policies and store
     the mapping in the control plane registry.
  2. Configure debate workflows that fan out LangChain-normalized contexts to
     persona-specific prompts.
  3. Route consensus outputs through AutoGPT or LangChain post-processors to
     maintain a single reasoning ledger.
- **Optimization tips:**
  - Enable adaptive debate depth: shorten loops during low-risk trades and
    expand debates for high-risk exposures.
  - Use structured logging so stalled debates can be replayed and trimmed
    quickly.

## 5. PennyLane / TensorFlow Quantum — Quantum Integration

- **Role:** Deliver hybrid quantum-classical machine learning interfaces.
- **Why it matters:** Supports the "quantum sequences" vision by encoding
  conviction, risk, and volatility as quantum states.
- **Dynamic Capital use case:** Optimize lot sizing, slippage prediction, and
  portfolio allocation with variational quantum circuits.
- **Implementation steps:**
  1. Start with simulator backends to validate circuit templates before hitting
     real quantum hardware.
  2. Convert AutoGPT or SuperAGI recommendations into parameterized quantum
     features (risk bands, volatility bins, conviction scores).
  3. Feed optimized parameters back into Dynamic Task Automation via LangChain
     callbacks.
- **Optimization tips:**
  - Cache circuit compilation artifacts to shrink iteration time.
  - Schedule hardware runs during off-peak windows to minimize queue delays.

## 6. SingularityNET — Governance & Marketplace

- **Role:** Offers a decentralized marketplace and governance fabric for AI
  services.
- **Why it matters:** Adds blockchain-based provenance, incentive alignment, and
  transparent governance workflows.
- **Dynamic Capital use case:** Log AGI rationales on-chain, reward mentors, and
  enforce DCT tokenomics with auditable trails.
- **Implementation steps:**
  1. Register Dynamic Capital services within the SingularityNET marketplace and
     map each to the relevant governance policy.
  2. Stream reasoning metadata (mission IDs, consensus outcomes, quantum
     modifiers) into on-chain events for auditability.
  3. Wire payouts and staking flows into the DCT treasury smart contracts with
     automated reconciliation jobs.
- **Optimization tips:**
  - Batch on-chain writes when possible to reduce gas consumption.
  - Mirror key events into the internal telemetry lake for cross-checking and
    faster incident response.

## Integration Flow

1. **TradingView / MT5 ingestion.** Normalize alerts through LangChain graphs
   with schema validation and telemetry hooks.
2. **AutoGPT mission planning.** Expand qualified signals into deterministic
   action graphs and stage compliance checkpoints.
3. **SuperAGI consensus.** Launch persona debates that critique mission steps
   and surface guardrail conflicts.
4. **LLM360 / Hugging Face reasoning.** Execute fine-tuned models to narrate
   final rationales and produce structured decisions.
5. **PennyLane / TensorFlow Quantum optimization.** Translate mission outputs
   into quantum parameter sweeps that optimize position sizing.
6. **Dynamic Task Automation.** Route approved decisions to execution bridges
   while logging rationale hashes for auditability.
7. **SingularityNET governance.** Emit on-chain events, distribute incentives,
   and close the feedback loop with compliance reporting.

> **Implementation review tip:** After each deployment pass through the flow in
> a staging environment and confirm telemetry exists for every hand-off before
> promoting to production.

## Beginner-Friendly Mini App Layer

- **Guided explanations:** LangChain combined with Hugging Face models can
  answer foundational questions (e.g., "What is a pip?") with analogies and
  glossary links.
- **Mentor personas:** SuperAGI's MentorAgent persona tracks user progress,
  responds to learning queries, and provides scaffolded feedback.
- **Quantum storytelling:** PennyLane integrations remain abstracted, but user
  interfaces can celebrate successful "quantum-optimized" trades.
- **On-chain transparency:** SingularityNET events inform users when their
  trades trigger DCT burns or governance votes, reinforcing the platform's
  accountability.
