# Dynamic AGI Starter Stack

This document captures the baseline open-source stack that can power the Dynamic
AGI training pipeline while staying approachable for new contributors and end
users. The components below balance orchestration, reasoning, quantum
experimentation, and governance.

## 1. LangChain — Orchestration Layer

- **Role:** Acts as the "nervous system" that chains models, memory, and tools.
- **Why it matters:** Normalizes incoming signals, manages conversational
  context, and routes queries between Dynamic Thought Logic (DTL) and Dynamic
  Task Automation (DTA).
- **Dynamic Capital use case:** Wrap TradingView alerts and MetaTrader 5 (MT5)
  logs into structured prompts before handing them to downstream reasoning
  agents.

## 2. LLM360 / Hugging Face Transformers — Core Reasoning Models

- **Role:** Provide open-source large language models for decision intelligence.
- **Why it matters:** These models are transparent, fine-tunable, and auditable,
  avoiding reliance on closed APIs.
- **Dynamic Capital use case:** Train and adapt models on mentorship
  transcripts, trade rationales, and localized Maldivian market content.

## 3. SuperAGI — Autonomous Agent Framework

- **Role:** Supplies multi-agent planning, execution, and self-improvement APIs.
- **Why it matters:** Enables specialized personas such as TradingAgent,
  TreasuryAgent, and MentorAgent that collaborate and enforce guardrails.
- **Dynamic Capital use case:** Facilitate agent debates over market signals,
  apply governance policies, and require consensus before execution.

## 4. PennyLane / TensorFlow Quantum — Quantum Integration

- **Role:** Deliver hybrid quantum-classical machine learning interfaces.
- **Why it matters:** Supports the "quantum sequences" vision by encoding
  conviction, risk, and volatility as quantum states.
- **Dynamic Capital use case:** Optimize lot sizing, slippage prediction, and
  portfolio allocation with variational quantum circuits.

## 5. SingularityNET — Governance & Marketplace

- **Role:** Offers a decentralized marketplace and governance fabric for AI
  services.
- **Why it matters:** Adds blockchain-based provenance, incentive alignment, and
  transparent governance workflows.
- **Dynamic Capital use case:** Log AGI rationales on-chain, reward mentors, and
  enforce DCT tokenomics with auditable trails.

## Integration Flow

```
TradingView / MT5
   ↓ (signal normalization via LangChain)
SuperAGI multi-agent debate
   ↓ (rationale scoring)
LLM360 / Hugging Face reasoning
   ↓ (decision outputs)
PennyLane / TensorFlow Quantum optimization
   ↓ (execution modifiers)
Dynamic Task Automation (order routing)
   ↓
SingularityNET / DCT governance + tokenomics synchronization
```

## Beginner-Friendly Mini App Layer

- **Guided explanations:** LangChain combined with Hugging Face models can
  answer foundational questions (e.g., "What is a pip?") with analogies and
  glossary links.
- **Mentor personas:** SuperAGI's MentorAgent persona tracks user progress,
  responds to learning queries, and provides scaffolded feedback.
- **Quantum storytelling:** PennyLane integrations remain abstracted, but user
  interfaces can celebrate successful "quantum-optimized" trades.
- **On-chain transparency:** SingularityNET events inform users when their
  trades trigger DCT burns or governance votes, reinforcing the platform's
  accountability.

## Next Steps

- Prototype LangChain chains that ingest TradingView webhooks and MT5 logs.
- Stand up SuperAGI agents with clear guardrails and voting logic.
- Evaluate LLM360 or Hugging Face checkpoints aligned with Dynamic Capital's
  domain language.
- Explore PennyLane tutorials for variational quantum circuit design tailored to
  trading strategies.
- Define SingularityNET workflows for recording rationale metadata and
  distributing DCT incentives.
