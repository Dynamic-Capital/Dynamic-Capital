# Fundamental Forces, Gravity, and Cosmological Expansion

## Overview

This guide summarizes how modern physics models the fundamental interactions of
nature across the quantum and cosmological scales. It highlights the core field
equations, the physical quantities they relate, and the regimes where each
framework applies.

## Gravity on Large Scales: General Relativity

Einstein's field equations describe how mass-energy determines the curvature of
spacetime:

\[ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}} T_{\mu\nu} \]

- **Einstein tensor (\(G_{\mu\nu}\))**: Encodes the curvature of spacetime.
- **Metric tensor (\(g_{\mu\nu}\))**: Defines distances and the geometric
  structure of spacetime.
- **Cosmological constant (\(\Lambda\))**: Represents vacuum energy density or
  dark energy.
- **Newton's gravitational constant (\(G\))**: Sets the strength of
  gravitational interaction.
- **Speed of light (\(c\))**: Governs the conversion between mass/energy and
  spacetime curvature.
- **Stress-energy tensor (\(T_{\mu\nu}\))**: Captures the density and flux of
  energy and momentum.

These equations generalize Newtonian gravity, predicting phenomena such as
gravitational time dilation, black holes, and gravitational waves.

## Electromagnetism on Smaller Scales: Maxwell's Equations

Electric and magnetic fields arise from charges and currents and evolve
according to Maxwell's equations:

\[ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_{0}}, \qquad \nabla \cdot
\mathbf{B} = 0, \] \[ \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial
\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}, \qquad \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_{0} \mathbf{J} +
\mu_{0} \varepsilon_{0} \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}. \]

- **\(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{B}\)**: Electric and magnetic field vectors.
- **\(\rho, \mathbf{J}\)**: Charge and current densities.
- **\(\varepsilon_{0}, \mu_{0}\)**: Vacuum permittivity and permeability.

These equations explain electromagnetic waves, optics, and the behavior of
charged particles.

## Strong and Weak Nuclear Forces: The Standard Model

At subatomic scales, the Standard Model unifies electromagnetic, weak, and
strong interactions within a quantum field theory framework:

- **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** governs the strong force using the SU(3)
  gauge symmetry of color charge. Its equations describe gluon-mediated binding
  of quarks into hadrons.
- **Electroweak theory** unifies the weak and electromagnetic interactions under
  SU(2) × U(1) gauge symmetry, accounting for processes like beta decay and
  neutrino interactions.

These sectors rely on complex Lagrangians and renormalization techniques rather
than a single compact equation.

## Cosmological Expansion: Friedmann Equations

For a homogeneous and isotropic universe, the Friedmann equations track the time
evolution of the scale factor \(a(t)\):

\[ \left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^{2} = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{k
c^{2}}{a^{2}}, \qquad \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3} \left( \rho +
\frac{3p}{c^{2}} \right). \]

- **Scale factor derivatives (\(\dot{a}, \ddot{a}\))**: Measure expansion rate
  and acceleration.
- **Curvature parameter (\(k\))**: Distinguishes open, flat, or closed spatial
  geometries.
- **Energy density and pressure (\(\rho, p\))**: Include matter, radiation, and
  dark energy components.

These equations underpin modern cosmology, including the Big Bang model and
accelerated expansion.

## Quantum Entanglement

Quantum mechanics permits entangled states, where the combined system has
correlations that cannot be factored into independent subsystems. A maximally
entangled Bell state is:

\[ |\Psi^{+}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|00\rangle + |11\rangle). \]

This superposition of joint spin states leads to nonlocal correlations confirmed
by Bell-test experiments.

## Toward Unification: String Theory

String theory proposes that one-dimensional strings, not point particles, are
the fundamental entities. Different vibrational modes of strings correspond to
particles, naturally incorporating gravity via a spin-2 graviton excitation. The
theory is formulated through actions like the Nambu–Goto or Polyakov action and
requires extra dimensions and supersymmetry for consistency. While not
encapsulated by a single simple equation, string theory aims to unify all forces
within a consistent quantum framework.
