# Fundamental Forces & Cosmology Review Playbook

Dynamic Capital runs complex, multi-agent systems that benefit from thinking in
terms of conservation laws, curvature, and long-horizon cosmology. This playbook
translates the governing equations of the universe into a repeatable **Review →
Optimize** loop for treasury, product, and infrastructure squads.

## Core Equations to Track

| Concept             | Equation                                                                                              | Why It Matters Operationally                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Friedmann expansion | \(\left( \tfrac{\dot a}{a} \right)^2 = \tfrac{8\pi G}{3} \rho - \tfrac{k}{a^2} + \tfrac{\Lambda}{3}\) | Connects expansion rate (deployment velocity) with resource density and structural debt (curvature \(k\)).                                                |
| Equation of state   | \(w = \tfrac{p}{\rho}\)                                                                               | Gauges how "stiff" a portfolio or roadmap is: \(w = -1\) locks in steady burn, \(w < -1\) signals runaway commitments.                                    |
| Critical density    | \(\Omega = \tfrac{\rho}{\rho_c}\), where \(\rho_c = \tfrac{3 H^2}{8\pi G}\)                           | Benchmarks whether current runway plus pipeline coverage is above (\(\Omega > 1\)) or below (\(\Omega < 1\)) what is needed for sustainable acceleration. |

**Review checklist (weekly):**

1. Pull the latest Supabase telemetry for treasury balances, trading yields, and
   burn.
2. Compute operational analogues for \(H\) (execution velocity), \(\rho\)
   (resource density), and \(\Omega\) (coverage vs. demand).
3. Flag any desks or initiatives where \(|w + 1| > 0.1\); that deviation hints
   at phase changes that need action.

**Optimize checklist (weekly):**

- Adjust capital or staffing so that \(\Omega\) stays within 0.95–1.05 unless a
  deliberate growth sprint is underway.
- Rebalance OKRs or backlog slices whenever \(w\) drifts toward phantom (\(<
  -1\)) or matter-dominated (\(> -\tfrac{1}{3}\)) regimes.
- Update the shared Linear or Jira log so each review artifact has a matching
  optimization ticket before the meeting ends.

## Scenario Guardrails

Three cosmological endgames mirror the dominant ways a complex program can
unravel. Use them as stress lenses for quarterly planning.

### Big Freeze (Heat Death)

- **Physics trigger:** Dark energy behaves like a cosmological constant with \(w
  = -1\). The scale factor grows exponentially: \(a(t) \propto e^{Ht}\).
- **Operational smell:** Automation hums but marginal ROI decays; teams are
  stretched across too many silent systems.

**Review**

- Track the decay of signal-to-noise in trading models and customer engagement.
- Audit dormant repos and cron jobs—anything with zero incidents but also zero
  learning.

**Optimize**

- Consolidate tooling; sunset processes with negligible feedback.
- Redirect capacity into experiments that raise \(\rho\) (useful energy density)
  so the execution "temperature" does not approach zero.

### Big Crunch

- **Physics trigger:** \(\Omega > 1\) and \(w > -\tfrac{1}{3}\) so gravity wins;
  the scale factor peaks then collapses.
- **Operational smell:** Too many initiatives packed into a finite runway.
  Backlogs pile up, regression pace slows, and risk buffers shrink.

**Review**

- Compare aggregate roadmap load against sustainable throughput each sprint.
- Inspect liquidity buffers and hedges—are we over-levered relative to burn?

**Optimize**

- Pause or sequence projects until \(\Omega\) drops toward 1 (capacity matches
  commitments).
- Rebuild safety margins: raise hedging, enforce release gates, and ensure each
  dependency has an owner before shipping more scope.

### Big Rip

- **Physics trigger:** Phantom energy with \(w < -1\) drives \(H\) to infinity
  in finite time: \(a(t) \propto \frac{1}{(t_{BR} - t)^{\alpha}}\).
- **Operational smell:** Growth mandates outpace observability. SLAs and
  guardrails tear faster than we can patch.

**Review**

- Watch leading indicators: deploy frequency vs. incident response time, debt
  accumulation vs. fix velocity.
- Stress-test integrations for cascading failures—phantom energy analogues show
  up as unbounded retries or recursive automations.

**Optimize**

- Institute rate limits, kill switches, and blast-radius containment before the
  next release wave.
- Reinforce telemetry (distributed tracing, anomaly alerts) so that runaway
  loops are damped within minutes, not hours.

## Hand-offs and Cadence

| Artifact                         | Review Owner    | Optimize Owner      | Frequency |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| Treasury curvature dashboard     | Treasury + Risk | Treasury            | Daily     |
| Product throughput vs. load      | PM + Eng Lead   | PM                  | Weekly    |
| Incident & observability heatmap | SRE             | SRE + Feature teams | Weekly    |
| Quarterly cosmology brief        | Strategy        | ELT                 | Quarterly |

Every artifact must record the **Review** snapshot, the chosen **Optimize**
intervention, and the resulting metric shift. That tight feedback loop prevents
our universe from drifting toward any catastrophic fate.
