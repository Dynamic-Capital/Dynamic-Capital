# Dynamic Training Model Architecture

## Overview

The Dynamic Capital training stack combines three modular domains—Dynamic AI
(DAI), Dynamic AGI (DAGI), and Dynamic AGS (DAGS)—to deliver progressive
learning with tight governance controls. Each domain owns a distinct set of
cores, capability areas, and oversight pillars that can be activated
independently or orchestrated in concert.

- **DAI** delivers the reasoning mesh, feature detection, and integration
  surfaces that feed analytics into the broader system.
- **DAGI** scales general intelligence capabilities, aligning strategic,
  creative, and ethical reasoning across domains.
- **DAGS** enforces governance, synchronization, and reliability so that DAI and
  DAGI operate safely at scale.

## DAI: 11-Core Training Mesh

| Core   | Type                | Primary Focus                    |
| ------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| core1  | Data Processing     | Data ingestion and normalization |
| core2  | Pattern Recognition | Feature detection and analysis   |
| core3  | Predictive Modeling | Trend forecasting                |
| core4  | Risk Assessment     | Probability and impact analysis  |
| core5  | Optimization        | Parameter tuning and efficiency  |
| core6  | Adaptive Learning   | Continuous improvement loops     |
| core7  | Decision Logic      | Rule-based reasoning             |
| core8  | Memory Management   | Knowledge retention              |
| core9  | Context Analysis    | Situational awareness            |
| core10 | Validation          | Output verification              |
| core11 | Integration         | Cross-core synchronization       |

### Implementation Notes

- Start with `core1`–`core3` to bootstrap ingestion, pattern recognition, and
  forecasting.
- Add `core6` and `core7` when adaptive feedback loops and decision rules are
  required.
- Reserve `core10` and `core11` for integration testing and production handoff.

## DAGI: 9 Domain Capability Lanes

| Domain  | Capability                  | Training Emphasis                 |
| ------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| domain1 | Natural Language Processing | Language models and comprehension |
| domain2 | Strategic Planning          | Long-term goal optimization       |
| domain3 | Problem Solving             | Multi-step reasoning              |
| domain4 | Knowledge Synthesis         | Information integration           |
| domain5 | Creative Generation         | Novel solution creation           |
| domain6 | Ethical Reasoning           | Value-aligned decision making     |
| domain7 | Social Intelligence         | Interaction and communication     |
| domain8 | Self-Reflection             | Metacognition and improvement     |
| domain9 | Cross-Domain Transfer       | Skill application across contexts |

### Implementation Notes

- Anchor early experiments in `domain1` and `domain2` to validate language and
  planning.
- Schedule `domain5`–`domain7` once the system requires creative ideation and
  collaborative behaviors.
- Keep `domain8` and `domain9` in continuous evaluation cycles to measure
  cross-domain generalization.

## DAGS: 5 Pillars of Governance

| Pillar        | Training Focus Areas                                         | Core Methods                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Governance    | Policy enforcement, compliance monitoring, decision auditing | Rule-based learning, constraint optimization        |
| Sync          | Temporal coordination, data consistency, process alignment   | Distributed systems training, clock synchronization |
| Memory        | Knowledge retention, experience logging, state management    | Vector databases, retrieval systems                 |
| Observability | System monitoring, performance metrics, anomaly detection    | Log analysis, metric aggregation                    |
| Reliability   | Fault tolerance, backup systems, recovery protocols          | Redundancy training, failover testing               |

### Implementation Notes

- Establish the Governance pillar first to codify policy and audit requirements.
- Pair Sync and Observability for live operations so telemetry confirms data
  alignment.
- Stress test Reliability alongside Memory updates to validate disaster recovery
  exercises.

## Phased Training Orchestration

The training program advances from foundation to integration using the following
phases:

1. **Foundation Training (4 weeks)**
   - DAI cores: `core1`, `core2`, `core3`
   - DAGI domains: `domain1`, `domain2`
   - DAGS pillars: Governance, Reliability
2. **Specialization Training (6 weeks)**
   - Expand DAI coverage across advanced patterning, optimization, and adaptive
     loops.
   - Activate DAGI domains for problem solving, synthesis, creativity, and
     ethics.
   - Layer DAGS Sync, Memory, and Observability for operational oversight.
3. **Integration Training (2 weeks)**
   - Exercise DAI `core10` and `core11` for validation and cross-core
     synchronization.
   - Cross-train DAGI `domain8` and `domain9` on multi-domain workloads.
   - Run full-stack drills through all DAGS pillars to ensure governance
     readiness.

## Deployment Checklist

1. Instantiate the training model scaffold and confirm core/domain/pillar
   registration.
2. Provision data pipelines that satisfy the domain-specific data requirements.
3. Schedule the three-phase training program with stakeholder sign-off at each
   gate.
4. Configure metric dashboards aligned to the evaluation matrix above.
5. Conduct integration reviews with DAGS governance leads before production
   rollouts.

## Next Steps

- Extend the orchestration layer with automated runbooks for each phase
  checkpoint.
- Map DAI/DAGI artifacts to Supabase storage policies described in the
  governance playbooks.
- Add regression tests to verify that newly activated cores or domains report
  metrics through the Observability pillar.
