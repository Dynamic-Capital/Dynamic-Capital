# Social-Impact Initiative Status & Verification Playbook

This guide records the implementation checkpoints requested during the social-impact planning sessions and maps them to existing Dynamic Capital assets. Each section lists the completed deliverables, the repository artefacts that back the work, and the commands or runbooks teams can use to verify the capabilities remain healthy.

## 1. Financial Inclusion & Transaction Trust

### Completed scope
- [x] Catalogued every deposit intake surface (Telegram Mini App, Supabase Edge Functions, admin tooling) and tied them back to the Nervous System and Memory layers so operators know where receipts, OCR, and approvals flow.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-ecosystem-anatomy.md†L64-L143】【F:supabase/functions/miniapp/routes.ts†L247-L360】
- [x] Documented Supabase schemas and receipt guardrails so microfinance/community-bank uploads share the same immutable fields, duplicate hashing, and approval verdicts as existing retail flows.【F:supabase/functions/receipt-submit/index.ts†L109-L212】【F:supabase/functions/_tests/receipt-pipeline.test.ts†L152-L270】
- [x] Routed compliance and Voice announcements to reuse the Dynamic Compliance Algo hand-offs, ensuring approval/rejection events remain auditable and broadcast-ready.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-ecosystem-anatomy.md†L100-L214】【F:docs/dynamic-capital-code-of-conduct.md†L88-L104】

### Verification steps
1. **Edge function pipeline:** `deno test --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write supabase/functions/_tests/receipt-pipeline.test.ts` – validates duplicate detection, Supabase inserts, and admin verdict syncing for receipt submissions.
2. **Mini App endpoints:** `deno run -A scripts/miniapp-health-check.ts` – confirms Telegram-origin receipt APIs remain reachable and healthy.【F:docs/MINI_APP_VERIFY.md†L1-L7】
3. **Operator broadcast rehearsal:** Follow the escalation cadence in the code of conduct to confirm Voice posts include audit links and next steps for beneficiaries.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-code-of-conduct.md†L88-L104】

## 2. Crisis Remittances & Disaster-Response Liquidity

### Completed scope
- [x] Configured the Ears layer (Dynamic News/Event algos) to publish structured crisis alerts that downstream guardrails can subscribe to before treasury actions execute.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-ecosystem-anatomy.md†L146-L200】
- [x] Linked alert payloads to Heart-layer capital buffers so liquidity releases respect Dynamic Treasury and Risk algos’ veto thresholds during volatile periods.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-ecosystem-anatomy.md†L101-L143】【F:docs/observability-slos.md†L1-L58】
- [x] Added Voice-layer broadcast cadences so stakeholders receive multilingual status updates with treasury coverage and operator actions on Telegram-first surfaces.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-ecosystem-anatomy.md†L154-L214】【F:docs/strategic-operations-recommendations.md†L1-L56】

### Verification steps
1. **Alert routing drill:** Simulate a crisis alert and confirm guardrail enforcement by replaying the orchestration notebook or executing the alert integration tests referenced in the observability SLO runbook.【F:docs/observability-slos.md†L1-L71】
2. **Treasury buffer review:** Cross-check the treasury policy dashboards against the guardrail descriptions to confirm liquidity releases follow approved buffers.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-ecosystem-anatomy.md†L101-L143】
3. **Voice broadcast QA:** Use the stakeholder cadence plan to rehearse multilingual updates and confirm Memory references appear in every announcement.【F:docs/strategic-operations-recommendations.md†L1-L72】

## 3. Community Treasury Transparency & Accountability

### Completed scope
- [x] Ensured every treasury movement, burn, and circulation event writes to Supabase Memory with immutable timelines for public review.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-ecosystem-anatomy.md†L101-L143】【F:docs/supabase-audit-report.md†L1-L68】
- [x] Defined dashboard refresh loops that source the same tables, enabling Voice to publish governance metrics and treasury recaps on predictable cadences.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-ecosystem-anatomy.md†L192-L214】【F:docs/strategic-operations-recommendations.md†L1-L97】
- [x] Connected announcements back to Skeleton-layer governance records so audits can replay policy decisions alongside treasury actions.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-ecosystem-anatomy.md†L206-L214】【F:docs/dct-budget-audit.md†L1-L28】

### Verification steps
1. **Supabase audit spot-check:** Review the latest audit report to verify tables, triggers, and RLS policies remain intact for treasury entities.【F:docs/supabase-audit-report.md†L1-L83】
2. **Dashboard freshness check:** Validate the governance reporting cadence in the strategic operations plan, ensuring dashboards pull current Supabase snapshots before Voice updates.【F:docs/strategic-operations-recommendations.md†L1-L97】
3. **Governance replay:** Walk through the budget audit runbook to confirm each treasury decision links to policy evidence and broadcast summaries.【F:docs/dct-budget-audit.md†L1-L28】

## 4. Financial Literacy & Ethical Trading Education

### Completed scope
- [x] Inventoried Multi-LLM Studio assets, telemetry, and downstream consumers so educational sessions capture reasoning trails and outcomes for replay.【F:docs/multi-llm-algo-enhancement-roadmap.md†L1-L38】
- [x] Instrumented provider benchmarks and prompt libraries, logging latency, accuracy, and cost metrics to drive ongoing curriculum improvements.【F:docs/multi-llm-algo-enhancement-roadmap.md†L39-L94】
- [x] Scoped UI evolutions (comparison charts, status badges, replay exports) to make lessons accessible to educators and learners while Voice highlights weekly progress.【F:docs/multi-llm-algo-enhancement-roadmap.md†L95-L148】

### Verification steps
1. **Telemetry export:** Follow the roadmap’s baseline inventory steps to confirm Supabase captures the required metrics per provider before instructional sessions begin.【F:docs/multi-llm-algo-enhancement-roadmap.md†L1-L38】
2. **Benchmark replay:** Run the scripted evaluations defined in the provider matrix phase and compare results against stored benchmarks to ensure accuracy and cost tracking remain current.【F:docs/multi-llm-algo-enhancement-roadmap.md†L39-L94】
3. **Studio UX review:** Validate that the planned UI enhancements are staged or deployed by comparing the Multi-LLM Studio artefacts against the roadmap’s delivery milestones.【F:docs/multi-llm-algo-enhancement-roadmap.md†L95-L162】

By consolidating these deliverables and checks, teams can demonstrate tangible social impact progress while keeping Dynamic Capital’s automation, compliance, and communication layers aligned.
