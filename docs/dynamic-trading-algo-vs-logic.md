# Dynamic Trading ALGO vs LOGIC

Dynamic Capital now frames its trading automation stack across two complementary
pillars:

- **Dynamic Trading ALGO** — Driving Yield of New Advancements in Markets,
  Intelligence & Creation — **Automated Liquidity Generation & Optimization**
  for trading execution.
- **Dynamic Trading LOGIC** — Driving Yield of New Advancements in Markets,
  Intelligence & Creation — **Leveraging Optimized Global Intelligence &
  Computation** for trading decisions.

Together they form a complete decision-to-execution flywheel where LOGIC
determines _why_ to act and ALGO manages _how_ the action is delivered.

## Capability split

### Dynamic Trading ALGO — execution engine

- Automates order routing, liquidity sourcing, and broker/exchange handshakes.
- Coordinates real-time bots, hedging routines, and fail-safes that protect
  capital during volatile sessions.
- Converts validated strategies into executable instructions with consistent
  position sizing, risk bands, and settlement workflows.

### Dynamic Trading LOGIC — strategy intelligence

- Concentrates the AI/ML research stack that evaluates signals, cross-market
  correlations, and regime shifts.
- Chooses which strategies to activate, pause, or recalibrate based on
  probabilistic edge, macro context, and portfolio constraints.
- Provides explainability payloads to traders, auditors, and downstream
  automation teams so human oversight remains informed.

## How they collaborate

1. **LOGIC ideates and validates** — Strategy research agents curate signals,
   assess their historical performance, and simulate forward-looking scenarios.
2. **ALGO operationalizes** — Execution pipelines translate those signals into
   broker-ready commands, applying guardrails, throttles, and liquidity
   heuristics.
3. **Closed-loop feedback** — Execution telemetry flows back into the LOGIC
   layer so models can refine confidence scores, retrain, or request manual
   review.
4. **Product alignment** — Treat LOGIC as the "strategy brain" and ALGO as the
   "execution hands" when packaging capabilities, roadmaps, or service-level
   agreements.

Maintaining a sharp separation between these pillars keeps the system modular:
LOGIC experiments can evolve rapidly without destabilizing the ALGO rails, while
ALGO enhancements improve resilience without altering strategic intent.
