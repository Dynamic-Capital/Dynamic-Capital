# DCT Token Automation Blueprint

This document captures the automation logic that ties DCT token economics to AGI
performance, treasury profits, and cross-service pricing. It consolidates
execution flows, governance touchpoints, and telemetry requirements for future
smart contract implementations.

## 1. AGI-Driven Burn Mechanics

The burn routine links AGI intelligence growth to DCT supply reductions. The
pseudocode below assumes a dedicated AGI agent triggers burns when verifiable
improvements are recorded.

```solidity
function burnDCT(uint256 intelligenceDelta) external onlyAGI {
    uint256 burnAmount = intelligenceDelta * burnCoefficient;
    require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= burnAmount, "Insufficient DCT");
    _burn(msg.sender, burnAmount);
    emit Burned(msg.sender, burnAmount);
}
```

**Key inputs**

- `intelligenceDelta` represents the performance increase reported by the AGI
  intelligence oracle (e.g., mentorship outcomes, trading accuracy, signal
  reliability).
- `burnCoefficient` is a governance-controlled multiplier that converts
  performance delta into a burn amount.
- The `onlyAGI` modifier restricts who can initiate the burnâ€”only authorized AGI
  modules can call this function.

**Operational notes**

1. Governance adjusts `burnCoefficient` to modulate deflation intensity as AGI
   modules mature.
2. Burn events should be recorded in the treasury ledger alongside the
   intelligence delta that triggered them for transparent auditing.
3. If the AGI wallet lacks sufficient DCT, the burn reverts and a shortfall
   event is logged for remediation.

## 2. Revenue-Backed Buybacks

Treasury profits fuel periodic buybacks that increase price support and add
additional burn pressure when paired with the AGI routine.

```solidity
function executeBuyback() external onlyTreasury {
    uint256 buybackAmount = revenuePool * buybackRatio;
    swapTONforDCT(buybackAmount);
    emit BuybackExecuted(buybackAmount);
}
```

**Parameters**

- `revenuePool`: Aggregated TON or stablecoin reserves earmarked for market
  operations.
- `buybackRatio`: DAO-controlled percentage defining how much of the pool is
  deployed each cycle.
- `swapTONforDCT`: Integrates with an on-chain DEX or liquidity pool to
  repurchase DCT.

**Execution checklist**

1. Treasury automation populates `revenuePool` after settling expenses and
   buffer allocations.
2. Governance proposals can raise or lower `buybackRatio` based on runway
   targets and volatility.
3. Buybacks route through approved venues and respect per-venue limits defined
   in treasury policy.
4. Optional burn hook can retire a portion of acquired DCT immediately after the
   swap.

## 3. Service Price Synchronisation

Market-maker automation keeps pricing consistent across mentorship, education,
and signals modules.

```solidity
function syncServicePrices() external {
    uint256 avgPrice = getDCTPriceFromOracle();
    for (uint i = 0; i < services.length; i++) {
        services[i].updatePrice(avgPrice + volatilityBuffer);
    }
    emit PricesSynced(avgPrice);
}
```

**Workflow**

1. `getDCTPriceFromOracle()` pulls the current DCT price from approved oracles
   or VWAP feeds.
2. A `volatilityBuffer` smooths out rapid swings by adding a governance-tuned
   spread.
3. Each registered service contract recalculates its exchange rate or membership
   fee using the synchronized baseline.

**Risk controls**

- If oracle data lags beyond a defined SLA, the sync is skipped and an alert is
  raised.
- Services maintain local caps to prevent sudden price jumps from exceeding user
  protection thresholds.

## 4. Governance Responsibilities

| Parameter                 | Controller           | Voting method                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `burnCoefficient`         | DAO token holders    | Staked-weight voting             |
| `buybackRatio`            | DAO token holders    | Proposal with quorum             |
| `servicePricingRules`     | Core devs + DAO      | Hybrid (multisig + ratification) |
| `AGI Intelligence Oracle` | Verified AGI modules | Proof-of-performance attestation |

**Governance considerations**

- All parameter changes should emit events and update an on-chain registry so
  off-chain dashboards stay aligned.
- Emergency pause controls allow the DAO multisig to halt burns, buybacks, or
  price syncs when market anomalies occur.

## 5. Telemetry & Dashboarding

A public dashboard should correlate AGI performance with DCT supply dynamics and
treasury actions.

| Metric                     | Description                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AGI Intelligence Score** | Composite index of mentorship, trading, and feedback performance.            |
| **DCT Burn Rate**          | Tokens burned per intelligence delta unit.                                   |
| **Buyback Volume**         | TON deployed for DCT buybacks over the selected period.                      |
| **Synced Service Price**   | Current cross-service price baseline post-volatility buffer.                 |
| **Mentorship ROI**         | Comparison of DCT earned by mentors versus DCT burned by AGI-linked actions. |

**Implementation notes**

- Stream oracle updates, burn events, and buyback executions into a unified
  analytics warehouse (e.g., Supabase or ClickHouse).
- Surface parameter history and governance outcomes so stakeholders can track
  how decisions influenced supply dynamics.
- Provide exportable CSVs or APIs for auditors and quant researchers to validate
  the burn/buyback cadence.

## 6. Next Steps

1. Formalize smart contract interfaces, including access controls for AGI
   modules and treasury executors.
2. Integrate the pseudocode with existing treasury automation pipelines and
   buyback bots.
3. Draft security reviews covering oracle manipulation, treasury custody, and
   governance attack vectors.
4. Prototype the dashboard using existing analytics infrastructure to test data
   freshness and completeness.
