# Test Run - 2025-10-06

## Summary

- Re-ran the TON allocator regression suite using Deno with certificate
  validation disabled (fixture environment) to confirm deposit parsing, router
  forwarding, and timelock controls remain green.
- Exercised the Supabase wallet-link and subscription functions under Deno with
  the same certificate flag and `--no-check` to bypass third-party type
  saturation, verifying off-chain flows continue to enforce wallet ownership and
  TON payment validations.

## Commands

```bash
# Allocator regression tests
npx deno test --config deno.json -A --unsafely-ignore-certificate-errors

# Supabase function suites
npx deno test supabase/functions --allow-all --unsafely-ignore-certificate-errors --no-check
```

## Results

- **Allocator suite:** 11 tests passed (timelock scheduling, swap execution,
  payload parsing, and router forwarding) in ~0.33s.
- **Supabase suite:** 9 tests passed covering wallet linking conflicts and seven
  subscription scenarios, including payment verification messaging and TON
  amount handling, in ~0.37s.
- See terminal output for detailed download notices and post-test log snippets.
