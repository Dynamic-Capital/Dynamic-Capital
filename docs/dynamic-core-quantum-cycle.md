# Dynamic Core Quantum Cycle

The Dynamic Core mythology can be mapped to quantum dynamical formalisms that
capture how information, energy, and state transitions circulate through the
stack. The Dynamic Core Maiden (DCM), Dynamic Core Hollow (DCH), and Dynamic
Core Revenant (DCR) mirror a canonical cycle in which a system begins in a pure
state, exchanges energy with an open environment, and re-emerges after
measurement in a renewed configuration.

## The dynamical loop

1. **Potential (DCM)** – The Dynamic Core begins in a coherent ground state
   \(\lvert \psi_0 \rangle\), representing untapped capability and high
   symmetry. In this phase the system is governed by the unperturbed Hamiltonian
   \(\hat{H}_0\) and retains full superpositional freedom.
2. **Perturbation and descent (DCM → DCH)** – An external drive \(V(t)\)
   introduces transitions and couples the Core to an extended environment. The
   state is promoted into the density-matrix formalism \(\rho\) as decoherence
   pathways open via Lindblad operators, signifying the Hollow’s embrace.
3. **Dissipation (within DCH)** – Non-Hermitian contributions \( -i\Gamma \)
   encode resource leakage, latency, and entropy production. Operationally, this
   phase captures telemetry drop-off, actuator back-pressure, and control-plane
   uncertainty while mythologically tracing the labyrinthine underworld.
4. **Quantum jump (DCH → DCR)** – A stochastic detection event \(dN_j\) produces
   a conditioned state update. The Dynamic Core collapses through measurement
   operators \(M_k\), consolidating the experience of decay into a new
   eigen-configuration with durable memory of the traversal.
5. **Renewal (back to DCM)** – The Revenant equilibrates, becoming the next
   ground state \(\lvert \psi_0' \rangle\). The cycle can restart with modified
   parameters \(\hat{H}_0'\) or new control protocols, demonstrating adaptive
   resilience across loops.

## Implementation cues for Dynamic Capital

- **Telemetry orchestration** – Treat pulse ingestion as the perturbative force
  that dislodges each subsystem from static baselines, aligning streaming
  metrics with \(V(t)\).
- **Resilience modelling** – Map service-level decay, queue leakage, and cache
  invalidation to Lindblad operators to quantify irreversibility within the
  Hollow.
- **Incident response** – Frame alert acknowledgements as quantum jumps that
  collapse operational ambiguity, allowing the Revenant phase to seed improved
  runbooks and circuit breakers for the next iteration.

This quantum-native framing ensures the Dynamic Core archetypes integrate with
Dynamic Capital’s mathematical language while preserving the narrative cadence
of descent, transformation, and return.
