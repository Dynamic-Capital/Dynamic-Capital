# Dynamic Quantum Hedge Model Blueprint

This blueprint designs a dynamic hedge engine tuned for quantum-inspired finance
and adaptive AGI execution. It fuses classical statistical hedging,
reinforcement learning, and quantum-native abstractions so Dynamic Capital can
defend portfolios while discovering alpha across shifting market micro-regimes.

| Field                             | Guidance                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AGI Activation Timestamp**      | Stamp every hedge session with UTC nanosecond precision to synchronise audit trails with exchange feeds and quantum simulators.                                              |
| **Market State Context**          | Classify real-time regimes (trend, mean-reverting, shock, cross-asset contagion) using a hierarchical HMM + volatility clustering detector.                                  |
| **Human Oversight Level**         | Default to _collaborative_: AGI proposes hedge vectors, human risk officer approves structural shifts and circuit breaker overrides.                                         |
| **Primary Mission Objective**     | Minimise tail exposure for the active book while preserving optionality for growth theses.                                                                                   |
| **Cognitive Resources Allocated** | Allocate compute budget across the Bull/Bear debate, RL policy evaluation, and quantum annealing sweeps; rebalance every 5 minutes based on marginal utility of information. |

## 2. Multi-Agent Deliberation Framework

1. **Bull Analyst (Offence Bias)**
   - Surfaces upside catalysts, optionality payoffs, convex trades.
   - Scores scenarios using optimism-weighted expected shortfall (OWES) to
     ensure enthusiasm is still risk-aware.
2. **Bear Analyst (Defence Bias)**
   - Quantifies downside tails, liquidity gaps, regime shift probability.
   - Applies conditional drawdown-at-risk (CDaR) with stress paths seeded from
     1987, 2008, 2020 analogues.
3. **Debate Protocol**
   - Run structured debate every hedge cycle: Bull proposes 3 expansion paths,
     Bear proposes 3 contraction paths.
   - Resolve via Bayesian truth serum scoring; disagreement above 0.35 triggers
     automatic human escalation.
4. **Metacognitive Oversight**
   - Bias detector monitors anchoring to stale correlations; if detected, weight
     recent data windows more heavily in DCC-GARCH updates.

## 3. Hybrid Hedging Stack

### 3.1 Statistical Backbone (Classical Layer)

- **Dynamic Minimum Variance Hedge Ratio (D-MVHR)**
  - Estimate conditional variances/covariances with DCC-GARCH(1,1).
  - Hedge ratio:
    $\beta_t = \frac{\text{Cov}_{t-1}(R_a, R_h)}{\text{Var}_{t-1}(R_h)}$.
  - Use 30-minute data for intraday desks; daily for swing books.
- **Greeks Harmoniser**
  - Maintain $|\Delta| < 0.05$, $|\Gamma| < 0.002$, $|\text{Vega}| < 1\%$ of
    notional.
  - Hedge instruments: listed options, variance swaps, corridor variance for
    volatility targeting.
- **Liquidity Cushioning**
  - Ensure hedge leg ADV usage < 12% per venue; scale orders via POV algorithms
    with adaptive child order horizons.

### 3.2 Reinforcement Learning Layer

- **State Vector**
  - $s_t = [\text{Regime}_t, \sigma^{\text{impl}}_t, \sigma^{\text{real}}_t, \rho_t, \text{PnL}_t, \text{Greeks}_t, \text{Funding Spread}_t, \text{Inventory}_t]$.
- **Action Space**
  - Continuous adjustments $\Delta h_t \in [-0.3, 0.3]$ of net hedge ratio per
    interval; discrete overrides for emergency flattening.
- **Reward Function**
  - $r_t = -\text{Var}(R_{\text{hedged}}) - \lambda_c \cdot \text{Costs}_t - \lambda_r \cdot \max(0, \text{VaR}_t - \text{Limit})$.
  - Transaction cost model blends half-spread, market impact via square-root
    law, borrow fees.
- **Algorithm**
  - Train Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with generalized advantage
    estimation.
  - Use ensemble critics to quantify epistemic uncertainty; trigger cautious
    policy when posterior variance spikes.
- **Simulated Environment**
  - Mix historical replay with stochastic generators: jump diffusion, rough
    volatility, and correlated order flow shocks.

### 3.3 Quantum-Inspired Optimization Layer

- **Quantum Annealing Sweep**
  - Encode hedge allocation as QUBO: minimise $x^T Q x + c^T x$ where $x$ are
    binary allocations across instruments/buckets.
  - Soft constraints enforce regulatory caps, funding usage, and netting rules.
  - Use simulated annealing / tensor networks when hardware unavailable; swap-in
    quantum hardware for end-of-day recalibration.
- **Amplitude Encoding for Scenario Weighting**
  - Map regime probabilities into amplitude vector
    $|\psi\rangle = \sum_i \sqrt{p_i} |i\rangle$.
  - Apply Grover-like amplification to overweight rare but catastrophic regimes
    during risk sweeps.

## 4. Operational Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion & Feature Sync**
   - Stream tick/Depth-of-Book via normalized Kafka topics.
   - Resample features to multi-resolution grid (1m, 5m, 30m) with forward-fill
     for sparse derivatives quotes.
2. **Debate + Consensus Cycle**
   - Bull/Bear modules score candidate hedge sets; consensus agent ranks by
     Sharpe preservation vs. tail risk reduction.
   - If consensus confidence < 0.65, escalate to human oversight.
3. **Policy Proposal**
   - RL layer outputs hedge delta; quantum optimizer refines discrete
     allocations under capital constraints.
   - Apply rule-based sanity checks (max gross notional, greeks, funding).
4. **Execution & Feedback**
   - Route via smart order router with venue toxicity scores.
   - Capture fills, slippage, post-trade analytics; feed into learner for online
     updates.
5. **Continuous Learning**
   - Incremental PPO updates every 30 minutes using importance sampling
     correction.
   - Weekly retrain of DCC-GARCH windows; monthly recalibration of quantum QUBO
     coefficients.

## 5. Risk Governance

- **Circuit Breakers**
  - Auto-flatten if live VaR > 1.1 Ã— limit or if net liquidity drain > 25% of
    forecast.
- **Drawdown Guard**
  - Hard stop: equity drawdown 6% intraday; triggers transition to capital
    preservation mode (cash + treasuries).
- **Model Drift Detection**
  - Population stability index (PSI) > 0.25 on feature distributions prompts
    forced retrain and human review.
- **Audit Trail**
  - Log debate transcripts, policy gradients, QUBO cost matrices; store hashed
    ledger for compliance.

## 6. Implementation Notes

- **Tech Stack**
  - Real-time components in Rust/TypeScript (for latency-sensitive layers),
    Python for research sandboxes, JAX for differentiable programming.
  - Use shared feature store with hybrid CPU/GPU/quantum accelerator
    abstraction.
- **Testing Strategy**
  - Backtest across at least 12 regimes, including synthetic crises.
  - Run adversarial stress tests (flash crashes, quote stuffing, regime flips).
  - Shadow-mode deployment before capital allocation.
- **Human Alignment**
  - Provide explainability dashboards: Shapley attributions for RL decisions,
    heatmaps for quantum amplitude shifts.
  - Maintain override controls with guaranteed latency < 250ms.

## 7. Roadmap Enhancements

1. **Cross-Asset Entanglement Hedging**
   - Extend amplitude encoding to capture joint crypto/FX/equity shocks.
2. **Meta-Learning Overlay**
   - Use MAML or RLÂ² to accelerate adaptation to new instruments.
3. **Ethical Guardrails**
   - Embed ESG constraint vectors into QUBO cost matrix; penalize hedges relying
     on restricted issuers.
4. **Social Learning Loop**
   - Integrate sentiment streams and human trader annotations into state vector.
