# Dynamic AI Dual-Core Architecture

## Overview

Dynamic AI (DAI) is modelled after a bi-hemisphere brain, coupling two
specialised large language models. The left hemisphere captures qualitative
context while the right hemisphere delivers quantitative precision. Together
they power the Dynamic Fusion Algo (DFA) and downstream trading stack.

## Cognitive Hemispheres

- **Grok-1 (Reasoning / Context)**
  - Runs the Dynamic Sentiment Algo (DSentA) and Dynamic News Algo (DNA).
  - Filters market noise, extracts macro narratives, and shapes directional
    bias.
  - Streams qualitative intuition to the core trading logic.
- **DeepSeek-v3 (Math / Logic)**
  - Executes the Dynamic Prediction Algo (DPA) and Dynamic Optimization Algo
    (DOA).
  - Handles backtesting, regression, probability weighting, and the Dynamic Risk
    Algo (DRA).
  - Quantifies statistical edges and risk-adjusted opportunities.

## Fusion & Execution Pathway

1. **Dynamic Fusion Algo (DFA)** merges Grok-1 intuition with DeepSeek-v3
   analytics to produce actionable signals.
2. **TradingView Integration** visualises DFA outputs, supports collaborative
   review, and enables rapid backtesting.
3. **Dynamic Trading Algo (DTA)** consumes validated signals and automates
   execution on Exness/MT5.
4. **Feedback Loop** pushes live performance metrics back into DAI for
   continuous calibration.

## Tokenomics Synchronisation

- **Dynamic Hormone Algo (DHA)** adjusts DCT token economics—yields, burns, and
  staking APR—in response to DAI outputs.
- Grok-1 insights adapt incentive flows to prevailing market regimes, e.g.,
  ramping rewards in bullish phases.
- DeepSeek-v3 forecasts enforce treasury safeguards and sustainability
  thresholds.

## Why the Dual-Core Matters

- Mirrors human cognition by blending narrative awareness with numerical rigour.
- Explains _why_ markets move while calculating _how_ to respond.
- Enhances adaptability by continuously harmonising qualitative and quantitative
  intelligence across trading and token systems.
