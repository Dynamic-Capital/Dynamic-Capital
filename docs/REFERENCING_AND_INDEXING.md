# Referencing and Indexing Overview

## What Is Referencing?

Referencing is the practice of acknowledging the sources that inform your work.
It ensures academic integrity, helps readers trace ideas back to their origins,
and demonstrates the breadth of research conducted.

### Major Referencing Styles

- **APA (American Psychological Association)** — Primarily used across the
  social sciences.
- **MLA (Modern Language Association)** — Common in humanities disciplines such
  as literature and languages.
- **Chicago / Turabian** — Offers both author-date and notes-bibliography
  systems, making it popular in history, arts, and some sciences.
- **Harvard** — A widely adopted author-date style spanning numerous fields.
- **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)** — Favored in
  engineering and computer science.
- **Vancouver** — A numbered system prevalent in medicine and the natural
  sciences.
- **OSCOLA (Oxford University Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities)** —
  Tailored to legal scholarship.

### Referencing Methods

- **In-text citations** — Include author-date pairs such as `(Smith, 2020)` or
  numbered references like `[1]` directly within the body of the text.
- **Footnotes and endnotes** — Employ superscript numerals that point to
  detailed references at the bottom of the page or the end of a chapter.
- **Bibliographies and reference lists** — Present a comprehensive list of all
  cited works, typically ordered alphabetically at the end of a document.

## What Is an Index?

An index is a navigational aid that directs readers to specific concepts, names,
or data within a body of work or data store.

### Index Types in Books and Documents

- **Subject index** — Organizes topics with corresponding page numbers.
- **Author index** — Lists the authors referenced or discussed.
- **Title index** — Collects titles of works, chapters, or sections.
- **Keyword index** — Highlights significant words or terms.
- **Back-of-the-book index** — A comprehensive index commonly placed at the end
  of books, often combining multiple index types.

### Index Types in Databases and Information Systems

- **Alphabetical index** — Sorts entries from A to Z for quick lookup.
- **Hierarchical index** — Structures topics from broad categories down to
  specific subtopics.
- **Concordance index** — Displays every occurrence of a particular word or
  phrase.
- **Citation index** — Tracks how often and where works are cited.
- **Database index (technical)** — Implements data structures such as B-trees,
  hash indexes, or inverted indexes to accelerate search performance.

## Quick Comparison

- **Referencing** focuses on crediting and locating external sources that inform
  the work.
- **Indexing** helps readers or systems locate information within the work
  itself or within a dataset.
