# Dynamic Chat Assistant Issue Resolution Plan

## Objectives
- Restore reliable status transitions for the Dynamic Capital AI assistant widget (`idle` → `syncing` → `connected` → `error`).
- Eliminate silent failures in history syncs and message sends.
- Provide clear fallbacks and observability so regressions surface quickly.

## Step-by-step Plan

### 1. Reproduce and document failures
- [ ] Capture console/network traces in staging and local builds while exercising:
  - [ ] Initial mount with/without prior history in `localStorage`.
  - [ ] Message send success and failure paths.
  - [ ] History fetch failure (simulate 5xx / timeout).
- [ ] Verify `syncStatus` transitions during each scenario and note mismatches between UI badges and actual state.
- [ ] Archive findings in an engineering notebook entry for traceability.

### 2. Fortify history bootstrap
- [ ] Update `useDynamicChat.fetchHistory` to surface fetch errors (reject promise with context).
- [ ] In `ChatAssistantWidget`, add `setSyncStatus("error")` when history sync fails, and show a toast so users understand why history is missing.
- [ ] Add integration test coverage that mocks a history failure and asserts the UI shows the reconnecting badge + fallback copy.

### 3. Harden message send pipeline
- [ ] Ensure `sendMessage` returns structured error objects (status code, request id) and log to an observability endpoint (e.g., Supabase log table or Sentry).
- [ ] In the widget, branch on known recoverable errors (validation, rate limit) vs. transport failures:
  - [ ] For recoverable issues, keep `syncStatus` at `idle` and display inline guidance.
  - [ ] For transport failures, reuse the fallback playbook and enter the `error` state.
- [ ] Add retry with exponential backoff for transient network errors before showing the fallback response.

### 4. Improve offline UX & recovery
- [ ] Persist the fallback assistant message separately so that once the connection is restored the UI can resume from the previous conversation instead of duplicating the fallback.
- [ ] Add a “Retry connection” CTA that triggers a history re-sync (sets `syncStatus` to `syncing` and calls `fetchHistory`).
- [ ] When a new assistant response arrives after an outage, automatically clear the `error` badge and toast a “Back online” confirmation.

### 5. Instrument & monitor
- [ ] Emit analytics events on each status change (`idle`, `syncing`, `connected`, `error`) with timestamps and session IDs.
- [ ] Dashboard the error-rate and average sync duration; set alerts when error-rate exceeds baseline.
- [ ] Establish a weekly regression review where the team inspects logs, open bugs, and user-reported issues.

### 6. Validation & rollout
- [ ] Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and targeted component/integration tests before merging.
- [ ] Ship to staging behind a feature flag; conduct smoke tests with the support desk.
- [ ] Roll out to production after 24 hours of stable telemetry; keep feature flag for rapid rollback.

## Exit Criteria
- [ ] Telemetry shows <1% error rate during message sends and history loads.
- [ ] Automated tests cover history failure, message send failure, and recovery paths.
- [ ] Support desk confirms fallback copy and retry controls behave as expected.
