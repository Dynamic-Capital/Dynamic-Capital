# Dynamic Capital Protocol Alignment Framework

## Purpose

This framework ensures every Dynamic Capital team and executive adheres to core
protocols while continuously improving operational outcomes. It establishes
shared expectations, accountability loops, and measurable success criteria for
protocol adoption.

## Guiding Objectives

1. **Consistent Adoption** – guarantee that portfolio, trading, product, and
   operations teams execute the same baseline protocols.
2. **Executive Stewardship** – make leadership the sponsor of protocol
   discipline, resourcing, and audits.
3. **Continuous Improvement** – embed retrospective feedback, telemetry, and
   experimentation into every protocol domain.

## Governance Structure

| Cadence   | Forum                       | Primary Focus                                                                                     | Participants                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Weekly    | Protocol Operations Standup | Review compliance dashboards, unblock execution gaps, and assign corrective tasks.                | Desk leads, product operations, compliance partner |
| Bi-weekly | Executive Protocol Review   | Validate KPI trends, approve resourcing, and ratify design changes.                               | CEO/COO, CTO, Head of Risk                         |
| Quarterly | Strategic Retrospective     | Compare protocol performance against strategic goals, prioritize automation and tooling upgrades. | Executive team, strategy & analytics               |

## Responsibilities

### Executives

- Champion protocol adherence in roadmap reviews, funding decisions, and
  quarterly OKRs.
- Sponsor tooling upgrades (Supabase schemas, Airflow automations,
  observability) required to keep protocols auditable.
- Approve exceptions through a documented waiver process with expiry dates and
  mitigation plans.

### Team Leads

- Map each protocol requirement to owned runbooks, automation clients, and squad
  rituals.
- Maintain freshness of protocol artifacts (risk controls, trading logic
  summaries, HR enablement) inside the shared registry.
- Escalate blockers via the weekly standup and supply corrective action plans
  within 48 hours.

### Individual Contributors

- Execute day-to-day tasks using the latest protocol snapshots surfaced by
  DynamicTeamRoleSyncAlgorithm.
- Record deviations, incidents, and lessons learned in the shared observability
  workspace.
- Participate in post-implementation reviews to validate improvements and update
  documentation.

## Adoption Playbook

1. **Baseline & Gap Analysis**
   - Inventory all existing protocols, owners, and cadence commitments.
   - Compare current execution data against required KPIs (telemetry coverage,
     incident response, HR readiness).
2. **Alignment Workshop Series**
   - Conduct cross-functional sessions to reconcile protocol overlaps and
     clarify accountability.
   - Publish a consolidated Protocol Alignment Charter summarizing
     responsibilities and escalation paths.
3. **Operationalization**
   - Integrate compliance checks into CI/CD pipelines, Supabase triggers, and
     automation DAGs.
   - Deploy dashboards that track adherence metrics and surface stale artifacts
     (>7 days old).
4. **Continuous Improvement Loop**
   - Schedule monthly mini-retrospectives for each protocol pillar (strategy,
     algorithm quality, HR enablement).
   - Log experiment results and incident learnings, feeding updates back into
     playbooks and training.

## Metrics & Reporting

- **Adherence Rate**: % of squads with up-to-date protocol records in Supabase
  (target ≥ 98%).
- **Exception Closure**: Average days to resolve protocol waivers or deviations
  (target ≤ 5 days).
- **Improvement Throughput**: Number of protocol enhancements accepted per
  quarter and lead time from proposal to deployment.
- **Incident Recovery**: Mean time to detect and remediate protocol-related
  incidents, validated through observability logs.

## Communication Channels

- Dedicated #protocol-ops Slack channel for daily coordination and alert
  routing.
- Monthly executive digest summarizing KPI performance, major risks, and planned
  interventions.
- Shared knowledge base linking runbooks, checklists, and protocol snapshots for
  easy discovery.

## Tooling Enhancements

- Expand Supabase metadata to capture protocol versioning, owners, and approval
  history.
- Automate freshness alerts via Airflow and integrate them with PagerDuty for
  critical breaches.
- Embed protocol compliance gates into automated testing suites and deployment
  pipelines.

## Success Criteria

The organization is considered aligned when:

1. All executives can cite protocol KPIs and corrective actions during reviews.
2. Teams execute with zero stale protocol artifacts and fully instrumented
   automation handoffs.
3. Improvement proposals flow seamlessly from retrospectives to backlog and
   delivery, with measurable impact on risk, performance, or efficiency.
4. Incident retrospectives consistently feed updates into protocol documentation
   within one sprint.
