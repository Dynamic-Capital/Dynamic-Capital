# Codex MCP Multi-Agent Workflow Guide

This guide documents how to orchestrate Codex CLI as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and coordinate it with the OpenAI Agents SDK to deliver deterministic, traceable software workflows. By following the steps below you can reproduce the end-to-end flow from the OpenAI Cookbook: launching the MCP server, running a single-agent build of a simple game, and expanding into a guarded multi-agent pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure the following tools and environment variables are available:

- **Codex CLI** installed locally so `npx codex` works.
- **Python 3.10+** and **pip** for running the Agents SDK.
- **Node.js 18+** (required for `npx`).
- An **OpenAI API key** stored in a `.env` file in your working directory.

Set up a clean workspace and save your key:

```bash
mkdir codex-workflows
cd codex-workflows
printf "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." > .env
```

## Install dependencies

Use a Python virtual environment to isolate the SDK dependencies, then install the required packages:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade openai openai-agents python-dotenv
```

## Initialize Codex CLI as an MCP server

Create `codex_mcp.py` with the boilerplate below to expose Codex CLI as a long-lived MCP server. The server keeps Codex alive across agent turns and surfaces the `codex()` and `codex-reply()` tools.

```python
import asyncio

from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio

async def main() -> None:
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        name="Codex CLI",
        params={
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "codex", "mcp"],
        },
        client_session_timeout_seconds=360000,
    ) as codex_mcp_server:
        print("Codex MCP server started.")
        # More logic coming in the next sections.
        return


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run the script once to verify the server launches:

```bash
python codex_mcp.py
```

You should see `Codex MCP server started.` before the script exits. The same MCP server setup is reused in the richer workflows below.

## Build a single-agent workflow

Enhance `codex_mcp.py` so a Designer agent writes a short game brief and a Developer agent implements the game via Codex MCP. The developer saves the finished HTML game to `index.html` in the current directory.

```python
import asyncio
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

from agents import Agent, Runner, set_default_openai_api
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio

load_dotenv(override=True)
set_default_openai_api(os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

async def main() -> None:
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        name="Codex CLI",
        params={
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "codex", "mcp"],
        },
        client_session_timeout_seconds=360000,
    ) as codex_mcp_server:
        developer_agent = Agent(
            name="Game Developer",
            instructions=(
                "You are an expert in building simple games using basic html + css + javascript with no dependencies. "
                "Save your work in a file called index.html in the current directory. "
                "Always call codex with \"approval-policy\": \"never\" and \"sandbox\": \"workspace-write\"."
            ),
            mcp_servers=[codex_mcp_server],
        )

        designer_agent = Agent(
            name="Game Designer",
            instructions=(
                "You are an indie game connoisseur. Come up with an idea for a single page html + css + javascript game that a developer could build in about 50 lines of code. "
                "Format your request as a 3 sentence design brief for a game developer and call the Game Developer coder with your idea."
            ),
            model="gpt-5",
            handoffs=[developer_agent],
        )

        await Runner.run(designer_agent, "Implement a fun new game!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Execute the workflow:

```bash
python codex_mcp.py
```

Codex will interpret the designer’s brief, create `index.html`, and write the complete browser game. Open the file in your browser to play the generated result.

## Expand to a multi-agent workflow

To scale into an auditable pipeline, add a project manager and specialized agents with scoped deliverables. Create `multi_agent_workflow.py` with the following code:

```python
import asyncio
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

from agents import (
    Agent,
    ModelSettings,
    Runner,
    WebSearchTool,
    set_default_openai_api,
)
from agents.extensions.handoff_prompt import RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio
from openai.types.shared import Reasoning

load_dotenv(override=True)
set_default_openai_api(os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

async def main() -> None:
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        name="Codex CLI",
        params={"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "codex", "mcp"]},
        client_session_timeout_seconds=360000,
    ) as codex_mcp_server:
        designer_agent = Agent(
            name="Designer",

                Objective:
                Convert the input task list into three project-root files the team will execute against.

                Deliverables (write in project root):
                - REQUIREMENTS.md: concise summary of product goals, target users, key features, and constraints.
                - TEST.md: tasks with [Owner] tags (Designer, Frontend, Backend, Tester) and clear acceptance criteria.
                - AGENT_TASKS.md: one section per role containing:
                  - Project name
                  - Required deliverables (exact file names and purpose)
                  - Key technical notes and constraints

                Process:
                - Resolve ambiguities with minimal, reasonable assumptions. Be specific so each role can act without guessing.
                - Create files using Codex MCP with {"approval-policy":"never","sandbox":"workspace-write"}.
                - Do not create folders. Only create REQUIREMENTS.md, TEST.md, AGENT_TASKS.md.

                Handoffs (gated by required files):
                1) After the three files above are created, hand off to the Designer with transfer_to_designer_agent and include REQUIREMENTS.md and AGENT_TASKS.md.
                2) Wait for the Designer to produce /design/design_spec.md. Verify that file exists before proceeding.
                3) When design_spec.md exists, hand off in parallel to both:
                   - Frontend Developer with transfer_to_frontend_developer_agent (provide design_spec.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, AGENT_TASKS.md).
                   - Backend Developer with transfer_to_backend_developer_agent (provide REQUIREMENTS.md, AGENT_TASKS.md).
                4) Wait for Frontend to produce /frontend/index.html and Backend to produce /backend/server.js. Verify both files exist.
                5) When both exist, hand off to the Tester with transfer_to_tester_agent and provide all prior artifacts and outputs.
                6) Do not advance to the next handoff until the required files for that step are present. If something is missing, request the owning agent to supply it and re-check.

                PM Responsibilities:
                - Coordinate all roles, track file completion, and enforce the above gating checks.
                - Do NOT respond with status updates. Just handoff to the next agent until the project is complete.

Goal: Build a tiny browser game to showcase a multi-agent workflow.

High-level requirements:
- Single-screen game called "Bug Busters".
- Player clicks a moving bug to earn points.
- Game ends after 20 seconds and shows final score.
- Optional: submit score to a simple backend and display a top-10 leaderboard.

Roles:
- Designer: create a one-page UI/UX spec and basic wireframe.
- Frontend Developer: implement the page and game logic.
- Backend Developer: implement a minimal API (GET /health, GET/POST /scores).
- Tester: write a quick test plan and a simple script to verify core routes.

Constraints:
- No external database—memory storage is fine.
- Keep everything readable for beginners; no frameworks required.
- All outputs should be small files saved in clearly named folders.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run the multi-agent workflow and inspect the generated artifacts:

```bash
python multi_agent_workflow.py
ls -R
```

The Project Manager writes `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `TEST.md`, and `AGENT_TASKS.md`, then coordinates each role. Designer, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, and Tester produce scoped outputs in their folders. The Project Manager only advances once the required files exist for each hand-off.

## Trace the workflow

Codex records detailed traces of every prompt, tool call, and hand-off. After the multi-agent run completes, open the Traces dashboard to inspect the execution timeline. You can drill into each step to review prompts, MCP interactions, generated files, and execution durations.

## Recap

By completing this guide you:

- exposed Codex CLI as an MCP server that persists across agent runs,
- built a deterministic single-agent workflow that ships a playable browser game, and
- orchestrated a multi-agent pipeline with gated hand-offs and traceability.

Use these patterns to expand Codex-driven workflows, add automation guardrails, or plug MCP-compatible tools into your broader delivery process.
