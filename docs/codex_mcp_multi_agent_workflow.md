# Codex MCP Multi-Agent Workflow Guide

This guide shows how to expose Codex CLI as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and orchestrate it with the OpenAI Agents SDK. You will:

1. Prepare a local environment with the required tooling.
2. Launch Codex CLI once as a long-lived MCP server to avoid restart overhead on back-to-back runs.
3. Build a focused single-agent workflow that ships a tiny browser game.
4. Grow the scenario into a guarded multi-agent pipeline and inspect its trace.

## 1. Prepare the environment

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Codex CLI** so that `npx codex` resolves.
- **Python 3.10+** and **pip** for the Agents SDK.
- **Node.js 18+** (needed by `npx`).
- An **OpenAI API key** stored locally.

Create a dedicated workspace and capture the API key inside a `.env` file:

```bash
mkdir codex-workflows
cd codex-workflows
printf "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." > .env
```

Set up and activate a Python virtual environment, then install the Agents SDK packages:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade openai openai-agents python-dotenv
```

## 2. Expose Codex CLI as an MCP server

Create `codex_mcp.py` with the boilerplate below. The script starts Codex CLI as an MCP server using stdio, keeps the process alive across agent turns, and is designed to stay warm for consecutive workflows.

```python
import asyncio

from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio


async def main() -> None:
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        name="Codex CLI",
        params={
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "codex", "mcp"],
        },
        client_session_timeout_seconds=360000,
    ) as codex_mcp_server:
        print("Codex MCP server started.")
        # The server stays open, so you can reuse it for back-to-back workflows.
        return


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Verify that the server launches cleanly:

```bash
python codex_mcp.py
```

The script prints `Codex MCP server started.` and exits, confirming the MCP server is ready to reuse in subsequent workflows without reinitializing Codex.

## 3. Ship a single-agent workflow

Extend `codex_mcp.py` so a designer agent writes a short brief and hands it to a developer agent that calls Codex MCP to implement the game. Both agents share the same long-lived MCP server, so repeated runs avoid start-up latency.

```python
import asyncio
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

from agents import Agent, Runner, set_default_openai_api
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio


load_dotenv(override=True)
set_default_openai_api(os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))


async def main() -> None:
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        name="Codex CLI",
        params={
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "codex", "mcp"],
        },
        client_session_timeout_seconds=360000,
    ) as codex_mcp_server:
        developer_agent = Agent(
            name="Game Developer",
            instructions=(
                "You are an expert in building simple games using basic html + css + javascript with no dependencies. "
                "Save your work in a file called index.html in the current directory. "
                "Always call codex with \"approval-policy\": \"never\" and \"sandbox\": \"workspace-write\"."
            ),
            mcp_servers=[codex_mcp_server],
        )

        designer_agent = Agent(
            name="Game Designer",
            instructions=(
                "You are an indie game connoisseur. Come up with an idea for a single page html + css + javascript game that a developer could build in about 50 lines of code. "
                "Format your request as a 3 sentence design brief for a game developer and call the Game Developer coder with your idea."
            ),
            model="gpt-5",
            handoffs=[developer_agent],
        )

        await Runner.run(designer_agent, "Implement a fun new game!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run the workflow:

```bash
python codex_mcp.py
```

Codex reads the designer’s brief, writes `index.html`, and produces a playable game. Because the MCP server stays active for the entire session, you can execute the script repeatedly without paying for fresh Codex start-ups each time.

## 4. Grow into a multi-agent pipeline

For a production-style workflow, create `multi_agent_workflow.py`. This script layers on a project manager and scoped specialist agents. The shared MCP server optimizes back-to-back hand-offs by eliminating reconnect overhead.

```python
import asyncio
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

from agents import (
    Agent,
    ModelSettings,
    Runner,
    WebSearchTool,
    set_default_openai_api,
)
from agents.extensions.handoff_prompt import RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio
from openai.types.shared import Reasoning


load_dotenv(override=True)
set_default_openai_api(os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))


async def main() -> None:
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        name="Codex CLI",
        params={"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "codex", "mcp"]},
        client_session_timeout_seconds=360000,
    ) as codex_mcp_server:
        designer_agent = Agent(
            name="Designer",
            instructions=(

                Objective:
                Convert the input task list into three project-root files the team will execute against.

                Deliverables (write in project root):
                - REQUIREMENTS.md: concise summary of product goals, target users, key features, and constraints.
                - TEST.md: tasks with [Owner] tags (Designer, Frontend, Backend, Tester) and clear acceptance criteria.
                - AGENT_TASKS.md: one section per role containing:
                  - Project name
                  - Required deliverables (exact file names and purpose)
                  - Key technical notes and constraints

                Process:
                - Resolve ambiguities with minimal, reasonable assumptions. Be specific so each role can act without guessing.
                - Create files using Codex MCP with {"approval-policy":"never","sandbox":"workspace-write"}.
                - Do not create folders. Only create REQUIREMENTS.md, TEST.md, AGENT_TASKS.md.

                Handoffs (gated by required files):
                1) After the three files above are created, hand off to the Designer with transfer_to_designer_agent and include REQUIREMENTS.md and AGENT_TASKS.md.
                2) Wait for the Designer to produce /design/design_spec.md. Verify that file exists before proceeding.
                3) When design_spec.md exists, hand off in parallel to both:
                   - Frontend Developer with transfer_to_frontend_developer_agent (provide design_spec.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, AGENT_TASKS.md).
                   - Backend Developer with transfer_to_backend_developer_agent (provide REQUIREMENTS.md, AGENT_TASKS.md).
                4) Wait for Frontend to produce /frontend/index.html and Backend to produce /backend/server.js. Verify both files exist.
                5) When both exist, hand off to the Tester with transfer_to_tester_agent and provide all prior artifacts and outputs.
                6) Do not advance to the next handoff until the required files for that step are present. If something is missing, request the owning agent to supply it and re-check.

                PM Responsibilities:
                - Coordinate all roles, track file completion, and enforce the above gating checks.
                - Do NOT respond with status updates. Just handoff to the next agent until the project is complete.

Goal: Build a tiny browser game to showcase a multi-agent workflow.

High-level requirements:
- Single-screen game called "Bug Busters".
- Player clicks a moving bug to earn points.
- Game ends after 20 seconds and shows final score.
- Optional: submit score to a simple backend and display a top-10 leaderboard.

Roles:
- Designer: create a one-page UI/UX spec and basic wireframe.
- Frontend Developer: implement the page and game logic.
- Backend Developer: implement a minimal API (GET /health, GET/POST /scores).
- Tester: write a quick test plan and a simple script to verify core routes.

Constraints:
- No external database—memory storage is fine.
- Keep everything readable for beginners; no frameworks required.
- All outputs should be small files saved in clearly named folders.

if __name__ == "__main__":

```

The project manager coordinates hand-offs, ensures prerequisites exist before progressing, and hands control back after each agent finishes.

## 5. Execute the pipeline and inspect artifacts

Run the workflow and list the generated files:

```bash
python multi_agent_workflow.py
ls -R
```

Expected outputs include:

- `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `TEST.md`, and `AGENT_TASKS.md` in the project root.
- `/design/design_spec.md` (and optional `wireframe.md`).
- `/frontend/index.html` with optional supporting assets.
- `/backend/server.js` plus `package.json` if requested.
- `/tests/TEST_PLAN.md` and any automation scripts.

Because the MCP server stays open for the entire run, sequential role hand-offs incur minimal overhead, keeping back-to-back agent invocations snappy.

## 6. Trace the workflow

Codex automatically records traces that capture prompts, tool calls, file writes, and hand-offs. After the multi-agent run completes, open the Traces dashboard to review the execution timeline and drill into any step for auditability or debugging insights.

## 7. Next steps

- Expand the pipeline with additional roles, guardrails, or integration tests.
- Swap Codex MCP for another MCP-compatible tool to explore hybrid workflows.
- Parameterize the task list so you can queue multiple projects back-to-back without restarting the MCP server.
