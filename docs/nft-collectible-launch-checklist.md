# NFT Collectible Launch Checklist

This checklist distills the ingredients of successful NFT collections into
actionable tasks. Use it to orchestrate concept development, metadata
engineering, community activation, and post-mint support so each collectible
feels unique while belonging to a cohesive universe.

## 1. Concept Foundations

- [ ] Document the project vision, target audience, and long-term roadmap.
- [ ] Define the thematic pillars (e.g., sci-fi heist crew, digital botanicals)
      that will anchor every asset and narrative beat.
- [ ] Map competitive projects to identify whitespace and inspiration without
      duplicating existing IP.
- [ ] Align the core team (art, engineering, marketing, community) on shared
      definitions of success and delivery milestones.

## 2. Trait System & Metadata Architecture

- [ ] Draft an attribute taxonomy covering base character/body, backgrounds,
      apparel, expressions, accessories, and any special overlays.
- [ ] Assign rarity weights for each trait layer and calculate projected
      distribution curves to surface grails without breaking cohesion.
- [ ] Build the metadata schema (JSON structure, naming conventions, token
      descriptions) and validate against marketplace requirements (OpenSea,
      Blur, Magic Eden, etc.).
- [ ] Prototype the generative pipeline to ensure layer compatibility, collision
      avoidance, and deterministic asset naming.
- [ ] Run quality assurance on test mints, confirming metadata renders correctly
      across wallets, marketplaces, and internal dashboards.

## 3. Narrative & Worldbuilding

- [ ] Write the origin story, lore timeline, and key characters that give
      holders a world to explore.
- [ ] Produce canonical references (world map, relationship charts, factions) to
      keep contributors aligned.
- [ ] Plan episodic content releases—blogs, audio logs, livestreams—that extend
      the story pre- and post-mint.
- [ ] Draft community prompts and interactive beats (e.g.,
      choose-your-own-adventure votes) that reinforce the lore.

## 4. Utility & Holder Benefits

- [ ] Enumerate token-gated perks (events, governance, merch drops, partner
      integrations) and map them to delivery timelines.
- [ ] Validate feasibility and costs for each utility with engineering,
      operations, and finance stakeholders.
- [ ] Outline smart contract hooks or off-chain systems required to deliver the
      promised perks.
- [ ] Review compliance, terms of service, and regional regulations for any
      revenue sharing or prize-based mechanics.
- [ ] Publish a transparent roadmap with milestone statuses so holders can track
      benefit fulfillment.

## 5. Community & Brand Activation

- [ ] Secure domains, social handles, and communication channels (Discord,
      Telegram, X, email marketing).
- [ ] Develop brand guidelines covering logo usage, tone of voice, typography,
      color palettes, and motion language.
- [ ] Recruit and train moderators/ambassadors with escalation procedures and
      community health metrics.
- [ ] Plan announcement cadence, collaborations, and AMAs to drive momentum
      before, during, and after mint.
- [ ] Implement community analytics to monitor engagement, sentiment, and
      retention.

## 6. Supply Strategy & Mint Mechanics

- [ ] Lock the total supply, edition tiers (1/1s, rares, commons), and any
      future expansion policy.
- [ ] Design mint phases (allowlist, public, Dutch auction, free claim) with
      clear eligibility rules and timelines.
- [ ] Engineer mint contracts for transparency, on-chain provenance, and gas
      optimization; commission a security audit.
- [ ] Stress-test mint flows (including bot mitigation and wallet UX) on
      testnets or staging environments.
- [ ] Prepare contingency plans for mint pauses, contract upgrades, and
      emergency communications.

## 7. Visual Direction & Asset Production

- [ ] Craft a visual bible (mood boards, lighting references, rendering specs)
      to maintain a signature art style.
- [ ] Establish file management conventions, version control, and backup
      strategies for raw art assets.
- [ ] Iterate on sample collectibles to validate style across the rarity
      spectrum and confirm accessibility contrast ratios.
- [ ] Automate export pipelines for final PNG/GLB files, metadata bundling, and
      IPFS/Arweave uploads.
- [ ] Create marketing collateral templates (teasers, trait reveals, motion
      snippets) aligned with the art direction.

## 8. Launch Operations & Post-Mint Stewardship

- [ ] Set up real-time dashboards for mint metrics, secondary market
      performance, and holder distribution.
- [ ] Schedule post-mint communications (wrap-up thread, collector highlights,
      next-step announcements).
- [ ] Outline governance or voting mechanics if holders influence roadmap
      decisions.
- [ ] Plan ongoing utility drops, seasonal events, or trait evolutions to keep
      the collection vibrant.
- [ ] Capture retrospectives and holder feedback to iterate on future drops or
      expansions.

## Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Integrate dynamic metadata or evolving artwork that reacts to on-chain or
      community milestones.
- [ ] Offer interoperability bridges (metaverse avatars, game integrations) to
      extend collectible utility.
- [ ] Produce physical collectibles or merch bundles for top-tier holders with
      fulfillment logistics documented.
- [ ] Implement loyalty scoring to recognize long-term holders versus flippers.
