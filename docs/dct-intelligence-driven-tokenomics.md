# Dynamic Capital Token (DCT) Intelligence-Driven Tokenomics

## Overview

Dynamic Capital Token (DCT) introduces feedback loops between protocol
intelligence, service performance, and token supply mechanics. The architecture
below formalizes how gains in artificial general intelligence (AGI) or network
revenue translate into on-chain token flows.

## 1. Intelligence-Linked Burning Algorithm

The burn module retires DCT whenever the protocol's AGI achieves measurable
gains.

- **Formula**: $B = \lambda \cdot \Delta I$
- **Variables**:
  - $B$: total DCT to burn for the epoch
  - $\Delta I$: intelligence delta derived from model evaluations, user
    sentiment, or trading accuracy
  - $\lambda$: governance-defined burn coefficient that scales sensitivity to
    intelligence changes
- **Trigger Events**:
  - Production deployment of improved AGI models
  - Completion of mentorship or training milestones that increase composite
    intelligence scores
  - Positive user feedback loops or benchmark uplifts recorded by monitoring
    oracles
- **Process Flow**:
  1. Intelligence oracle aggregates metrics and calculates $\Delta I$.
  2. Governance contract provides the current $\lambda$ parameter.
  3. Burn executor retires $B$ DCT from treasury or supply, emitting events for
     transparency.

## 2. Revenue-Driven Buyback Algorithm

Protocol revenues are recycled into DCT to reinforce price support and reward
productive contributors. The treasury budget is pre-configured at a 48/32/20
split between operating liquidity, compounding auto-invest flows, and direct
buyback-and-burn, with governance-locked bounds that keep proposals within a
38–58% operating band, 25–40% reinvestment band, and 15–30% burn band.

- **Formula**: $BB = \phi \cdot R$
- **Variables**:
  - $BB$: total DCT purchased via buyback
  - $R$: net revenue from subscriptions, strategy fees, or liquidity pool
    spreads
  - $\phi$: buyback ratio adjustable through governance votes
- **Execution Cycle**:
  1. Revenue router batches net inflows per epoch.
  2. Treasury contract calculates the buyback budget $BB$.
  3. Automated market operations acquire DCT from designated DEX pools.
  4. Purchased tokens are redistributed to staking vaults, mentorship rewards,
     or AGI training bounties as configured.
  5. Dynamic adjustments boost buyback budgets by up to 300 bps per epoch when
     revenue surges beyond 180,000 TON or when intelligence delta momentum
     exceeds the 1.15 threshold.

## 3. Market Maker Coordination Algorithm

A liquidity coordination layer synchronizes service pricing with market dynamics
while buffering volatility.

- **Formula**: $P_s = \frac{P_{avg} + \sigma}{n}$
- **Variables**:
  - $P_s$: adjusted service price for a given product line
  - $P_{avg}$: volume-weighted average DCT price across venues
  - $\sigma$: volatility buffer derived from on-chain order book variance
  - $n$: number of active services requiring synchronized pricing
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Maintain target spreads and depth across mentorship, signals, and pooled
    strategies.
  - Dynamically rebalance liquidity using treasury reserves when volatility
    spikes.
  - Signal pricing updates to downstream service modules to keep UX consistent.

## 4. Synced Pricing Engine

A unified oracle layer translates live DCT valuations into service access costs.

- **Mechanism**:
  1. Oracle fetches DCT price feeds from TON-native data sources.
  2. Pricing engine refreshes service tariffs on a block cadence or on-demand
     triggers.
  3. Discount or boost factors are applied based on AGI performance tiers or
     user status.
  4. Updated prices propagate to mentorship, VIP signals, education, and trading
     pools.

## Intelligence-Driven Tokenomics Matrix

| Component          | Linked Behavior                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AGI Growth         | Triggers DCT burn and elevates perceived service value                |
| Mentorship Success | Unlocks staking rewards and increases aggregated intelligence scores  |
| Trading Accuracy   | Improves $\Delta I$ inputs and refines market making heuristics       |
| User Engagement    | Scales revenue $R$, driving higher buyback volumes and token velocity |

## Treasury & Staking Configuration

- **Liquidity Split Guardrails**: Default treasury routing applies 48% to
  operations, 32% to auto-invest vaults, and 20% to buyback-and-burn activity.
  Governance-defined bounds enforce gradual rebalancing and block extreme swings
  outside the 38–58% / 25–40% / 15–30% envelopes.
- **Adaptive Budget Boosts**: Revenue surges above 180,000 TON or sustained
  intelligence momentum ($\Delta I > 1.15$) increment buyback budgets by up to
  300 bps while protecting a 15,000 TON floor so downside phases continue to be
  supported.
- **Staking Tiers**: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and newly added Platinum locks (3, 6,
  12, and 18 months) deliver 1.2x, 1.5x, 2.0x, and 2.5x multipliers respectively
  with an additional 75 bps loyalty kicker for restaked positions.
- **Emission Controls**: Weekly epochs remain capped at 240,000 DCT with a 4.5%
  annualized inflation target, 150 bps decay factor, and a 60,000 DCT floor to
  keep contributor rewards predictable even during contraction cycles.

## Governance Considerations

- **Parameter Management**: $\lambda$ and $\phi$ should support time-weighted
  adjustments to smooth sudden metric swings.
- **Transparency**: Publish burn and buyback events with metric snapshots so
  stakeholders can audit the intelligence-to-tokenomics linkage.
- **Fail Safes**: Introduce guardrails that cap $B$ and $BB$ per epoch to avoid
  treasury depletion during anomalous data spikes.
- **Review Cadence**: Conduct quarterly parameter reviews that incorporate AGI
  roadmap progress, liquidity health, and community feedback.

## Integration Checklist

- Define canonical data schemas for intelligence metrics, revenue streams, and
  service inventories.
- Connect monitoring pipelines that feed oracle updates to the burn and buyback
  executors.
- Implement simulation tooling to stress test parameter changes before
  governance proposals go live.
- Provide dashboards that visualize intelligence deltas, burn history, buyback
  cadence, and service price adjustments.
