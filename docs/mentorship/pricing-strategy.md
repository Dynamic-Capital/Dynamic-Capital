# Dynamic Capital Mentorship Pricing Strategy

## Positioning Overview

- **Experience leverage**: You bring nine years of trading experience
  (2016–2025), which positions you as a senior mentor relative to most retail
  educators. Emphasize verified results, long-term consistency, and student
  testimonials to justify premium pricing.
- **Program structure**: Four-week intensive curriculum plus graduation week and
  bonus resources. Includes Telegram community access, personal feedback, and
  optional calls.
- **Value stack**: Education (videos, PDFs), coaching (feedback, reviews),
  community (daily Telegram touchpoints), and tools (templates, checklists,
  bonuses).

  trading communities.

   Day 10 trade breakdown, Day 14 setups, Day 18 mock challenge).
3. Prepare Stripe/LemonSqueezy checkout links with payment plan variants.
4. Build simple Notion dashboard to track cohort metrics and testimonial
   requests.
