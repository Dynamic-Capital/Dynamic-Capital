# Dynamic Mentorship – July 2025 Cohort Overview

## Program Vision

- Four-week intensive led by Mumin (Founder, Dynamic Capital) focused on
  clarity, confidence, and consistency in discretionary trading.
- Core curriculum builds from market structure foundations to execution,
  psychology, and journaling habits.
- Participants are expected to engage daily, maintain clean charts, and document
  their learning process.

## Weekly Themes

1. **Week 1 – Market Basics & Structure**
   - Trending versus ranging conditions, candlestick behavior, and clean chart
     setup.
   - Building market structure literacy: HH/HL, LL/LH, BOS versus ChoCh, and
     timeframe context.
2. **Week 2 – Zones & Entry Triggers**
   - Liquidity concepts, supply and demand mapping, order blocks, breaker
     blocks, and entry confirmations.
   - Homework emphasizing structured trade ideas with bias, zone logic, and risk
     parameters.
3. **Week 3 – Strategy & Routine**
   - Consolidation, breakout, trending, and reversal playbooks.
   - Translating higher timeframe bias into lower timeframe execution.
4. **Week 4 – Psychology & Journaling**
   - Performance mindset, gradual risk scaling, and maintaining balance outside
     of charts.
   - Reinforcing consistency through reflective practice and trade journaling.

## Daily Operating Rhythm

- Lessons release Monday through Friday, combining written modules, screenshots,
  and voice notes.
- Homework distributed on Fridays with individualized feedback delivered via
  voice or text.
- Group chat remains the hub for questions, chart markups, and collaborative
  breakdowns—professional etiquette is required.

## Initial Onboarding Checklist

- Share a personal introduction: name, location, trading experience, and key
  improvement goal.
- Prepare tooling: TradingView account (free or paid) and a trade journal in
  notebook, Notion, or spreadsheet form.

## Automation & Sync Strategy

- **Source of truth hub:** Maintain a single shared workspace (e.g., Notion or
  Supabase table) where lesson assets, voice notes, and TradingView links are
  logged with timestamps and access levels. Mirror this data into the community
  channel via scheduled posts or webhook automations so late-joining mentees
  receive the full archive instantly.
- **Auto-publish cadence:** Use a scheduler (Zapier, n8n, or Supabase Edge
  Functions) to push daily reminders, homework prompts, and resource drops at
  9:00 local cohort time. The scheduler should reference the source-of-truth hub
  to avoid manual duplication.
- **Version tagging:** Tag each upload with cohort, week, and lesson IDs (e.g.,
  `2025-07-W2-D6`) so historical content can be resurfaced programmatically and
  reused for future cohorts with minimal editing.
- **TradingView sync:** Capture snapshot URLs plus `.tv` script exports and
  store them alongside contextual notes. Automate link validation weekly to
  ensure expired or updated charts trigger alerts for replacement.

## Future-Proofing Playbook

- **Reusable templates:** Standardize welcome packs, homework briefs, and
  feedback forms as modular templates. Update templates quarterly and propagate
  changes automatically through the scheduler to keep messaging current.
- **Curriculum diff reviews:** At the close of each cohort, run a retrospective
  that diffs planned lessons against delivered materials. Log discoveries in the
  source-of-truth hub and queue high-impact improvements for the next cycle.
- **Dynamic cohort settings:** Parameterize variables such as trading focus
  pairs, market sessions, and risk modules so the automation layer can adjust
  announcements when the mentorship scope evolves.
- **Continuity backups:** Export weekly archives (PDF bundles + CSV metadata) to
  redundant storage (cloud drive + repository) to guard against platform outages
  and preserve institutional knowledge.

## Self-Learning Feedback Loop

- **Daily sentiment pulse:** Automate end-of-day micro-surveys capturing
  clarity, confidence, and outstanding questions. Aggregate responses into
  dashboards that highlight cohorts needing intervention.
- **Performance telemetry:** Integrate journaling tools with Google Sheets or
  Supabase to ingest trade metrics (win rate, RR, adherence). Feed summaries
  back into the community on Mondays to reinforce data-driven growth.
- **Adaptive content nudges:** Trigger supplemental lessons when telemetry shows
  specific gaps (e.g., risk breaches or mis-identified structure). The
  automation layer should recommend targeted replays or office hours.
- **Mentor review sprints:** Schedule weekly mentor syncs with AI-assisted
  summarization of chat highlights, survey data, and trade outcomes so
  facilitators can iterate on delivery in near real-time.

## Mindset Pillars

- **Consistency over intensity:** Small, repeatable improvements beat sporadic
  effort.
- **Process fidelity:** Validate setups by plan adherence, risk management, and
  adaptability rather than outcome alone.
- **Community engagement:** Sharing charts and questions accelerates clarity;
  feedback loops are daily.
- **Balanced growth:** Protect mental bandwidth by stepping away when needed and
  cultivating interests beyond trading.

## Reference Materials Catalog

- Market basics, structure frameworks, and trading psychology notes.
- Liquidity, institutional trading guides, and manipulation breakdowns.
- Supply and demand mapping frameworks, zone creation workflows, and entry
  models.
- Risk and reward calculators, journaling templates, and ICT terminology cheat
  sheets.

Use this overview to onboard new cohort members quickly, align weekly study
plans, and centralize the July 2025 resource stack.
