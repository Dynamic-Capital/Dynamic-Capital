# Dynamic Capital Privacy Notice

_Last updated: March 2025_

Dynamic Capital values the privacy of every client, partner, and visitor who
interacts with our products, services, and marketing channels. This Privacy
Notice explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal data. It
also outlines the rights available to individuals under applicable privacy laws
in the jurisdictions where we operate.

## 1. Scope

This Privacy Notice applies to:

- The Dynamic Capital web properties, including logged-in dashboards and public
  marketing pages.
- Mobile, desktop, and API clients that integrate with the Dynamic Capital
  platform.
- Communications and support interactions across email, chat, voice, or in-
  product messaging.
- Prospective customers who engage with events, webinars, or marketing
  campaigns.

Internal human resources processing for employees and contractors is covered by
separate workforce privacy documentation available through the People Operations
portal.

## 2. Data We Collect

We collect personal data in the following categories:

- **Account and contact details:** Names, email addresses, company affiliation,
  postal addresses, telephone numbers, and authentication credentials provided
  during registration or onboarding.
- **Financial profile information:** Know-your-customer (KYC) data, beneficial
  ownership attestations, risk assessments, and sanctions screening results when
  required for regulatory compliance.
- **Usage and telemetry data:** Device information, IP addresses, browser type,
  access logs, feature usage metrics, clickstream data, and error diagnostics to
  maintain platform reliability.
- **AI training and feedback signals:** Prompts, responses, or annotations you
  submit to Dynamic Capital models. We apply automated and manual review to
  improve quality and safety while minimising the inclusion of personal data.
- **Communications:** Support tickets, call recordings (with notice), feedback,
  surveys, and other correspondence with our teams.
- **Marketing preferences:** Newsletter opt-ins, campaign responses, referral
  information, and event participation history.

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16. If
we learn that such data has been provided, we will delete it and take steps to
prevent future collection.

## 3. How We Use Personal Data

Dynamic Capital processes personal data for legitimate business purposes,
including to:

1. Provide, operate, and improve our products and services.
2. Verify identity, manage customer due diligence, and satisfy regulatory
   obligations.
3. Deliver personalised content, product recommendations, and marketing
   communications based on consent or applicable law.
4. Detect, investigate, and prevent fraud, abuse, or security incidents.
5. Respond to inquiries, provide customer support, and fulfil contractual
   commitments.
6. Perform analytics, conduct research, and develop new features, including the
   training and evaluation of AI systems subject to appropriate safeguards.
7. Comply with legal obligations, enforce agreements, and protect the rights of
   Dynamic Capital and our users.

We rely on different legal bases for processing, including performance of a
contract, legitimate interests, compliance with legal obligations, and consent
where required.

## 4. Sharing and Disclosure

We share personal data with:

- **Service providers:** Cloud hosting, analytics, communications, payment,
  identity verification, and security vendors that process data on our behalf
  under written agreements.
- **Regulators and legal authorities:** When required by law, subpoena, or legal
  process, or to protect our rights and the safety of others.
- **Corporate transactions:** Potential buyers, advisors, or counterparties in
  the context of mergers, acquisitions, financing, or restructuring events. Any
  transfer of personal data remains subject to this Privacy Notice or an updated
  notice that provides equivalent protection.
- **Group companies:** Affiliates and subsidiaries that support operations,
  subject to intra-group data protection agreements.

Dynamic Capital does not sell personal data or share it with third parties for
cross-context behavioural advertising without consent. We honour browser-based
opt-out signals such as Global Privacy Control where legally required.

## 5. International Data Transfers

Personal data may be transferred to countries outside of the jurisdiction in
which it was collected. When we transfer data internationally, we rely on
adequate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses, intra-group data
transfer agreements, or certifications recognised by applicable law (including
participation in the EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework where relevant).

## 6. Data Retention

We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined
in this Privacy Notice, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
enforce agreements. Retention schedules are reviewed annually and aligned with
regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate. When retention
periods expire, data is securely deleted or anonymised.

## 7. Individual Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- Access, correct, or delete personal data we hold about you.
- Object to or restrict certain processing activities, including automated
  decision-making.
- Receive a portable copy of your data.
- Opt out of marketing communications or withdraw consent when processing is
  based on consent.
- Appeal adverse decisions where required by state privacy laws in the United
  States.

`privacy@dynamic.capital`. We verify identity before fulfilling requests and aim
to respond within one month or the timeframe required by law. If you are located
in the European Economic Area, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with
your local supervisory authority.

## 8. Security

We implement technical and organisational measures to safeguard personal data,
including encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, least-privilege
principles, continuous monitoring, and regular security assessments. Incident
response procedures ensure that suspected breaches are investigated promptly and
reported to authorities and affected individuals when required.

## 9. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We use cookies, pixels, and similar technologies to operate our sites, measure
performance, and tailor experiences. Detailed information about these tools and
choices for managing preferences is available in the

## 10. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling

Certain features leverage automated decision-making, such as risk scoring or AI-
driven recommendations. Humans review high-impact outcomes, and individuals may
request additional information about the logic involved or opt out where
required by law.
