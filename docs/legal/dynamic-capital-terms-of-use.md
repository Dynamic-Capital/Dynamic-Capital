(collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to
be bound by these Terms and any policies referenced herein. If you do not agree,
do not use the Services.

## 1. Eligibility and Account Registration

- You must be at least 18 years old and capable of entering into legally binding
  agreements to use the Services.
- Account registration requires providing accurate, complete, and up-to-date
  information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
  credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
- Dynamic Capital reserves the right to decline, suspend, or terminate accounts
  if information is inaccurate, fraudulent, or violates these Terms.
- If you are registering on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you
  have authority to bind that entity to these Terms.

## 2. Permitted Use and Restrictions

- The Services may be used only for lawful purposes and in accordance with all
  applicable laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.
- You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, or create derivative
  works of the Services except as expressly permitted in writing by Dynamic
  Capital.
- Automated access (such as bots or scripts) is permitted solely through
  documented APIs and in compliance with any rate limits or usage restrictions.
- You must not upload malicious code, attempt to circumvent security controls,
  or interfere with system integrity.
- The [Acceptable Use Policy](dynamic-capital-acceptable-use-policy.md) provides
  additional restrictions that form part of these Terms.

## 3. Subscription Plans and Payment

- Fees, billing cycles, and payment methods are described in the applicable
  order form or subscription agreement. Unless stated otherwise, plans renew
  automatically at the end of each term.
- You authorise Dynamic Capital or its payment processors to charge all
  applicable fees using the payment method on file. Late payments may incur
  interest or suspension of service.
- Except where prohibited by law, fees are non-refundable. Certain plans may
  include trial periods or service-level guarantees described in separate terms.
- Taxes, duties, or similar charges are your responsibility unless we state
  otherwise in writing.

## 4. Intellectual Property

- All software, documentation, logos, and content made available through the
  Services are owned by Dynamic Capital or its licensors and are protected by

- Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Dynamic Capital grants a limited,
  non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the Services for your internal
  business purposes.
- Feedback or suggestions provided to Dynamic Capital may be used without
  restriction, compensation, or obligation.

## 5. Confidentiality

- Certain areas of the Services may expose confidential information, including
  research, trading strategies, product roadmaps, or non-public metrics.
- You agree to protect confidential information with the same level of care used
  for your own sensitive information and to use it solely as permitted by these
  Terms or applicable agreements.
- If disclosure is required by law, you must provide prompt notice (where
  legally permissible) so Dynamic Capital can seek protective measures.

## 6. Compliance Obligations

- You are responsible for meeting any regulatory requirements associated with
  your use of the Services, including financial, tax, data protection, export
  control, and reporting obligations.
- Dynamic Capital may require additional information or documentation to fulfil
  compliance obligations such as KYC/AML checks or sanctions screening.
- You must not use the Services if doing so would violate applicable law or
  cause Dynamic Capital to breach regulatory restrictions, including those
  related to embargoed countries or prohibited counterparties.

## 7. Third-Party Services

- The Services may integrate with or reference third-party products. Third-party
  terms and privacy notices apply to your use of those products.
- Dynamic Capital is not responsible for third-party services, and the inclusion
  of integrations does not constitute an endorsement.
- Access to third-party data sources may be subject to additional fees or usage
  limits imposed by the provider.

## 8. Service Availability and Support

- Dynamic Capital aims to provide continuous access to the Services but does not
  guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.
- Scheduled maintenance or updates may temporarily affect availability. Dynamic
  Capital will provide reasonable notice of planned downtime when practicable.
- Support services, response times, and service-level objectives are defined in
  the applicable support plan or customer agreement.
- Beta or experimental features are provided “as is” and may be modified or
  discontinued at any time without notice.

## 9. AI-Generated Output and Data Use

- Some Services incorporate machine learning or generative AI features. Output
  may be inaccurate or incomplete. You are responsible for independently
  verifying results before relying on them.
- Unless otherwise agreed, Dynamic Capital may use de-identified telemetry and
  feedback data to improve models, subject to the
  [Privacy Notice](dynamic-capital-privacy-notice.md).
- You must not use AI features to generate unlawful content, infringe third-
  party rights, or mislead others about the provenance of generated material.

## 10. Disclaimers

- The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without
  warranties of any kind, express or implied, including warranties of
  merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
- Dynamic Capital does not provide investment, legal, or tax advice. Any
  financial information or market data is for informational purposes only and
  should not be construed as a recommendation.
- We do not guarantee that the Services will meet performance benchmarks or
  achieve particular results.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

- To the maximum extent permitted by law, Dynamic Capital is not liable for any
  indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss
  of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill arising from or related to your use of
  the Services.
- Dynamic Capital’s aggregate liability for claims under these Terms is limited
  to the greater of (a) fees paid by you in the twelve months preceding the
  claim or (b) one hundred U.S. dollars (USD $100).
- These limitations do not apply to liability for fraud, wilful misconduct, or
  death or personal injury caused by negligence where such exclusions are not
  permitted by law.

## 12. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Dynamic Capital, its officers,
directors, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses,
and expenses (including legal fees) arising out of or related to your use of the
Services, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third-party rights.

## 13. Termination

- Either party may terminate access to the Services upon written notice if the
  other party materially breaches these Terms and fails to cure within thirty
  days.
- Dynamic Capital may suspend or terminate access immediately in response to
  security threats, suspected fraud, legal requests, or misuse of the Services.
- Upon termination, all rights granted to you under these Terms cease, and you
  must discontinue use of the Services. Sections intended to survive termination
  (including intellectual property, confidentiality, disclaimers, limitation of
  liability, and indemnification) remain in effect.
- Following termination, Dynamic Capital will make account data available for
  export for thirty days unless prohibited by law or agreement.

## 14. Modifications

Dynamic Capital may update these Terms from time to time. Changes become
effective upon posting to the Services or other communication method identified
at the time of update. Continued use of the Services after changes take effect
constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. Material changes will be announced
at least thirty days in advance when feasible.

## 15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

- These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
  to conflict of law principles.
- Disputes will first be addressed through good-faith negotiations between the
  parties. If unresolved within thirty days, disputes will be submitted to
  binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in
  Wilmington, Delaware, unless another venue is required by applicable law.
- Nothing in this section prevents either party from seeking injunctive or other
  equitable relief in court to protect intellectual property or confidential
  information.
