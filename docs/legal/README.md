# Licensing Overview

Dynamic Capital retains all rights to the source code and assets in this
repository. The proprietary license is documented in the root-level `LICENSE`
file. This directory collects references for components that ship under separate
third-party licenses so downstream teams can perform due diligence and maintain
attribution when integrating the Dynamic Capital stack.

- [`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md) enumerates the primary
  open-source libraries bundled with the application along with links to their
  canonical license texts.
- Compliance attestations and governance documents live under
  [`../compliance`](../compliance). Refer to the machine-readable certificate
  inventory (`certificates.json`) when verifying renewal dates or automating
  vendor assessments.

Questions about commercial licensing or redistribution should be directed to
`legal@dynamic.capital`.
