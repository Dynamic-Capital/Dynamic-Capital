# General Risk Warning

The information, analytics, and tools provided by Dynamic Capital are intended
for sophisticated users who understand the risks associated with digital assets,
financial markets, algorithmic strategies, and AI-assisted decision-making. This
General Risk Warning highlights key considerations and limitations. It does not
replace independent professional advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

## Market and Investment Risk

- Digital assets and other alternative investments are highly volatile and may
  experience rapid price movements or complete loss of value.
- Past performance, backtests, or simulated results generated through Dynamic
  Capital tools do not guarantee future outcomes.
- Liquidity constraints, market gaps, and counterparty failures can prevent
  execution at expected prices or cause significant slippage.
- Stablecoins, tokenised assets, and structured products are subject to issuer
  risk, redemption limitations, and regulatory intervention that may impair
  value.

## Regulatory and Legal Risk

- Regulatory frameworks for digital assets continue to evolve. Jurisdictional
  changes may restrict access to certain products, impose new compliance
  obligations, or require divestment.
- Users are responsible for ensuring their activities comply with applicable
  laws, including securities, derivatives, commodities, tax, and data protection
  regulations.
- Dynamic Capital does not represent that any particular strategy or product is
  authorised in your jurisdiction. You must consult local counsel or regulators
  where necessary.
- AI governance requirements, including model transparency and explainability
  obligations under the EU AI Act and similar regimes, may affect how you deploy
  analytics derived from the Services.

## Technology and Operational Risk

- Trading systems, APIs, and infrastructure may experience outages, latency, or
  unexpected behaviour due to software defects, cyberattacks, or third-party
  service disruptions.
- Automated strategies can generate unintended orders or positions if
  configurations are incorrect or market conditions change rapidly. Implement
  appropriate safeguards, such as circuit breakers and manual overrides.
- Users are responsible for maintaining secure access controls, protecting API
  keys, and monitoring their accounts for unauthorised activity.
- AI-generated insights may contain hallucinations, bias, or outdated market
  information. Independent verification is essential before executing trades or
  making financial commitments.

## Counterparty and Custodial Risk

- Storing assets with third-party custodians or trading venues introduces risk
  of insolvency, security breaches, or operational failures at those
  institutions.
- Conduct independent due diligence on counterparties and understand the terms
  of custody, including segregation of assets, insurance coverage, and recovery
  procedures.
- Lending, staking, or yield-enhancing programmes may be subject to recall
  rights, lock-up periods, or clawbacks in insolvency proceedings.

## Leverage and Derivatives Risk

- Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Small market moves can trigger
  margin calls, forced liquidations, or negative account balances.
- Complex derivatives, structured products, or perpetual swaps may involve
  embedded risks such as funding rate fluctuations, basis risk, or mandatory
  settlement events.
- Default by a clearing broker or liquidity provider can cascade through
  correlated positions, resulting in unexpected losses.

## No Personalised Advice

Dynamic Capital provides general information, analytics, and infrastructure. We
are not acting as an investment adviser, broker, fiduciary, or tax advisor for
any user. You should consult qualified professionals before making investment or
trading decisions.

## User Responsibilities

- Evaluate your financial objectives, experience, and risk tolerance before
  using Dynamic Capital tools.
- Test strategies in simulated or sandbox environments prior to deploying live
  capital.
- Maintain appropriate capital reserves and risk controls to withstand adverse
  market movements.
- Monitor regulatory developments that may affect your ability to operate or
  hold certain assets.
