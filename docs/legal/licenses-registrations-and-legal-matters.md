# Licenses, Registrations, and Other Legal Matters

_Last reviewed: March 2025_

Dynamic Capital maintains a proactive compliance posture designed to meet the
expectations of financial regulators, data protection authorities, and
commercial partners. This overview summarizes the core registrations, filings,
and governance processes that underpin the organisation’s operations. It should
be reviewed at least quarterly alongside updates from legal counsel to ensure
the information remains accurate and complete.

## Corporate Structure and Governance

- **Parent entity:** Dynamic Capital, Inc., a Delaware corporation in good
  standing. Corporate records, bylaws, and board resolutions are stored in the
  internal governance repository and mirrored to the registered agent’s portal.
- **Subsidiaries and affiliates:** Any new subsidiary must undergo a legal
  entity creation review that covers jurisdictional requirements, tax
  registrations, banking arrangements, and local representation obligations.
- **Board oversight:** The board of directors maintains an annual compliance
  calendar that tracks regulatory filings, audit engagements, and major risk
  assessments. Minutes documenting board review of compliance matters are
  retained for a minimum of seven years.
- **Policy management:** All public-facing policies (including the Privacy
  Notice, Terms of Use, Cookie Policy, General Risk Warning, and Acceptable Use
  Policy) are version-controlled. Updates require dual approval from Legal and
  the accountable business owner before publication.

## Financial Services and Fintech Licensing

Dynamic Capital does not currently hold customer deposits or execute trades on
behalf of customers. If the business model expands into regulated activities,
the following licensing pathways must be evaluated before launch:

- **Investment advisory services (United States):** Registration with the U.S.
  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or applicable state regulators may be
  required under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Legal must prepare Form
  ADV filings, supervisory procedures, and adviser representative registrations
  where necessary.
- **Broker-dealer activity:** Any order routing, matching, or execution services
  involving securities trigger the need for Financial Industry Regulatory
  Authority (FINRA) membership and compliance with SEC Rule 15c3-5. Written
  supervisory procedures, net capital planning, and anti-money laundering (AML)
  programmes must be finalised before operations commence.
- **Money transmission and virtual asset services:** Offering custodial wallets
  or fiat on-ramps may require state-by-state money transmitter licences in the
  U.S. and virtual asset service provider (VASP) registrations in the European
  Union, United Kingdom, Singapore, or other jurisdictions. Compliance must
  coordinate licensing roadmaps and surety bond procurement with Finance.
- **MiCA and FCA crypto regimes:** The EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation
  (MiCA) and the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s 2025 cryptoasset promotion
  regime introduce additional authorisation and disclosure requirements for
  stablecoin issuance, exchange services, and staking. Product teams must engage
  Legal before marketing any in-scope services within the EEA or UK.
- **Derivatives and commodities:** Providing futures, swaps, or leveraged token
  products may bring the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and
  National Futures Association (NFA) within scope. Commodity pool operator (CPO)
  or commodity trading adviser (CTA) registration assessments are mandatory
  before marketing any such products.
- **Cross-border marketing:** Passporting regimes (e.g., EU AIFMD, Canadian
  provincial exemptions, Singapore CMSL) require prior notification. Local
  counsel should confirm solicitation permissions before launching campaigns.

## Data Protection and Privacy Filings

- **GDPR, UK GDPR, and EU AI Act:** Dynamic Capital leverages an authorised EU
  and UK representative network, supported by Article 30 records of processing
  activities, data protection impact assessments (DPIAs), and AI impact
  assessments where models materially affect customers. The Data Protection
  Officer (DPO) maintains contact details for supervisory authorities and
  coordinates breach notifications within statutory timelines.
- **U.S. privacy laws:** Compliance monitors developments in the California
  Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA), Virginia CDPA, Colorado Privacy Act, Utah
  Consumer Privacy Act, Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, and other emerging
  regimes. The privacy notice, opt-out controls, and Global Privacy Control
  (GPC) handling are updated whenever new state-level rights are enacted.
- **International data transfers:** Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), the EU–
  U.S. Data Privacy Framework, or other approved transfer mechanisms are
  executed with processors handling personal data outside of the originating
  jurisdiction. Transfer impact assessments are logged in the trust and safety
  workspace.
- **Breach reporting:** Incident response runbooks align with U.S. state
  timelines, the EU Network and Information Security Directive (NIS2), and UK
  reporting expectations. All reportable events must be escalated to Legal
  within 24 hours of discovery.

## Anti-Money Laundering and Financial Crime Controls

- **KYC programme:** Customer onboarding leverages risk-based verification,
  screening against government watchlists, and ongoing monitoring using
  third-party vendors. Enhanced due diligence is required for high-risk
  customers, politically exposed persons (PEPs), and corporate accounts with
  complex ownership structures.
- **Transaction monitoring:** Automated scenarios flag anomalous activity across
  fiat and digital asset flows. Alerts are triaged within 24 hours and outcomes
  documented in the case management system.
- **Suspicious activity reporting:** Procedures align with Bank Secrecy Act
  (BSA), Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and equivalent
  international expectations. Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) or analogous
  filings must be submitted within required deadlines and retained per
  regulatory guidance.
- **Sanctions compliance:** Operations rely on the latest Office of Foreign
  Assets Control (OFAC), United Nations, European Union, and UK sanctions lists.
  Screening occurs at onboarding and continuously thereafter. Potential matches
  are escalated to the sanctions officer for adjudication.

## Insurance and Professional Certifications

- **Errors and omissions (E&O) coverage:** Policies should be reviewed annually
  to confirm limits align with contractual obligations and projected revenue.
- **Cyber liability insurance:** Minimum coverage must support incident response
  costs, notification expenses, and regulatory investigations arising from
  security events.
- **Third-party attestations:** SOC 2 Type II, ISO/IEC 27001, penetration
  testing reports, and NIST CSF maturity assessments are catalogued in the
  compliance portal to support due diligence requests from enterprise customers.

## Recordkeeping and Reporting

- Maintain a centralised register of all active licences, application statuses,
  renewal dates, and responsible owners.
- Track statutory reporting obligations (e.g., Form PF, Form CRS, MiFID II
  transaction reporting) using the compliance calendar. Escalate any risk of
  late filings to the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) immediately.
- Retain regulatory correspondence, inspection reports, and remediation plans in
  a secure evidence repository with role-based access controls.
- Review policy attestations semi-annually to confirm that staff acknowledge the
  latest versions of compliance-critical documents.

## Contact Information
