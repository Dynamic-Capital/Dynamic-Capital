# Licenses, Registrations, and Other Legal Matters

Dynamic Capital maintains a proactive compliance posture designed to meet the
expectations of financial regulators, data protection authorities, and
commercial partners. This overview summarizes the core registrations, filings,
and governance processes that underpin the organization’s operations. It should
be reviewed at least quarterly alongside updates from legal counsel to ensure
the information remains accurate and complete.

## Corporate Structure and Governance

- **Parent entity:** Dynamic Capital, Inc., a Delaware corporation in good
  standing. Corporate records, bylaws, and board resolutions are stored in the
  internal governance repository and mirrored to the registered agent’s portal.
- **Subsidiaries and affiliates:** Any new subsidiary must undergo a legal
  entity creation review that covers jurisdictional requirements, tax
  registrations, banking arrangements, and local representation obligations.
- **Board oversight:** The board of directors maintains an annual compliance
  calendar that tracks regulatory filings, audit engagements, and major risk
  assessments. Minutes documenting board review of compliance matters are
  retained for a minimum of seven years.

## Financial Services and Fintech Licensing

Dynamic Capital does not currently hold customer deposits or execute trades on
behalf of customers. If the business model expands into regulated activities,
the following licensing pathways must be evaluated before launch:

- **Investment advisory services (United States):** Registration with the U.S.
  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or applicable state regulators may be
  required under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Legal must prepare Form
  ADV filings, supervisory procedures, and adviser representative registrations
  where necessary.
- **Broker-dealer activity:** Any order routing, matching, or execution services
  involving securities trigger the need for Financial Industry Regulatory
  Authority (FINRA) membership and compliance with SEC Rule 15c3-5. Written
  supervisory procedures, net capital planning, and anti-money laundering (AML)
  programs must be finalized before operations commence.
- **Money transmission and virtual asset services:** Offering custodial wallets
  or fiat on-ramps may require state-by-state money transmitter licenses in the
  U.S. and virtual asset service provider (VASP) registrations in the European
  Union, United Kingdom, Singapore, or other jurisdictions. Compliance must
  coordinate licensing roadmaps and surety bond procurement with finance.
- **Derivatives and commodities:** Providing futures, swaps, or leveraged token
  products may bring the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and
  National Futures Association (NFA) within scope. Commodity pool operator (CPO)
  or commodity trading advisor (CTA) registration assessments are mandatory
  before marketing any such products.

## Data Protection and Privacy Filings

- **GDPR and UK GDPR:** Dynamic Capital leverages an authorized EU and UK
  representative network, supported by Article 30 records of processing
  activities and data protection impact assessments (DPIAs). The Data Protection
  Officer (DPO) maintains contact details for supervisory authorities and
  coordinates breach notifications within statutory timelines.
- **U.S. state privacy laws:** Compliance monitors developments in the
  California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA), Virginia CDPA, Colorado Privacy
  Act, and similar regimes. The privacy notice and opt-out controls are updated
  whenever new state-level rights are enacted.
- **International data transfers:** Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other
  approved transfer mechanisms are executed with all processors handling
  personal data outside of the originating jurisdiction. Transfer impact
  assessments are logged in the trust and safety workspace.

## Anti-Money Laundering and Financial Crime Controls

- **KYC program:** Customer onboarding leverages risk-based verification,
  screening against government watchlists, and ongoing monitoring using
  third-party vendors. Enhanced due diligence is required for high-risk
  customers, politically exposed persons (PEPs), and corporate accounts with
  complex ownership structures.
- **Suspicious activity reporting:** Procedures align with Bank Secrecy Act
  (BSA) expectations. Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) or analogous filings
  must be submitted within required deadlines and retained per regulatory
  guidance.
- **Sanctions compliance:** Operations rely on the latest Office of Foreign
  Assets Control (OFAC), United Nations, European Union, and UK sanctions lists.
  Screening occurs at onboarding and continuously thereafter. Potential matches
  are escalated to the sanctions officer for adjudication.

## Insurance and Professional Certifications

- **Errors and omissions (E&O) coverage:** Policies should be reviewed annually
  to confirm limits align with contractual obligations and projected revenue.
- **Cyber liability insurance:** Minimum coverage must support incident response
  costs, notification expenses, and regulatory investigations arising from
  security events.
- **Third-party attestations:** SOC 2 Type II, ISO/IEC 27001, and penetration
  testing reports are cataloged in the compliance portal to support due
  diligence requests from enterprise customers.

## Recordkeeping and Reporting

- Maintain a centralized register of all active licenses, application statuses,
  renewal dates, and responsible owners.
- Track statutory reporting obligations (e.g., Form PF, Form CRS, MiFID II
  transaction reporting) using the compliance calendar. Escalate any risk of
  late filings to the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) immediately.
- Retain regulatory correspondence, inspection reports, and remediation plans in
  a secure evidence repository with role-based access controls.

## Contact Information

For questions about licensing or regulatory matters, contact
`legal@dynamic.capital` or the Chief Compliance Officer via the internal
communications directory. Urgent regulatory inquiries should be escalated
through the incident response hotline to ensure timely handling.
