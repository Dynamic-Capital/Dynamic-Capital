# Cookie and Tracking Policy

_Last updated: March 2025_

This Cookie and Tracking Policy explains how Dynamic Capital uses cookies,
pixels, software development kits (SDKs), and similar technologies (collectively
"cookies") when you visit our websites, use our applications, or interact with
our online services. It also describes the options available to manage your
preferences.

## 1. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small data files placed on your device when you visit a website or
use an application. They help remember your preferences, enable core
functionality, and provide analytics about how users interact with our services.
Related technologies, such as local storage, web beacons, tracking pixels, and
software development kits serve similar purposes.

## 2. Types of Cookies We Use

- **Strictly necessary cookies:** Required for core functionality such as
  account authentication, security, and load balancing. These cookies cannot be
  disabled without impacting service availability.
- **Performance and analytics cookies:** Collect information about how visitors
  use our services, including page views, navigation patterns, and error logs.
  We use this data to improve reliability and user experience.
- **Functionality cookies:** Remember user preferences, such as language,
  timezone, or saved dashboards, to provide a personalised experience.
- **Marketing cookies:** Track engagement with campaigns, landing pages, and
  referral sources. Marketing cookies are used only with appropriate consent and
  may be managed through our preference centre.
- **Experimental and AI telemetry cookies:** Support testing of new features,
  including AI models, by capturing anonymised interaction metrics to improve
  relevance and safety.

## 3. Third-Party Cookies

Dynamic Capital partners with trusted service providers that may set cookies on
our behalf. These providers support analytics, customer support, security,
payment processing, and marketing functions. We review vendor privacy practices
and require contractual commitments to safeguard data. Links to third-party
policies are available within our in-product preference centre.

## 4. Managing Preferences

- Use the in-product cookie banner or preference centre to accept, decline, or
  adjust categories of cookies.
- Modify browser settings to block or delete cookies. Note that disabling
  strictly necessary cookies may affect functionality.
- For mobile applications, adjust tracking settings within the device’s privacy
  controls or through the application’s settings page.
- Opt out of third-party analytics or marketing partners using the links
  provided within the preference centre or through industry opt-out mechanisms
  such as the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or Digital Advertising
  Alliance (DAA).
- Where available, we honour Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals as requests to
  opt out of targeted advertising or the sale of personal information.

## 5. Do Not Track

Some browsers support a “Do Not Track” (DNT) signal. Because there is no common
industry standard, Dynamic Capital does not currently respond to DNT signals.
Users can manage tracking preferences using the tools described above.

## 6. Retention

Cookie lifespans vary based on their purpose. Session cookies expire when you
close your browser, while persistent cookies remain until their scheduled
expiration or deletion. We periodically review cookie inventories to ensure they
remain aligned with business needs and legal requirements.

## 7. Updates to This Policy

We may update this Cookie and Tracking Policy to reflect changes in technology,
applicable law, or our business practices. Updates will be posted on this page
with an updated “Last updated” date. Significant changes may also be announced
through in-product notifications or email.
