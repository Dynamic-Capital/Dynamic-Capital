# Quantum Interpretation of Wyckoff Market Dynamics

This document reinterprets Wyckoff's market methodology by mapping its core
concepts to quantum-mechanical formalisms. The goal is to provide a structured
vocabulary for experimentation with probabilistic market models inspired by
quantum theory.

## 1. Market State as a Wave Function

- Represent the instantaneous market configuration as a normalized state vector
  \(|\Psi(t)\rangle = \sum_i c_i |p_i, v_i\rangle\).
- Each basis \(|p_i, v_i\rangle\) encodes a discrete price/volume pair while the
  complex amplitudes \(c_i\) capture probabilistic weight.
- Normalization \(\sum_i |c_i|^2 = 1\) ensures well-defined measurement
  probabilities.

## 2. Wyckoff Phases as Observables

- Model regime classification (accumulation, markup, distribution, markdown) via
  the diagonal phase operator \(\hat{\Phi}\) with those regimes as eigenvalues.
- The expected phase at time \(t\) is given by \(\langle\Phi\rangle =
  \langle\Psi(t)|\hat{\Phi}|\Psi(t)\rangle\).

## 3. Price-Volume Uncertainty

- Introduce a market analogue of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
  \(\Delta P \cdot \Delta V \geq \hbar_{\text{market}} / 2\).
- \(\Delta P\) and \(\Delta V\) are computed from the respective expectation
  values, bounding simultaneous price/volume precision and reflecting liquidity
  noise.

## 4. Market Hamiltonian and Time Evolution

- Evolve the state with a Schrödinger-style equation,
  \(i\hbar_{\text{market}} \partial_t |\Psi\rangle = \hat{H} |\Psi\rangle\).
- Decompose \(\hat{H}\) into volatility (kinetic) and potential terms driven by
  supply, demand, and smart-money pressures.

## 5. Tunneling Analogues (Springs and Upthrusts)

- Treat support/resistance tests as barrier-penetration problems with tunneling
  probability \(T = e^{-2\kappa a}\).
- Parameters correspond to barrier strength, order-flow energy, and penetration
  depth, offering a probabilistic view of springs and upthrusts.

## 6. Phase Superposition and Collapse

- Prior to decisive price action, represent ambiguity as a superposition of
  Wyckoff phases with amplitudes \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta\).
- Market observation (e.g., breakout) acts as measurement, collapsing the state
  to a single regime.

## 7. Density Matrix for Mixed Regimes

- Capture regime uncertainty with a density matrix
  \(\hat{\rho} = \sum_i p_i |\Psi_i\rangle\langle\Psi_i|\).
- Expectation values follow \(\langle\hat{O}\rangle = \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{\rho} \hat{O})\)
  and purity \(\operatorname{Tr}(\hat{\rho}^2)\) measures clarity of trend.

## 8. Entanglement Across Assets

- Encode cross-asset correlations through entangled states
  \(|\Psi\rangle_{AB} \neq |\Psi\rangle_A \otimes |\Psi\rangle_B\).
- Quantify correlation strength using entanglement entropy
  \(S = -\operatorname{Tr}(\hat{\rho}_A \log \hat{\rho}_A)\).

## 9. Path Integral Perspective

- Evaluate transition likelihoods as a sum over all admissible price paths with
  weight \(e^{i S[p(t)] / \hbar_{\text{market}}}\).
- The Lagrangian \(L = T - V\) balances volatility and potential forces; the
  classical limit identifies the dominant trend path.

## 10. Quantum-Inspired Trading Signal

- Define a composite measurement operator
  \(\hat{M} = \hat{P}_{\text{phase}} \hat{S}_{\text{spring}} \hat{V}_{\text{volume}}\)
  to project entry states onto actionable outcomes.
- Estimate trade probability as \(P(\text{trade}) = |
  \langle\text{exit}| \hat{M} |\text{entry}\rangle |^2\).
- Position sizing derives from expectation values of a confidence operator and
  risk operators.

## 11. Decoherence and Regime Shifts

- Model regime transitions via a master equation with decoherence term
  \(\partial_t \hat{\rho} = -\frac{i}{\hbar_{\text{market}}}[\hat{H}, \hat{\rho}] +
  D[\hat{\rho}]\).
- The decoherence time \(\tau_d\) characterizes how quickly macro events or
  news disrupt phase coherence.

## 12. Harmonic Oscillator Analogy for Ranges

- Approximate ranging markets with a quantum harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian
  \(\hat{H} = \hat{p}^2/(2m) + (1/2) m \omega^2 \hat{x}^2\).
- Energy levels \(E_n = \hbar_{\text{market}} \omega (n + 1/2)\) indicate
  widening oscillations as the market absorbs energy.

## 13. Decision Functional for Strategy Optimization

- Formulate action selection as maximizing expected utility,
  \(\text{Action} = \arg\max_a \sum_s P(s|\Psi) \cdot U(s, a)\).
- Candidate actions include buy, sell, hold, and position-sizing adjustments.

## Practical Implementation Considerations

1. Select a finite Hilbert space basis covering relevant price/volume bins.
2. Calibrate \(\hbar_{\text{market}}\) against historical volatility regimes.
3. Define the operators for observables of interest using empirical data.
4. Integrate the Schrödinger equation numerically to evolve state estimates.
5. Extract actionable signals from expectation values and measurement
   probabilities.

This framework is exploratory and intended for research prototypes rather than
immediate production deployment.
