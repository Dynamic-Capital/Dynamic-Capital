# Post-TGE Transparency & Diligence Cadence

Tonstarter requires an explicit plan for follow-up diligence calls and ongoing
transparency once DCT launches. This calendar excerpt summarizes the cadence
adopted by Dynamic Capital.

   from STON.fi and DeDust analytics).
2. **Treasury movements** – Burns, buybacks, staking emissions with transaction
   hashes.
3. **Product updates** – Feature releases, Mini App adoption stats, AI copilots
   usage.
4. **Community health** – Subscriber growth, mentorship retention, support
   backlog snapshot.

Reports are published every Friday at 18:00 UTC in the investor Notion workspace
and cross-posted to the transparency Telegram channel. Copies are archived under

during diligence calls.
