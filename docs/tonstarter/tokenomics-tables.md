# DCT Tokenomics Tables (Tonstarter Export)

This document mirrors the Dynamic Capital Token (DCT) tokenomics blueprint so
the production repository carries the same reference tables reviewed with the
Tonstarter diligence team.

## Allocation Summary

| Bucket                              | Amount (DCT) | Percent of Supply | Unlock & Vesting Notes                                                                                                      |

## Sale Round Breakdown

| Round                         | Allocation (DCT) | Price / Basis              | Unlock Schedule                             | Notes                                                                                      |

The pricing ladder and unlock schedules align with the projections generated by
the Tonstarter sale planner (`algorithms/python/dct_tonstarter_sale.py`) and
satisfy Tonstarter’s requirement for reproducible math within the repository.

## Circulating Supply Methodology Snapshot

```
Total Supply: 100,000,000 DCT
Less: Community Mining locked remainder (37,000,000 DCT) — balance emitted via the three proof-of-contribution phases after the 3,000,000 TGE drop
Less: Ecosystem & Partnerships locked remainder (18,000,000 DCT) — milestone-triggered vesting over 36 months
Less: Treasury & R&D (15,000,000 DCT) — 60-month linear release with governance pause rights
Less: Team (10,000,000 DCT) — 12-month cliff + 48-month linear vesting
Less: Investor Alignment Round (7,000,000 DCT) — 6-month cliff + 36-month linear vesting
------------------------------------------------------------
Projected Circulating Supply at TGE: 13,000,000 DCT
```

The calculations above match the figures shared with Tonstarter reviewers. Any
future revisions must update this file alongside the whitepaper to maintain
consistency.
