# DCT Tokenomics Tables (Tonstarter Export)

This document mirrors the Tonstarter-approved tokenomics revision v3.2 so the
production repository carries the same reference tables that were previously
hosted in the diligence data room.

## Allocation Summary

| Bucket                   | Amount (DCT) | Percent of Supply | Unlock & Vesting Notes                                                                                           |

## Sale Round Breakdown

| Round                           | Allocation (DCT) | Price / Basis              | Unlock Schedule                                    | Notes                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Community Launch (TGE)          | 3,000,000        | ≈0.12 TON (Dutch auction)  | 100% at TGE with optional 90-day staking boosters  | Fuels quests and referral campaigns; represents the 3% community unlock.                   |
| Liquidity Bootstrap Pools       | 5,000,000        | Treasury basis ≈$0.10      | 100% at TGE, deployed to STON.fi and DeDust pools  | Seeds two-sided liquidity across TON pairs and remains treasury-supervised.                |
| Strategic Partnerships Unlock   | 2,000,000        | N/A                        | 2% unlocked at TGE; remainder vests over 24 months | Supports integrations, custodians, and exchange collaborations tied to milestone delivery. |

The pricing ladder and unlock schedules align with the projections generated by
the Tonstarter sale planner (`algorithms/python/dct_tonstarter_sale.py`) and
satisfy Tonstarter’s requirement for reproducible math within the repository.

## Circulating Supply Methodology Snapshot

```
Total Supply: 100,000,000 DCT
Less: Ecosystem & Staking (34,000,000 DCT) — remainder after seeding 3,000,000 DCT to the community drop and 3,000,000 DCT to the initial staking tranche at TGE
Less: Investor Pool / Fund Ops (25,000,000 DCT) — 6-month cliff + 24-month linear vesting
Less: Founders & Team (15,000,000 DCT) — 12-month cliff + 36-month linear vesting
Less: Treasury & Emergency (10,000,000 DCT) — 60-month linear release with governance pause rights
Less: Partnerships & Liquidity locked remainder (3,000,000 DCT) — balance that vests over 24 months after the 5% liquidity and 2% partnership TGE unlocks
-------------------------------------------
Projected Circulating Supply at TGE: 13,000,000 DCT
```

The calculations above match the figures shared with Tonstarter reviewers. Any
future revisions must update this file alongside the whitepaper to maintain
consistency.
