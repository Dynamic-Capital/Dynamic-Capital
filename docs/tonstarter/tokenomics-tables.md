# DCT Tokenomics Tables (Tonstarter Export)

This document mirrors the Tonstarter-approved tokenomics revision v3.2 so the
production repository carries the same reference tables that were previously
hosted in the diligence data room.

## Allocation Summary

| Bucket              | Amount (DCT) | Percent of Supply | Unlock & Vesting Notes                                                         |

## Sale Round Breakdown

| Round                         | Allocation (DCT) | Price (USD)               | Unlock Schedule                                          | Notes                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Private Sale (Seed Investors) | 10,000,000       | $0.020                    | 20% at TGE, remaining 80% vests linearly over six months | Aligns with the "Private Sale (Seed Investors)" plan in the whitepaper.                                                |
| Public Sale (Tonstarter IDO)  | 15,000,000       | $0.050                    | 100% at TGE                                              | Tonstarter community sale; no lock-up to accelerate circulation.                                                       |
| Liquidity Bootstrap           | 5,000,000        | Treasury cost basis $0.10 | Locked in DEX pools                                      | Matches the STON.fi / DeDust plan in [`docs/dynamic-capital-ton-whitepaper.md`](../dynamic-capital-ton-whitepaper.md). |

The pricing ladder and unlock schedules align with the projections generated by
the Tonstarter sale planner (`algorithms/python/dct_tonstarter_sale.py`) and
satisfy Tonstarter’s requirement for reproducible math within the repository.

## Circulating Supply Methodology Snapshot

```
Total Supply: 100,000,000 DCT
Less: Treasury (20,000,000 DCT) — locked behind multisig + timelock
Less: Team & Advisors (15,000,000 DCT) — subject to cliff/vesting contract
Less: Staking Rewards (un-emitted portion) — gated by emission scheduler
Less: Liquidity Provision (5,000,000 DCT) — pooled with TON/USDT, accounted for separately
-------------------------------------------
Projected Circulating Supply at TGE: 60,000,000 DCT
```

The calculations above match the figures shared with Tonstarter reviewers. Any
future revisions must update this file alongside the whitepaper to maintain
consistency.
