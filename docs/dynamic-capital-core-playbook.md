## Mission Alignment

**Objective.** Ensure every program, investment, and narrative advances the
mission of building merciful, ethical wealth that uplifts communities.

**Cadence.**

- Run a quarterly mission review to restate the vision, refine the one-page
  mission brief, and validate strategic priorities.
- Begin weekly leadership and squad sessions with a one-minute mission reset to
  link current work with long-term purpose.

**Plays.**

- Maintain a mission brief that includes the core promise, differentiators, and
  non-negotiables. Require new proposals to reference the brief explicitly.
- Publish a quarterly "mission impact memo" summarizing how capital, products,
  and stories served communities.

**Signals & Metrics.**

- ≥90% of quarterly initiatives explicitly link to at least one mission lever
  (community uplift, ethical wealth, knowledge sharing).
- Employee survey shows ≥85% clarity on how their work advances the mission.

## Strategic Foundations

**Objective.** Provide a living, horizon-based strategy that balances current
delivery, near-term scaling, and long-horizon innovation.

**Cadence.**

- Refresh the horizon roadmap every quarter with a mid-cycle health check at
  week six.
- Update the hypothesis tracker whenever a new bet is funded or a kill-switch is
  triggered.

**Plays.**

- Classify initiatives as **Now (0-3 months)**, **Next (3-12 months)**, or **New
  (12+ months)** and enforce portfolio guardrails of 60/30/10 respectively.
- For each bet, document the assumption set, success metrics, risk triggers, and
  decision date in the hypothesis tracker.

**Signals & Metrics.**

- No horizon exceeds ±10% of its allocated capacity.
- Each hypothesis has an assigned owner, test design, and next review date.

## Operating Rhythm

**Objective.** Keep teams synchronized, unblock execution, and surface risks
before they escalate.

**Cadence.**

- Weekly leadership sync focused on top priorities, talent, and systemic risks.
- Bi-weekly squad reviews analyzing metrics, customer feedback, and backlog
  hygiene.
- Monthly "mission council" aligning capital allocation, people moves, and
  ecosystem partnerships.

**Plays.**

- Distribute agenda packets 24 hours in advance with data snapshots and decision
  requests.
- Track blockers in a shared priority board and assign a resolver within 24
  hours.
- Maintain a heat-map of risk levels across squads and review it during the
  mission council.

**Signals & Metrics.**

- <2 unresolved blockers per squad for more than one week.
- Action items closed within the agreed SLA (typically 5 business days).

## Product & Innovation

**Objective.** Build products and services around customer transformation with
disciplined experimentation.

**Cadence.**

- Run rolling discovery sprints with paired builders and domain experts.
- Close each sprint with a learning review feeding into the innovation log.

**Plays.**

- Frame initiatives using a "customer journey transformation" canvas instead of
  feature lists.
- Require every experiment to log hypothesis, method, signal to watch, and
  decision threshold in the innovation log.
- Pair prototypes with real-world validators (customers, scholars, partners)
  before scaling.

**Signals & Metrics.**

- At least two validated learnings recorded per sprint.
- <20% of experiments continue past their decision date without an explicit
  recommit.

## Capital & Risk Stewardship

**Objective.** Protect the trust (_amanah_) placed in Dynamic Capital by
managing funds prudently and transparently.

**Cadence.**

- Maintain a monthly financial cockpit covering liquidity, exposure, and
  guardrails.
- Conduct quarterly stress tests across downside, base, and upside scenarios.

**Plays.**

- Assign a named steward for every pool of capital with an agreed reporting
  cadence and escalation path.
- Couple each risk statement with its mitigation, contingency plan, and review
  date.
- Review compliance and audit trails alongside financials to ensure ethical
  alignment.

**Signals & Metrics.**

- Liquidity buffer ≥ six months of operating runway.
- 100% of high-severity risks have an active mitigation owner and next review
  logged.

## People & Culture

**Objective.** Cultivate a team of humble, disciplined operators who model
service-first leadership.

**Cadence.**

  compensation.

  great work.

**Signals & Metrics.**

- Pulse engagement ≥ 8/10 with commentary addressed within two weeks.
- 100% of team members paired with a mentor and reporting quarterly progress.

## Decision Protocols

**Objective.** Clarify authority, improve decision quality, and build
institutional memory.

**Cadence.**

- Apply protocols continuously; audit the decision journal monthly for
  completeness.

**Plays.**

- Label decisions as **Consult**, **Consent**, or **Command** in agendas and
  memos.
- Record irreversible or high-cost decisions in the decision journal with
  context, options considered, rationale, and observers.
- Debrief major decisions within 30 days to gather lessons and update playbooks.

**Signals & Metrics.**

- Fewer than 5% of critical decisions escalate due to unclear authority.
- Decision journal entries published within 48 hours of the decision.

## Measurement & Feedback

**Objective.** Monitor the health of mission impact, customers, finances, and
people using leading and lagging indicators.

**Cadence.**

- Review the balanced scorecard monthly and conduct structured 360° feedback
  each quarter.

  retention, profitability) to avoid blind spots.
- Use structured 360° prompts focusing on alignment, stewardship, and growth.
- Publish a monthly "insight digest" summarizing metric trends and actions.

**Signals & Metrics.**

- Every metric on the scorecard has an owner, target, and next action.

- Close each project with a retrospective (Start/Stop/Continue) within 10 days
  of delivery.
- Reserve 10% of quarterly capacity for a dedicated improvement sprint.

**Plays.**

- Translate retrospective insights into backlog items with owners and due dates.

  one-off patches.
- Recognize teams for resilience, experimentation, and documented learning—not
  only headline wins.

**Signals & Metrics.**
