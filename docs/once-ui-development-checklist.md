# Once UI Frontend & Backend Checklist

Use this checklist when you scope, build, and verify Dynamic Capital surfaces that rely on the Once UI design system (landing page, mini app shells, admin tooling). Track each checkbox in issues or PRs so reviewers can see coverage at a glance.

## 0. Align on Scope
- [ ] Confirm which surfaces (landing page, mini app, admin dashboard, marketing embeds) require Once UI updates and whether they are SSR, SSG, or client-rendered.
- [ ] Review related docs: [Development Workflow](./DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md), [code structure](./code-structure.md), and any flow runbooks (Mini App, Checkout, Admin) that describe impacted routes.
- [ ] Capture acceptance criteria for both the visual layer and data interactions (loading states, optimistic updates, admin-specific permissions).
- [ ] Identify dependencies on Supabase, Supabase Edge Functions, Go services, or queues so backend contracts stay compatible with UI expectations.

## 1. Prepare Once UI Foundation
- [ ] Verify Once UI assets are available to the target app (`once-ui.css`/`once-ui.js` via static import, bundler entry, or module federation) and match the expected version in `apps/landing/public/once-ui/`.
- [ ] Document any required global styles (body background, typography) or layout constraints (grid, spacing tokens) before coding to avoid ad-hoc overrides.
- [ ] Plan responsive breakpoints and theme variants (light/dark) using Once UI tokens so components remain consistent across surfaces.
- [ ] Decide whether custom Once UI components should live alongside existing shared components or in an app-specific folder; create stubs with prop signatures when collaboration is needed.
- [ ] Ensure the target React surface wraps its root layout with `MotionConfigProvider` so reduced-motion preferences are respected automatically.

## 2. Frontend Implementation
### Layout & Components
- [ ] Reuse or extend existing layout wrappers (`once-container`, shared page shells) instead of redefining grid and spacing utilities.
- [ ] Reach for the motion-enabled Once UI primitives (`<OnceContainer>`, `<OnceButton>`) before composing raw `motion.*` elements so animation tokens stay centralized.
- [ ] Ensure Once UI components accept data via typed props and expose slots/hooks for dynamic states (loading, empty, error) rather than hardcoding copy.
- [ ] Encapsulate repeated UI into composable components and update Storybook/MDX (if applicable) or inline docs that explain usage constraints.

### Styling & Theming
- [ ] Apply semantic Once UI classes (`once-btn`, `primary`, `outline`, typography helpers) or Tailwind tokens that map to the same palette; avoid raw hex colors or inline styles except for prototypes.
- [ ] Confirm interactive states (hover, focus, pressed, disabled) respect accessibility contrast and use the shared transition durations.
- [ ] Keep custom CSS scoped via module files or `:where` selectors so global Once UI styles remain unmodified.
- [ ] Use the shared motion tokens exported from `@/lib/motion-variants` (`onceMotionVariants`, `ONCE_MOTION_SPRINGS`, etc.) instead of redefining easing, durations, or stagger timings.

### Accessibility & Interaction
- [ ] Provide accessible names, roles, and ARIA attributes for interactive Once UI components (buttons, dialogs, tabs) and ensure keyboard navigation flows match WCAG.
- [ ] Wire up form validation and error messaging so assistive tech announces issues; include server-error fallback copy.
- [ ] Test front-end logic with sample data (approved payment, manual review, failure) to confirm state machines render the correct Once UI variants.
- [ ] Verify both React (`useReducedMotion`) and static (`data-once-reveal`) surfaces honour `prefers-reduced-motion` and still present content when JavaScript is disabled.

## 3. Backend UI Support
- [ ] Audit API routes, Supabase RPCs, and Edge Functions that feed the UI to confirm they expose all fields required for Once UI components (labels, icons, status flags, pagination counts).
- [ ] Guarantee idempotent endpoints (especially webhook-backed flows) still return quickly with HTTP 200 while queueing heavy work, per the botâ€™s hard rules.
- [ ] Validate data contracts with unit/integration tests or Swagger/OpenAPI notes when UI expects new payload shapes.
- [ ] Add feature flags or configuration switches for Once UI rollouts so you can gate new components by tenant, plan, or environment.

## 4. QA & Launch
- [ ] Run automated checks relevant to the touchpoints (`npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run verify`, `bash scripts/fix_and_check.sh`, or service-specific builds like `npm run build:miniapp`).
- [ ] Execute manual QA across viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop) and theme variants; capture screenshots or recordings that demonstrate the Once UI changes.
- [ ] Verify hydration/SSR boundaries in Next.js apps (`npm run build && npm run start` locally or preview deploy) and ensure no hydration mismatch warnings occur.
- [ ] Document schema or API changes in the appropriate `docs/` guide and link the checklist in the PR description with notes on data migrations, feature flags, and manual QA evidence.
- [ ] Monitor Supabase logs, queue workers, and browser consoles after deployment to catch regressions; plan rollback steps if Once UI components impact protected payment flows.
- [ ] Smoke test static marketing pages that rely on `once-ui.js` helpers to confirm `window.OnceUI.observeReveals` works for dynamically injected nodes and that content remains visible without JavaScript.
