[^proto-evidence]: Whitepaper codifies the intelligence/execution/liquidity
    layers and the DCT hard-cap
    policy.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-ton-whitepaper.md†L6-L73】

[^proto-followup]: Audit notes keep the emissions dashboard in scope for
    post-launch monitoring updates.【F:docs/dct-ton-audit.md†L94-L120】

[^treasury-evidence]: Configuration locks the 100 M cap, routes 60/30/10 flows,
    and encodes staking multipliers plus theme governance
    data.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/config.yaml†L1-L51】

[^treasury-followup]: Release QA should confirm Supabase settings match the
    production addresses.【F:docs/dct-ton-audit.md†L105-L116】

[^allocator-evidence]: Tact allocator validates TIP-3 transfers, timelocks admin
    actions, forwards declared TON, and emits events covered by Deno regression
    tests.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/contracts/pool_allocator.tact†L32-L218】【F:dynamic-capital-ton/apps/tests/pool_allocator.test.ts†L1-L194】

[^allocator-followup]: Implementation checklist still needs the parsing,
    forwarding, and regression items marked
    complete.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L47-L99】

[^offchain-evidence]: Supabase wallet linking, subscription processing, and the
    Mini App runbook document deterministic onboarding paths for
    operators.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/supabase/functions/link-wallet/index.ts†L1-L118】【F:dynamic-capital-ton/supabase/functions/process-subscription/index.ts†L1-L158】【F:dynamic-capital-ton/apps/miniapp/README.md†L1-L52】

[^offchain-followup]: Attach wallet link and subscription suite outputs to
    release notes per audit guidance.【F:docs/dct-ton-audit.md†L15-L113】

[^runbook-evidence]: Go-Live Validation Playbook and Go Live Checklist include
    completed webhook, banking, duplicate, crypto, and admin checks for
    handover.【F:docs/go-live-validation-playbook.md†L1-L185】【F:docs/GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md†L17-L45】

[^runbook-followup]: File dry-run transcripts and API logs with each release
    package to keep the checklist
    audit-ready.【F:docs/GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md†L17-L45】

## Protocol & Product Snapshot

- **Multi-layer utility is locked in.** The whitepaper positions DCT as the
  proof-of-contribution asset across intelligence, execution, and liquidity
  layers while detailing supply cap, distribution, and treasury controls that
  match shipped configuration
  files.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-ton-whitepaper.md†L6-L99】【F:dynamic-capital-ton/config.yaml†L1-L31】
- **Allocator governance paths are enforced.** Timelocked router/treasury
  updates, pause toggles, and strict TIP-3 parsing guard the pool allocator so
  deposits route correctly and admin changes require queued
  execution.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/contracts/pool_allocator.tact†L32-L208】
- **Off-chain entry points are productionized.** Wallet linking, subscription
  processing, and Telegram Mini App guidance give operators deterministic flows
  for onboarding, billing, and support escalations ahead of liquidity
  activation.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/supabase/functions/link-wallet/index.ts†L1-L118】【F:dynamic-capital-ton/supabase/functions/process-subscription/index.ts†L1-L158】【F:dynamic-capital-ton/apps/miniapp/README.md†L1-L52】

## Engineering Health

### Automated Coverage & Evidence

- **Allocator regression tests** cover timelock scheduling, swap math, compliant
  TIP-3 transfers, withdrawal limits, and router forwarding to lock in recent
  fixes.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/apps/tests/pool_allocator.test.ts†L1-L194】
- **Supabase function suites** assert wallet conflict handling and subscription
  path validation, mirroring audit expectations that off-chain services stay
  deterministic.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/supabase/functions/link-wallet/index.test.ts†L1-L133】【F:docs/dct-ton-audit.md†L12-L36】
- **Technical audit tracking** notes that checklist updates and routine evidence
  capture remain required before handing over to operations, even though code
  paths are ready.【F:docs/dct-ton-audit.md†L15-L114】

### Runbooks & Operational Readiness

- The Go-Live Validation Playbook walks operators through webhook checks, bank
  receipt handling, crypto confirmations, and admin commands with
  offline-friendly guidance so evidence can be collected in constrained
  environments.【F:docs/go-live-validation-playbook.md†L1-L185】
- The Go Live Checklist now shows every validation checked off—webhook,
  happy-path and near-miss banking, duplicate safeguards, crypto confirmations,
  and admin responses—so ops inherit a green runbook
  package.【F:docs/GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md†L17-L45】

## Outstanding Actions

1. **Update the allocator implementation checklist.** The parsing, forwarding,
   and regression tasks are complete in code/tests but remain unchecked; close
   them out or document residual work for
   auditors.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L47-L99】
2. **Record routine quality gates.** Attach allocator and Supabase test outputs
   (plus lint/typecheck logs where relevant) to release notes or CI artifacts to
   satisfy audit guidance on execution
   evidence.【F:docs/dct-ton-audit.md†L25-L113】
3. **Archive the completed dry-run evidence.** File the webhook transcripts,
   bank review outputs, duplicate receipt rejection, crypto confirmation logs,
   and admin command exports alongside the latest release notes so auditors can
   trace each checklist item without
   reruns.【F:docs/GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md†L17-L45】【F:docs/go-live-validation-playbook.md†L1-L185】

## Next Steps

- Run `npm run go-live` on each release candidate to refresh evidence bundles
  before handoff, then re-run allocator and Supabase suites so the archive stays
  deterministic.
- Refresh `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and `GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md` immediately after
  tasks close so this status page stays audit-accurate for the next review
  cycle.
