# Dynamic Capital TON Coin Whitepaper

## Abstract

Dynamic Capital Token (DCT) is the proof-of-contribution asset that powers the Dynamic Capital intelligence network on The Open Network (TON). It unlocks trading intelligence, AGI mentorship, and execution tooling for contributors that actively strengthen the platform.

DCT rewards measurable improvements to the protocol. Optimization and refinement loops run back-to-back: contributors earn emissions by training models, operating infrastructure, and onboarding users, while treasury alignment and burn mechanics reinforce long-term scarcity and liquidity depth.

## Protocol Overview

Dynamic Capital delivers AI-assisted trading intelligence, execution infrastructure, and liquidity programs designed for traders operating across TON and connected Layer 2 venues.

- **Intelligence Layer** – Quantitative models and AI copilots that curate actionable strategies, risk dashboards, and automated alerts.
- **Execution Layer** – Routing, portfolio automation, and settlement tooling integrated with TON wallets and DEX venues.
- **Liquidity Layer** – Smart vaults and structured pools that coordinate capital across market-making, yield, and hedging strategies.

DCT serves as the cohesive utility for these layers by enforcing access controls, coordinating incentives, and providing settlement guarantees for protocol participants.

## Total Supply and Tokenomics

DCT tokenomics align emissions with meaningful contribution. Supply is permanently capped at 100,000,000 DCT, governed by a time-locked multisig with on-chain referendums required for any monetary change. Forty percent of supply flows through a proof-of-contribution program that scores model training, usage, and impact; emissions decay across three phases (Years 1–2, 3–4, 5–6) so rewards concentrate around early ecosystem building while still backing long-term growth.

At genesis, 13% of supply enters circulation: 3% funds community quests that seed Phase I, 5% bootstraps liquidity on TON venues, 2% powers partnership pilots, and 3% shores up the strategic reserve. Team, investor, and ecosystem allocations vest on-chain with transparent cliffs (team: 12-month cliff, 48-month linear; investors: 6-month cliff, 36-month linear; ecosystem: milestone-triggered releases over 36 months). The treasury and R&D budget streams linearly across 60 months with pause rights controlled by governance.

- Proof-of-Training, Proof-of-Usage, and Proof-of-Impact pools distribute 45%, 35%, and 20% of each month’s community budget respectively, ensuring high-quality data, live network activity, and ecosystem contributions are all compensated.
- Emission buckets inside each phase decay exponentially (E_m = E_0 · e^{-k m} with k ranging from 0.08 to 0.12) to discourage spam farming while keeping rewards available for sustained performance.
- Deflationary sinks remove up to 50% of protocol fees via burns, route 30% of DCT-denominated API spend to burns (the remaining 70% cycles to the treasury), and slash malicious contributors with 100% burn penalties.

## Price Structure Strategy

### Launch Pricing Mechanics

- Dual list on STON.fi (TON AMM) and a curated DeDust order-book pair within the first 24 hours to capture both retail and professional flow.
- Conduct a 72-hour Dutch auction with a price band of 0.08 to 0.12 TON per DCT, seeding 5% of supply; the clearing price seeds initial AMM pool ratios.
- Allocate the 5,000,000 DCT liquidity buffer 60% to TON:DCT on STON.fi, 30% to USDT:DCT on DeDust, and retain 10% in treasury for post-launch volatility absorption.
- Cap auction wallet orders at 1% of circulating supply per transaction and configure AMM pool weights to limit impact to <1% for 250,000 TON trades during the first week.


### Secondary-Market Support

- Maintain deep TON:DCT (STON.fi) and USDT:DCT (DeDust) liquidity with a minimum combined depth of 1,000,000 TON or equivalent within ±2% of the mid-price.
- Rebalance positions daily to keep at least 65% of treasury-managed liquidity in-range and ready for two-sided quotes.
- Offer 6% annualized DCT incentives for verified market-making desks that sustain >90% uptime and <50 bps quoted spreads on whitelisted venues.
- Trigger review if the 7-day moving average deviates ±15% from auction VWAP or if intraday volatility exceeds 40% annualized.


### Long-Term Stabilization Levers

- Deploy up to 20% of monthly net protocol fees toward on-chain buybacks, prioritizing periods where price trades below the 90-day moving average.
- Increase or decrease staking lock multipliers by 10% increments to modulate staking participation when circulating float exceeds or falls below target bands.
- Route 50% of all penalty fees and redeemed buybacks to permanent burns once treasury coverage exceeds 24 months of runway.
- Allow governance to throttle scheduled emissions by up to 25% per quarter when liquidity coverage or volatility metrics breach risk thresholds.


### Governance Oversight

- The DAO Multisig proposes parameter updates, which require a Token Assembly vote with a 48-hour timelock before execution.
- Emergency guardrails empower the Risk Council to impose temporary trading halts or rebalance liquidity within 12 hours when volatility triggers are breached, subject to post-event ratification.


### Monitoring & Reporting

- Publish real-time dashboards tracking price bands, AMM depth, circulating supply, and cumulative burn totals.
- Release weekly market-ops reports summarizing treasury interventions, buyback executions, and market-maker performance.
- Conduct a formal governance review of price structure levers every 30 days, with quarterly deep dives that audit performance against guardrail metrics.


### TON DEX Transparency Stack

| Strategic Reserve                   | 3,000,000    | 3%                | Governance-controlled emergency buffer with 48-hour activation timelock.                                                    |


- Community mining emissions follow an exponential decay model (E_m = E_0 · e^{-k m}) within each phase to reward ongoing contributions while preventing emission cliffs.
- Monthly pools allocate 45% to Proof-of-Training, 35% to Proof-of-Usage, and 20% to Proof-of-Impact so that data quality, real network activity, and broader ecosystem value all matter.
- By Year 3, recurring fee burns (50% of protocol fees, 30% of API payments) and targeted buybacks neutralize net inflation, with governance empowered to adjust k-values or pause emissions if coverage ratios tighten.

## Token Valuation Framework

Dynamic Capital maintains an auditable valuation model so contributors can verify how treasury performance, supply policy, and market activity translate into tokenholder value.

### Token Supply & Circulation

**Formula**

```
Circulating Supply = Total Supply - Locked Tokens - Treasury Reserves
```

Tracks unlock schedules and treasury buffers to project floating supply under different emission throttle settings.

### Contribution Yield

**Formula**

```
Contribution Yield = (Monthly Rewards · Contribution Score) / DCT Staked
```

Scores contributors on verifiable improvements (accuracy, profitability, mentorship impact) and scales rewards with stake-weighted commitments.

### Treasury Flywheel

**Formula**

```
Buyback Capacity = (Protocol Fees · 0.50) + (API Spend · 0.30) - Operations Budget
```

Quantifies net tokens removable from circulation after accounting for burn policies and reinvestment targets.

### Sale Rounds

Token distribution campaigns translate the long-term supply map into milestone-based launches that fund growth while protecting circulating float. The launch plan delivers 13,000,000 DCT at TGE across community, liquidity, and strategic partner channels, while long-dated allocations vest via governed cliffs.

## Utility Programs

### Access & Intelligence

- Stake DCT to unlock intelligence dashboards, streaming strategy alerts, and AGI mentorship tiers calibrated by contribution scores.
- DCT payments settle API credits, trading signal subscriptions, and early access to experimental models curated by the Risk Council.

### Liquidity & Treasury Alignment

- Liquidity providers earn boosted rewards when staking DCT alongside LP shares, aligning capital commitments with treasury guardrails.
- Treasury automation routes a portion of profits into market-making vaults that backstop volatility and fund buyback programs.

### Governance & Community

- Token Assembly proposals require bonded DCT deposits that are slashed if malicious or spam motions are submitted.
- Delegation frameworks empower strategy contributors to represent passive holders while publishing transparent voting scorecards.


## Treasury Mechanics

- Profit-sharing automation diverts 50% of protocol fees to scheduled buybacks and burns whenever coverage ratios exceed the 24-month runway target.
- DCT-denominated API payments burn 30% on receipt while recycling the remaining 70% into the R&D budget and performance pool.
- Slashing events burn 100% of seized stakes, reinforcing the proof-of-contribution quality bar.

## Governance Model

### Councils & Roles

- DAO Multisig stewards treasury programs, submits emission throttle changes, and escalates emergency measures.
- Risk Council monitors volatility, contribution quality, and liquidity health, invoking temporary halts when guardrails are breached.
- Community Guild curates quests, mentorship cohorts, and ecosystem partnerships to expand utility demand.


### Voting Requirements

Token Assembly proposals require 8% quorum and >60% supermajority, with contribution-weighted delegation amplifying high-impact voters.


### Participation Lifecycle

- Proposal lifecycle spans drafting, temperature check, formal vote, and execution with a minimum of seven days end-to-end.
- Snapshot integration captures off-chain signaling which is reconciled with staked DCT during final execution.

## Reporting & Transparency

### Cadence

- Weekly treasury notes summarize burns, buybacks, and liquidity program utilization.
- Monthly protocol health reports benchmark contribution yields, fee capture, and user growth relative to targets.


### Analytics Distribution

- Machine-readable dashboards expose supply, emission decay parameters, and treasury actions for partner validation.
- Historical datasets live in Supabase storage with signed attestations for auditors and ecosystem partners.
