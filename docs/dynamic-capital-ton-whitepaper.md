# Dynamic Capital TON Coin Whitepaper

## Abstract

Dynamic Capital Token (DCT) is the proof-of-contribution asset that powers the
Dynamic Capital intelligence network on The Open Network (TON). It unlocks
trading intelligence, AGI mentorship, and execution tooling for contributors
that actively strengthen the platform.

DCT rewards measurable improvements to the protocol. Optimization and refinement
loops run back-to-back: contributors earn emissions by training models,
operating infrastructure, and onboarding users, while treasury alignment and
burn mechanics reinforce long-term scarcity and liquidity depth.

## Protocol Overview

Dynamic Capital delivers AI-assisted trading intelligence, execution
infrastructure, and liquidity programs designed for traders operating across TON
and connected Layer 2 venues.

- **Intelligence Layer** – Quantitative models and AI copilots that curate
  actionable strategies, risk dashboards, and automated alerts.
- **Execution Layer** – Routing, portfolio automation, and settlement tooling
  integrated with TON wallets and DEX venues.
- **Liquidity Layer** – Smart vaults and structured pools that coordinate
  capital across market-making, yield, and hedging strategies.

DCT serves as the cohesive utility for these layers by enforcing access
controls, coordinating incentives, and providing settlement guarantees for
protocol participants.

## Total Supply and Tokenomics

DCT tokenomics align emissions with meaningful contribution. Supply is
permanently capped at 100,000,000 DCT, governed by a time-locked multisig with
on-chain referendums required for any monetary change. Forty percent of supply
flows through a proof-of-contribution program that scores model training, usage,
and impact; emissions decay across three phases (Years 1–2, 3–4, 5–6) so rewards
concentrate around early ecosystem building while still backing long-term
growth.

At genesis, 13% of supply enters circulation: 3% funds community quests that
seed Phase I, 5% bootstraps liquidity on TON venues, 2% powers partnership
pilots, and 3% shores up the strategic reserve. Team, investor, and ecosystem
allocations vest on-chain with transparent cliffs (team: 12-month cliff,
48-month linear; investors: 6-month cliff, 36-month linear; ecosystem:
milestone-triggered releases over 36 months). The treasury and R&D budget
streams linearly across 60 months with pause rights controlled by governance.

- Proof-of-Training, Proof-of-Usage, and Proof-of-Impact pools distribute 45%,
  35%, and 20% of each month’s community budget respectively, ensuring
  high-quality data, live network activity, and ecosystem contributions are all
  compensated.
- Emission buckets inside each phase decay exponentially (E_m = E_0 · e^{-k m}
  with k ranging from 0.08 to 0.12) to discourage spam farming while keeping
  rewards available for sustained performance.
- Deflationary sinks remove up to 50% of protocol fees via burns, route 30% of
  DCT-denominated API spend to burns (the remaining 70% cycles to the treasury),
  and slash malicious contributors with 100% burn penalties.

## Price Structure Strategy

### Launch Pricing Mechanics

- Dual list on STON.fi (TON AMM) and a curated DeDust order-book pair within the
  first 24 hours to capture both retail and professional flow.
- Conduct a 72-hour Dutch auction with a price band of 0.08 to 0.12 TON per DCT,
  seeding 5% of supply; the clearing price seeds initial AMM pool ratios.
- Allocate the 5,000,000 DCT liquidity buffer 60% to TON:DCT on STON.fi, 30% to
  USDT:DCT on DeDust, and retain 10% in treasury for post-launch volatility
  absorption.
- Cap auction wallet orders at 1% of circulating supply per transaction and
  configure AMM pool weights to limit impact to <1% for 250,000 TON trades
  during the first week.

### Secondary-Market Support

- Maintain deep TON:DCT (STON.fi) and USDT:DCT (DeDust) liquidity with a minimum
  combined depth of 1,000,000 TON or equivalent within ±2% of the mid-price.
- Rebalance positions daily to keep at least 65% of treasury-managed liquidity
  in-range and ready for two-sided quotes.
- Offer 6% annualized DCT incentives for verified market-making desks that
  sustain >90% uptime and <50 bps quoted spreads on whitelisted venues.
- Trigger review if the 7-day moving average deviates ±15% from auction VWAP or
  if intraday volatility exceeds 40% annualized.

### Long-Term Stabilization Levers

- Deploy up to 20% of monthly net protocol fees toward on-chain buybacks,
  prioritizing periods where price trades below the 90-day moving average.
- Increase or decrease staking lock multipliers by 10% increments to modulate
  staking participation when circulating float exceeds or falls below target
  bands.
- Route 50% of all penalty fees and redeemed buybacks to permanent burns once
  treasury coverage exceeds 24 months of runway.
- Allow governance to throttle scheduled emissions by up to 25% per quarter when
  liquidity coverage or volatility metrics breach risk thresholds.

### Governance Oversight

- The DAO Multisig proposes parameter updates, which require a Token Assembly
  vote with a 48-hour timelock before execution.
- Emergency guardrails empower the Risk Council to impose temporary trading
  halts or rebalance liquidity within 12 hours when volatility triggers are
  breached, subject to post-event ratification.

### Monitoring & Reporting

- Publish real-time dashboards tracking price bands, AMM depth, circulating
  supply, and cumulative burn totals.
- Release weekly market-ops reports summarizing treasury interventions, buyback
  executions, and market-maker performance.
- Conduct a formal governance review of price structure levers every 30 days,
  with quarterly deep dives that audit performance against guardrail metrics.

| Strategic Reserve                   | 3,000,000    | 3%                | Governance-controlled emergency buffer with 48-hour activation timelock.                                                    |

- Community mining emissions follow an exponential decay model (E_m = E_0 ·
  e^{-k m}) within each phase to reward ongoing contributions while preventing
  emission cliffs.
- Monthly pools allocate 45% to Proof-of-Training, 35% to Proof-of-Usage, and
  20% to Proof-of-Impact so that data quality, real network activity, and
  broader ecosystem value all matter.
- By Year 3, recurring fee burns (50% of protocol fees, 30% of API payments) and
  targeted buybacks neutralize net inflation, with governance empowered to
  adjust k-values or pause emissions if coverage ratios tighten.

## Token Valuation Framework

Dynamic Capital maintains an auditable valuation model so contributors can
verify how treasury performance, supply policy, and market activity translate
into tokenholder value.

### Token Supply & Circulation

**Formula**

```
Circulating Supply = Total Supply - Locked Tokens - Treasury Reserves
```

Tracks unlock schedules and treasury buffers to project floating supply under
different emission throttle settings.

### Contribution Yield

**Formula**

```
Contribution Yield = (Monthly Rewards · Contribution Score) / DCT Staked
```

Scores contributors on verifiable improvements (accuracy, profitability,
mentorship impact) and scales rewards with stake-weighted commitments.

### Treasury Flywheel

**Formula**

```
Buyback Capacity = (Protocol Fees · 0.50) + (API Spend · 0.30) - Operations Budget
```

Quantifies net tokens removable from circulation after accounting for burn
policies and reinvestment targets.

### Sale Rounds

Token distribution campaigns translate the long-term supply map into
milestone-based launches that fund growth while protecting circulating float.
The launch plan delivers 13,000,000 DCT at TGE across community, liquidity, and
strategic partner channels, while long-dated allocations vest via governed
cliffs.

## Utility Programs

### Access & Intelligence

- Stake DCT to unlock intelligence dashboards, streaming strategy alerts, and
  AGI mentorship tiers calibrated by contribution scores.
- DCT payments settle API credits, trading signal subscriptions, and early
  access to experimental models curated by the Risk Council.

### Liquidity & Treasury Alignment

- Liquidity providers earn boosted rewards when staking DCT alongside LP shares,
  aligning capital commitments with treasury guardrails.
- Treasury automation routes a portion of profits into market-making vaults that
  backstop volatility and fund buyback programs.

### Governance & Community

- Token Assembly proposals require bonded DCT deposits that are slashed if
  malicious or spam motions are submitted.
- Delegation frameworks empower strategy contributors to represent passive
  holders while publishing transparent voting scorecards.

## Treasury Mechanics

- Profit-sharing automation diverts 50% of protocol fees to scheduled buybacks
  and burns whenever coverage ratios exceed the 24-month runway target.
- DCT-denominated API payments burn 30% on receipt while recycling the remaining
  70% into the R&D budget and performance pool.
- Slashing events burn 100% of seized stakes, reinforcing the
  proof-of-contribution quality bar.

## Governance Model

### Councils & Roles

- DAO Multisig stewards treasury programs, submits emission throttle changes,
  and escalates emergency measures.
- Risk Council monitors volatility, contribution quality, and liquidity health,
  invoking temporary halts when guardrails are breached.
- Community Guild curates quests, mentorship cohorts, and ecosystem partnerships
  to expand utility demand.

### Voting Requirements

Token Assembly proposals require 8% quorum and >60% supermajority, with
contribution-weighted delegation amplifying high-impact voters.

### Participation Lifecycle

- Proposal lifecycle spans drafting, temperature check, formal vote, and
  execution with a minimum of seven days end-to-end.
- Snapshot integration captures off-chain signaling which is reconciled with
  staked DCT during final execution.

## Reporting & Transparency

### Cadence

- Weekly treasury notes summarize burns, buybacks, and liquidity program
  utilization.
- Monthly protocol health reports benchmark contribution yields, fee capture,
  and user growth relative to targets.

### Analytics Distribution

- Machine-readable dashboards expose supply, emission decay parameters, and
  treasury actions for partner validation.
- Historical datasets live in Supabase storage with signed attestations for
  auditors and ecosystem partners.
