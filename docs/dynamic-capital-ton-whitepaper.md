# Dynamic Capital TON Coin Whitepaper

## Abstract

Dynamic Capital TON Coin (DCT) is the on-chain utility token that powers the
Dynamic Capital ecosystem on The Open Network (TON). The asset enables
permissionless access to quantitative trading signals, liquidity coordination,
and governance.

DCT is engineered to align incentives between strategy contributors, capital
providers, and the treasury so that protocol growth directly benefits active
participants. This document outlines the economic model, supply schedule, and
token utilities that underpin the Dynamic Capital flywheel.

## Protocol Overview

Dynamic Capital delivers AI-assisted trading intelligence, execution
infrastructure, and liquidity programs designed for traders operating across TON
and connected Layer 2 venues.

- **Intelligence Layer** – Quantitative models and AI copilots that curate
  actionable strategies, risk dashboards, and automated alerts.
- **Execution Layer** – Routing, portfolio automation, and settlement tooling
  integrated with TON wallets and DEX venues.
- **Liquidity Layer** – Smart vaults and structured pools that coordinate
  capital across market-making, yield, and hedging strategies.

DCT serves as the cohesive utility for these layers by enforcing access
controls, coordinating incentives, and providing settlement guarantees for
protocol participants.

## Total Supply and Tokenomics

DCT tokenomics are meticulously designed to balance protocol liquidity with
long-run alignment between traders, contributors, and the treasury. The supply
is hard capped at 100,000,000 DCT under a time-locked multi-signature
controller; any future adjustments require an on-chain governance vote with
delayed execution safeguards. This mirrors the deployment configuration for the
jetton, anchoring monetary policy in auditable on-chain parameters.

At launch, circulating supply is constrained to the public circulation
allocation that fuels community growth initiatives alongside the dedicated
liquidity provision buffer. Treasury, team, advisor, staking, and liquidity
allocations are escrowed in TON vesting contracts with transparent cliffs and
drip schedules that mirror the table below. Unlock schedules are published ahead
of time, and governance can pause or re-sequence emissions if security or market
stability concerns arise.

- Treasury policies route a governed share of protocol fees toward buybacks and
  liquidity programs, reinforcing price stability while re-circulating value to
  active contributors.
- Additional sink mechanics—staking lock-ups, vault fees denominated in DCT, and
  programmatic burns triggered by slashing or inactivity—offset new issuance and
  anchor a deflationary bias over time.
- Circulating supply dashboards provide real-time unlock calendars and burn
  totals to maintain transparency.

## Price Structure Strategy

### Launch Pricing Mechanics

- Dual list on STON.fi (TON AMM) and a curated DeDust order-book pair within the
  first 24 hours to capture both retail and professional flow.
- Conduct a 72-hour Dutch auction with a price band of 0.08 to 0.12 TON per DCT,
  seeding 5% of supply; clearing price sets the initial AMM pool ratios.
- Allocate the 5,000,000 DCT liquidity buffer 60% to TON:DCT on STON.fi, 30% to
  USDT:DCT on DeDust, and retain 10% in treasury for post-launch volatility
  absorption.
- Cap auction wallet orders at 1% of circulating supply per transaction and
  configure AMM pool weights to limit impact to <1% for 250,000 TON trades
  during the first week.

### Secondary-Market Support

- Maintain deep TON:DCT (STON.fi) and USDT:DCT (DeDust) liquidity with a minimum
  combined depth of 1,000,000 TON or equivalent within ±2% of the mid-price.
- Rebalance positions daily to keep at least 65% of treasury-managed liquidity
  in-range and ready for two-sided quotes.
- Offer 6% annualized DCT incentives for verified market-making desks that
  sustain >90% uptime and <50 bps quoted spreads on whitelisted venues.
- Trigger review if the 7-day moving average deviates ±15% from auction VWAP or
  if intraday volatility exceeds 40% annualized.

### Long-Term Stabilization Levers

- Deploy up to 20% of monthly net protocol fees toward on-chain buybacks,
  prioritizing periods where price trades below the 90-day moving average.
- Increase or decrease staking lock multipliers by 10% increments to modulate
  staking participation when circulating float exceeds or falls below target
  bands.
- Route 50% of all penalty fees and redeemed buybacks to permanent burns once
  treasury coverage exceeds 24 months of runway.
- Allow governance to throttle scheduled emissions by up to 25% per quarter when
  liquidity coverage or volatility metrics breach risk thresholds.

### Governance Oversight

- The DAO Multisig proposes parameter updates, which require a Token Assembly
  vote with a 48-hour timelock before execution.
- Emergency guardrails empower the Risk Council to impose temporary trading
  halts or rebalance liquidity within 12 hours when volatility triggers are
  breached, subject to post-event ratification.

### Monitoring & Reporting

- Publish real-time dashboards tracking price bands, AMM depth, circulating
  supply, and cumulative burn totals.
- Release weekly market-ops reports summarizing treasury interventions, buyback
  executions, and market-maker performance.
- Conduct a formal governance review of price structure levers every 30 days,
  with quarterly deep dives that audit performance against guardrail metrics.

- Treasury-controlled mint functions are time-locked and require multi-signature
  authorization to protect against supply shocks.

### Sale Rounds

Token distribution campaigns translate the long-term supply map into
milestone-based raises that fund growth while protecting circulating float.

## Utility Programs

### Access & Intelligence

- Staking DCT unlocks advanced intelligence dashboards, streaming strategy
  alerts, and AI copilots tailored to TON markets.
- Tiered staking multipliers discount premium data feeds and grant early access
  to experimental models vetted by the Risk Council.

### Liquidity & Treasury Alignment

- Liquidity providers earn boosted rewards when staking DCT alongside LP shares,
  aligning capital commitments with treasury guardrails.
- Treasury automation routes a portion of profits into market-making vaults that
  backstop volatility and fund buyback programs.

### Governance & Community

- Token Assembly proposals require bonded DCT deposits that are slashed if
  malicious or spam motions are submitted.
- Delegation framework empowers strategy contributors to represent passive
  holders while publishing transparent voting scorecards.

## Treasury Mechanics

- Profit-sharing treasury automation triggers buybacks and burns when
  profitability metrics exceed thresholds, reinforcing scarcity without manual
  intervention.
- Vault fees denominated in DCT recycle value back into staking rewards,
  creating a closed loop between traders, contributors, and the treasury.

## Governance Model

### Councils & Roles

- DAO Multisig sets agendas, manages treasury programs, and escalates emergency
  measures.
- Risk Council monitors market integrity, halting liquidity programs or staking
  withdrawals when guardrails breach configured thresholds.
- Community Guild curates education, bounty programs, and ecosystem partnerships
  to expand utility demand.

### Voting Requirements

Token Assembly proposals require 8% quorum and >60% supermajority to pass, with
quadratic voting modifiers that reward longer staking commitments.

### Participation Lifecycle

- Proposal lifecycle spans drafting, temperature check, formal vote, and
  execution with a minimum of seven days end-to-end.
- Snapshot integration captures off-chain voting signals which are reconciled
  with on-chain stakes during final execution.

## Reporting & Transparency

### Cadence

- Weekly treasury notes summarize buybacks, burns, and staking participation
  metrics.
- Monthly protocol health reports benchmark liquidity depth, fee capture, and
  user growth relative to targets.

### Analytics Distribution

- All analytics APIs publish machine-readable feeds that partners can query to
  validate supply, emissions, and treasury actions.
- Historical data archives are preserved in Supabase storage with signed URLs
  for auditors and ecosystem partners.
