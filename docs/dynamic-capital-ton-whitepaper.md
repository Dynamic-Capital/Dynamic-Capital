# Dynamic Capital TON Coin Whitepaper

## Abstract

Dynamic Capital TON Coin (DCT) is the on-chain utility token that powers the
Dynamic Capital ecosystem on The Open Network (TON). The asset enables
permissionless access to quantitative trading signals, liquidity coordination,
and governance. DCT is engineered to align incentives between strategy
contributors, capital providers, and the treasury so that protocol growth
directly benefits active participants. This document outlines the economic
model, supply schedule, and token utilities that underpin the Dynamic Capital
flywheel.

## Protocol Overview

Dynamic Capital delivers AI-assisted trading intelligence, execution
infrastructure, and liquidity programs designed for traders operating across TON
and connected Layer 2 venues. Key components include:

- **Intelligence Layer** – Quantitative models and AI copilots that curate
  actionable strategies, risk dashboards, and automated alerts.
- **Execution Layer** – Routing, portfolio automation, and settlement tooling
  integrated with TON wallets and DEX venues.
- **Liquidity Layer** – Smart vaults and structured pools that coordinate
  capital across market-making, yield, and hedging strategies.

DCT serves as the cohesive utility for these layers by enforcing access
controls, coordinating incentives, and providing settlement guarantees for
protocol participants.

Emission events are orchestrated via audited TON smart contracts.
Treasury-controlled mint functions are time-locked and require multi-signature
authorization to protect against supply shocks.

## Utility

DCT underpins multiple protocol incentives:

- **Access Tiers** – Staking DCT unlocks progressively advanced trading tools,
  signal bandwidth, and AI copilots. Tier requirements adjust dynamically using
  governance-approved parameters.
- **Fee Reductions** – Holding or staking DCT grants rebates on execution fees,
  vault performance fees, and data subscription costs.
- **Liquidity Mining** – Market makers and vault depositors earn DCT rewards
  proportional to depth, uptime, and risk-adjusted returns.
- **Governance Collateral** – Delegators stake DCT to participate in parameter
  updates, treasury proposals, and compliance policies.
- **Network Credits** – Protocol services such as strategy backtesting, API
  calls, and bot orchestration consume DCT as metered credits.

## Governance

Dynamic Capital Governance (DCG) is a two-house model combining token-weighted
voting with contributor councils:

1. **Token Assembly** – DCT holders delegate voting power to representatives who
   vote on parameter changes, treasury distributions, and product roadmaps.
2. **Contributor Council** – Technical and risk experts review proposals for
   compliance and soundness before escalating to the Token Assembly.

Governance proposals flow through ideation, temperature check, and on-chain
voting stages. Quorum thresholds scale with the total DCT staked in governance
contracts, ensuring that participation grows alongside protocol adoption.

## Treasury Management

The treasury safeguards protocol runway, liquidity provisioning, and strategic
partnerships. Capital is diversified across:

- TON-native stable assets to fund operations and grants.
- Yield-generating vaults with conservative risk scores.
- Liquidity positions backing DCT trading pairs.

Treasury deployments require dual approval from the Contributor Council and
Token Assembly. Reporting dashboards publish monthly transparency updates
detailing inflows, outflows, and performance.

## Compliance & Risk Controls

Dynamic Capital integrates programmatic KYC/KYB checks for institutional
participants while preserving permissionless access for compliant geographies.
Smart contracts undergo independent security audits and continuous monitoring
for anomaly detection. Risk parameters (leverage caps, vault concentration
limits, circuit breakers) are enforced on-chain to protect against systemic
shocks.

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 – Liquidity Bootstrap**: Launch staking tiers, governance portal,
   and market-making incentives for TON DEX pairs.
2. **Phase 2 – Intelligence Expansion**: Release AI trading copilots,
   cross-venue order routing, and dynamic risk dashboards.
3. **Phase 3 – Institutional Onboarding**: Integrate custodial partners,
   structured products, and compliance tooling for regulated entities.
4. **Phase 4 – Cross-Chain Utility**: Extend DCT utility to EVM bridges and L2
   ecosystems with unified staking and fee credits.

## Conclusion

Dynamic Capital TON Coin is the coordination layer connecting intelligence,
liquidity, and governance across the Dynamic Capital stack. The token aligns
incentives for contributors and capital providers while maintaining strict risk
oversight. By combining programmable emissions, utility-driven demand, and
transparent governance, DCT is positioned to catalyze sustainable growth of the
Dynamic Capital ecosystem.
