# Engine Synchronization Overview

This document summarises the coordination patterns used across the Dynamic Capital codebase when different AI engines or infrastructural services need to stay in lockstep. It builds on the behaviours encoded in orchestrator modules such as `DynamicUsageOrchestrator` and `DynamicSyncronizationOrchestrator`.

## 1. Training Engines

Machine learning training clusters coordinate by sharing gradient updates so that distributed workers converge on identical parameters.

- **Technique:** AllReduce-style gradient aggregation through the training scheduler.
- **Implementation touchpoint:** Within the `dynamic_engines` registry, training executors register common gradient handlers so replica workers reuse identical optimiser state.

## 2. Reasoning + Execution Engines

Reasoning components (e.g., language models, planners) collaborate with tool-execution runtimes by exchanging structured context.

- **Shared Memory:** Persona profiles and workspace metadata are staged by `DynamicUsageOrchestrator` before tasks are handed off, ensuring each reasoning cycle sees the same prompt state.
- **State Handover:** Execution traces are stored in the assignment registry, allowing downstream tool invocations to load prior outputs without recomputing them.

## 3. Multi-Agent / Multi-Engine Systems

Specialised agents (vision, planning, trading, etc.) communicate through orchestration hubs.

- **Message Passing:** Zones and spaces use message queues to emit JSON events so sibling agents can subscribe to upstream state transitions.
- **Consensus:** Voting utilities in the assignment engine reconcile conflicting recommendations, producing a single directive for downstream executors.

## 4. Real-Time Engines

Systems that mirror external environments—such as markets or robotics feeds—rely on consistent timing.

- **Time Coordination:** Tick controllers align incoming events to an internal clock so derived analytics maintain chronological order.
- **Predictive Sync:** Latency buffers smooth delayed telemetry, letting controllers interpolate likely states until definitive data arrives.

## 5. Infrastructure Synchronization

The `DynamicSyncronizationOrchestrator` records shared definitions about data pipelines, dependencies, and operational incidents.

- **System Registry:** `SyncSystem` entries capture cadence, tolerance, and criticality for each synchronised dataset.
- **Dependency Graph:** `SyncDependency` models upstream/downstream impact, enabling risk propagation when a source lags.
- **Event Log:** `SyncEvent` normalises status, drift, and latency, letting health dashboards compute trend metrics with consistent units.
- **Incident Tracking:** `SyncIncident` stores severity-weighted outages so responders can prioritise remediation across the network.

Together these layers ensure training, reasoning, multi-agent collaboration, real-time controllers, and infrastructure services work from an aligned view of the world.
