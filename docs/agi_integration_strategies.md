# AGI-Driven Trading Integration Strategy

## Overview

This playbook codifies how Dynamic Capital can fuse Dynamic Trading Logic (DTL),
the Dynamic Trading Algo (DTA), and emerging AGI agents into a single adaptive
operating model. The goal is to ship explainable decisions, preserve risk
discipline, and continuously upgrade performance without interrupting live
desks. Each section maps the requested capabilities to concrete architecture
notes, operational checklists, and learning loops that fit the existing
TradingView → Supabase → MT5 stack.

Use the numbered subsections as implementation trackers. When an initiative
moves from design to delivery, capture the owner, start date, and completion
signal directly under the relevant bullet point. This keeps engineering,
trading, and treasury teams synchronized as AGI scope expands.

## 1. AGI Integration Strategies

### 1.1 Modular Agent Mediation Between DTL and DTA

- **Mediator Layer:** Introduce a lightweight "Strategy Router" agent that
  consumes DTL hypothesis outputs and DTA execution readiness signals. The
  router arbitrates conflicts via configurable policies (e.g., risk budget,
  latency budget) and emits normalized intent envelopes to downstream execution.
- **Interface Contracts:**
  - DTL publishes to `signals.hypothesis.v1` with probability, supporting
    evidence, and required execution window.
  - DTA responds on `signals.health.v1` with fill confidence, current throttle
    limits, and outstanding debt to risk.
  - Mediation logic persists rationale snapshots to Supabase
    `strategy_rationales` for auditability.
- **Hot-Swap Capability:** Package mediation logic inside a containerized
  service (FastAPI or Deno) with feature flags so alternate policies can be
  shadow-tested alongside production without downtime.

### 1.2 Role-Based AGI Personas

- **Strategy Analyst (DTL Advocate):** Specializes in hypothesis generation,
  signal clustering, and alignment with Smart Money Concepts (SMC). Runs
  exploratory notebooks, updates glossary alignment, and proposes mitigation
  adjustments.
- **Execution Overseer (DTA Guardian):** Focuses on venue selection, order
  slicing, and adaptive throttles. Owns latency dashboards, broker KPIs, and
  slippage simulations.
- **Risk Sentinel (Policy Authority):** Maintains guardrails across leverage,
  exposure, and treasury allocations. Approves kill-switch triggers and
  consensus gating outcomes before live routing.
- **Coordination Rituals:** Implement weekly persona syncs using the Agent
  Canvas template (`docs/multi_agent_trading_architecture.md`) to highlight
  experiments, blocked dependencies, and telemetry observations.

### 1.3 Signal Normalization & Rationale Scoring

- **Normalization Pipeline:**
  - Step 1: Raw alerts or discretionary notes enter a Kafka topic
    `signals.raw.v1`.
  - Step 2: A Deno task cleans timestamps, session tags, and symbol metadata,
    then stores canonical records in Supabase `signals_normalized`.
  - Step 3: An AGI "Rationale Scorer" ranks each signal 0–1 across SMC
    confluence, volatility regime fit, and counter-party flow alignment.
- **Explainability Artifacts:** Archive rationale vectors alongside textual
  justifications (top 3 contributing features, conflicting signals, precedent
  trades) to allow auditors and community members to inspect reasoning quality.
- **Escalation Hooks:** When rationale confidence drops below configurable
  thresholds, push notifications to the Strategy Analyst persona and queue the
  signal for manual review before any order leaves the router.

## 2. Execution Optimization

### 2.1 AGI-Driven Broker Routing

- Build an agent that tracks broker metrics (spread, liquidity depth, rejection
  rate) in near real time. Feed features into a contextual bandit that selects
  the optimal venue per symbol while respecting counterparty concentration
  limits.
- Integrate slippage prediction models (gradient boosted trees or lightweight
  transformers) that ingest order book snapshots, historical fills, and latency
  traces to forecast expected vs. worst-case outcomes.

### 2.2 Latency-Aware Order Placement

- Maintain latency baselines per venue, route, and order type in ClickHouse or
  TimescaleDB. The Execution Overseer persona tunes timeouts and child order
  slicing windows using these baselines.
- Allow AGI to tag each intent with a `latency_class` (e.g., immediate, defer,
  park) so the router can choose between direct market access, smart order
  routing, or iceberg style placements.

### 2.3 Adaptive Lot Sizing

- Blend real-time volatility metrics (ATR, realized variance) with AGI-provided
  confidence intervals to adjust lot sizes dynamically.
- Impose treasury-aware caps by integrating with the capital allocation service
  (see Section 4.3) to avoid violating cash buffers or tokenomics triggers.

### 2.4 Shadow Deployments & Consensus Gating

- Deploy new execution policies in "shadow" mode: orders are simulated
  end-to-end with identical market data but held from live venues. Compare
  shadow vs. production slippage to determine promotion readiness.
- Require a quorum (e.g., 2 of 3 personas + automated risk checks) before
  toggling shadow policies live. Record votes and rationale in Supabase for
  compliance traceability.

## 3. Logic Enhancement

### 3.1 Multi-LLM Ensemble Benchmarking

- Run ensembles across diverse LLM families (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-weight
  models) to benchmark SMC interpretations, structural bias calls, and macro
  overlay commentary.
- Use evaluation harnesses that score reasoning chains for consistency,
  factuality, and alignment with glossary definitions. Persist evaluation
  metrics per model to inform routing.

### 3.2 Smart Money Concepts Validation

- Automate BOS/SMS, liquidity sweep, and mitigation block detection with
  cross-model voting. Require majority agreement plus quantitative confirmation
  (volume delta, imbalance thresholds) before flagging high conviction trades.
- Introduce anomaly detection (e.g., isolation forests) to surface
  out-of-pattern market structures for human analysts and AGI review.

### 3.3 Feedback Injection

- After every execution cycle, feed realized PnL, slippage, and compliance notes
  back into the rationale scorer. Update feature weights so recurring execution
  issues penalize aggressive entries and reward disciplined exits.
- Maintain a "decision delta" log that pairs predicted outcomes with actual
  results for reinforcement learning fine-tuning.

## 4. Feedback Loop Design

### 4.1 Closed-Loop Telemetry

- Establish a unified telemetry fabric that mirrors events across TradingView,
  MT5, Exness, and AGI agent outputs. Utilize OpenTelemetry collectors to
  fan-out traces into Prometheus (metrics) and ClickHouse (analytics).
- Normalize identifiers (order ID, signal ID, hypothesis ID) so cross-platform
  drilldowns remain coherent.

### 4.2 Retrospective Auto-Tuning

- Schedule retrospectives where AGI agents propose modifier adjustments (e.g.,
  raise mitigation weights, tighten execution throttles) based on telemetry
  anomalies.
- Use Supabase stored procedures or Edge Functions to apply approved modifier
  changes and log before/after configurations for audit.

### 4.3 Treasury Synchronization

- Sync treasury positions, cash buffers, and token issuance windows with
  execution throttles by subscribing AGI agents to `treasury.status.v1` events.
- Link DCT pricing levers to strategy conviction: when AGI confidence is high
  and risk budgets are underutilized, trigger optional buy-back or minting
  workflows as defined in `docs/dct-dynamic-market-maker.md`.

## 5. Continuous Learning

### 5.1 Reinforcement Learning on Trade Outcomes

- Configure RL pipelines (RLlib or custom PyTorch) that treat strategy intents
  as actions and realized outcomes as rewards. Incorporate penalty terms for
  rule breaches, latency overruns, and compliance flags.
- Run offline training on historical executions before live experimentation;
  promote policies only after they outperform baselines with statistical
  confidence.

### 5.2 Mentorship & Community Feedback

- Score mentorship touchpoints and community trade breakdowns using AGI
  evaluators. Metrics should cover accuracy, conviction clarity, and adherence
  to approved vocabulary.
- Feed high-scoring community insights back into DTL backlog grooming to
  encourage distributed intelligence contributions.

### 5.3 Intelligence Oracle & Tokenomics Triggers

- Integrate with the Intelligence Oracle so that agent-generated insights can
  nudge tokenomics actions (e.g., staking rate changes, incentive pool unlocks).
- Define trigger thresholds (confidence %, win-rate delta, treasury coverage)
  that automatically notify treasury operators when Oracle metrics warrant
  governance review.
