## Dynamic AGI — 9 Capability Lanes

**Dynamic Core Hollow (DCH)**

1. **DCH1 — Natural Language Processing:** Comprehension and language modeling.
2. **DCH2 — Strategic Planning:** Long-horizon goal setting and optimization.
3. **DCH3 — Problem Solving:** Structured, multi-step reasoning.
4. **DCH4 — Knowledge Synthesis:** Integrates research into unified briefs.
5. **DCH5 — Creative Generation:** Produces novel ideas and strategies.

cloud adapter—both options are part of the constructor-level wiring for the AGI
runtime.【F:dynamic/intelligence/agi/model.py†L68-L356】

## Dynamic AGS — 5 Governance Pillars

**Dynamic Core Revenant (DCR)**

1. **DCR1 — Governance:** Policy enforcement, compliance monitoring, and audit
   trails.
2. **DCR2 — Sync:** Temporal coordination and data/process alignment.
3. **DCR3 — Memory:** Knowledge retention, task journaling, and state
   management.
4. **DCR4 — Observability:** Metrics, logs, traces, and evaluation telemetry.
5. **DCR5 — Reliability:** Resilience engineering, failover, and incident
   response.

**Language model backing.** AGS leans on an LLM-as-judge critic pattern for
policy scoring and rollback decisions, with operational runbooks calling for
fallback to smaller, faster models whenever a primary governance review model
times out—prioritising reliability over naming a single canonical
checkpoint.【F:docs/dynamic-ags-playbook.md†L155-L183】
