# NPM Dependency Audit â€” 2025-10-13

## Summary

- **Command:** `npm run audit`
- **Node version:** `v20.19.4`
- **Result:** npm reported zero known vulnerabilities across dependencies.
- **Warnings:** npm emitted `Unknown env config "http-proxy"` during the run; this flag will stop working in a future npm major release.

## Command Output

```bash
$ npm run audit
npm warn Unknown env config "http-proxy". This will stop working in the next major version of npm.
> audit
> npm audit
npm warn Unknown env config "http-proxy". This will stop working in the next major version of npm.
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

## Follow-up Recommendations

1. **Update npm configuration:** Replace or remove the deprecated `http-proxy` environment entry before the next npm major release to keep audit pipelines healthy.
   - Owners: Platform Engineering + SecOps.
   - Actions: Remove legacy proxy entry from `.npmrc`, confirm traffic routes through supported proxies, validate no build scripts rely on the deprecated setting.
   - Target Date: 2025-10-20.
2. **Automate recurring audits:** Schedule `npm run audit` as part of nightly quality gates and major release cutovers to detect upstream regressions quickly.
   - Actions: Wire command into CI workflow, store JSON output artifacts for traceability, and configure alerts on non-zero findings.
3. **Surface results to stakeholders:** Log audit status in the release dashboard referenced in the Dynamic UI/UX remediation plan to maintain traceability across domains.
   - Actions: Publish audit summary and remediation status in the weekly governance report; link to dependency backlog tickets when vulnerabilities emerge.
