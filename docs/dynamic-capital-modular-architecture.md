# Dynamic Capital Modular Architecture

## 1. Dynamic Foundation Layer — Protocol & Identity

- **Governance & Ethics Module**: Establishes transparent governance, codifies
  Maldivian cultural branding, and enforces an adaptive code of ethics for every
  protocol participant.
- **Tokenomics & Smart Contracts**: Automates DCT burn/buyback cycles, staking
  incentives, and dynamic pricing logic through audited smart contracts.
- **Identity & Access Control**: Verifies wallets, anchors mentorship
  credentials through an NFT/ASCII pipeline, and orchestrates secure onboarding
  workflows.

## 2. Dynamic Intelligence Layer — Classes & Models

- **Agent Classes (Blueprints)**: Defines reusable agent archetypes that
  standardize capabilities, context windows, and collaboration protocols.
- **Models (Trained Intelligence)**: Hosts multilingual (Dhivehi + global)
  prediction, scoring, and decision models that are continuously fine-tuned.
- **Feedback Loops**: Measures model accuracy, mentorship quality, and community
  engagement to drive automated retraining and incentive adjustments.

## 3. Dynamic Execution Layer — Engines

- **Inference Engine**: Executes AI/ML workloads across PyTorch, TensorRT, and
  hybrid quantum runtimes for low-latency decisioning.
- **Smart Contract Engine**: Operates governance, tokenomics, and automation
  logic natively on TON infrastructure.
- **Simulation Engine**: Enables backtesting, scenario modeling, and stress
  testing for strategies before on-chain deployment.

## 4. Dynamic Interface Layer — Applications

- **Telegram Bot & Mini App**: Manages onboarding, facilitates payments,
  delivers mentorship signals, and supports community dialogue.
- **Static Site + GUI**: Provides Next.js/React/Tailwind dashboards synchronized
  with the mini app to expose analytics and controls.
- **TradingView Integration**: Streams signals, overlays strategies, and
  visualizes performance data within TradingView.

## 5. Dynamic Resonance Layer — Synchronization

- **AGI Intelligence Oracle**: Scores performance in real time, triggers token
  burns, and calibrates service pricing based on ecosystem demand.
- **Cosmic Resonance Map**: Encodes intelligence growth across wavelengths,
  amplitude, and phase to align strategic priorities.
- **Biological & Energy-Aware Modules**: Embeds sustainability metrics,
  regenerative design principles, and adaptive scaling heuristics.

## 6. Dynamic Deployment Layer — Instances

- **Live Agents**: Deploys specialized bots for mentorship, trading execution,
  and governance facilitation.
- **Community Nodes**: Coordinates distributed contributors who operate modular
  services and extend network resilience.
- **Ecosystem Services**: Delivers education, market signals, and mentorship in
  real time to stakeholders.

## Flow Summary

Dynamic blueprint → Dynamic model (trained intelligence) → Dynamic engine
(execution runtime) → Dynamic instance (live deployment), all synchronized by
the AGI Intelligence Oracle and harmonized through cosmic and biological
resonance metaphors.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Stand up governance, tokenomics, and identity modules within the Dynamic
      Foundation Layer with audited smart contracts and wallet onboarding flows.
- [ ] Deploy agent archetypes, multilingual intelligence models, and automated
      feedback loops across the Dynamic Intelligence Layer.
- [ ] Provision inference, smart contract, and simulation engines with the
      required compute accelerators in the Dynamic Execution Layer.
- [ ] Launch user-facing Telegram, web, and TradingView applications aligned
      with the Dynamic Interface Layer specifications.
- [ ] Activate live agents, community nodes, and ecosystem service pipelines in
      the Dynamic Deployment Layer.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Verify governance transparency, DCT tokenomics behaviors, and identity
      controls in staging prior to mainnet activation.
- [ ] Validate predictive, scoring, and mentorship models for accuracy,
      multilingual coverage, and bias mitigation.
- [ ] Confirm runtime performance targets for inference, on-chain automation,
      and simulation stress testing.
- [ ] Test cross-platform user experience and payment flows across Telegram, web
      dashboards, and TradingView integrations.
- [ ] Monitor oracle-driven resonance metrics to ensure token burns, pricing
      adjustments, and sustainability safeguards fire as designed.
