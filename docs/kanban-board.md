# Dynamic AI (DAI) Kanban Board

The Dynamic AI program tracks work across five epics using a Kanban workflow. Cards move strictly from **Backlog** → **To Do (Sprint)** → **In Progress** → **Review / Testing** → **Done**.

## Columns
- **Backlog** – Ideas and unstarted initiatives.
- **To Do (Sprint)** – Tasks committed for the active sprint.
- **In Progress** – Tasks currently being executed.
- **Review / Testing** – Pull requests open for review or items running through validation environments.
- **Done** – Work merged, deployed, and validated in production.

## Workflow Rules
- Cards must progress left to right; no skipping stages.

- Weekly sprint planning moves top-priority cards from **Backlog** to **To Do**.
- Standups focus on the **In Progress** column to unblock work.
