# Document Navigation Optimization Guide

Design professional documents that readers can scan quickly by coordinating page
numbering, table of contents (TOC) entries, and header/footer cues. Follow the
quick workflow below, then reference the component playbooks for deeper detail.

## Quick Start Workflow

1. **Map the document.** Mark which pages live in the front matter, the main
   body, and supporting appendices.
2. **Split sections.** Insert section breaks so front matter, chapters, and
   appendices can use unique numbering or header/footer content.
3. **Apply numbering styles.** Assign Roman numerals to front matter, Arabic to
   the main body, and decide whether numbering is continuous or chapter-based.
4. **Regenerate navigation aids.** Refresh the TOC and any figure/table lists so
   page references match the new layout.
5. **Audit headers/footers.** Confirm they display identity information in the
   header and navigation details in the footer.
6. **Run the final QA checklist.** Verify numbering, TOC links, citations, and
   exports before sharing the document.

| Element               | Core purpose                    | What to include                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Page numbering**    | Organizes the document sequence | Roman numerals for front matter, Arabic for content,    |
|                       |                                 | continuous or section-based numbering as required       |
| **Table of contents** | Guides navigation to each       | Headings with correct hierarchy, optional lists for     |

## Page Numbering Playbook

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario                                  | Recommended action                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Academic paper with front matter          | Use Roman numerals (`i, ii, iii`) for front matter, Arabic from intro   |
| Regulatory or technical report            | Enable continuous numbering across the document                         |
| Training manual or standalone chapters    | Restart numbering per section (e.g., each chapter starts at 1)          |
| Appendix inherits numbering from chapters | Continue numbering to show appendices belong to the preceding chapter   |

### Checklist and Execution Steps

- [ ] **Create section breaks** between front matter, main body, and appendices.
  1. Place the cursor where the numbering style changes and insert a `Next Page`
     section break.
  2. Turn off *Link to Previous* in headers and footers where numbering must
     differ.
- [ ] **Assign Roman numerals to front matter.**
  1. Open the page-number formatting dialog and choose `i, ii, iii`.
  2. Set the starting value to `i` and apply the format to the current section
     only.
- [ ] **Switch to Arabic numerals for the main body.**
  1. Position the cursor on the first page of the introduction.
  2. Format page numbers as Arabic (`1, 2, 3`) and set the starting value to `1`.
- [ ] **Choose continuous or section-based numbering.**
  1. Confirm stakeholder or publication requirements.
  2. Select *Continue from previous section* for continuous numbering or
     *Restart at 1* for chapter-based numbering.
  3. Scroll through each section break to confirm behavior.
- [ ] **Verify headers/footers reflect numeral style changes.**
  1. Review headers and footers after every section break.
  2. Update fields that inherited the wrong numeral format.

> **Tip:** Academic templates often start Arabic numbering at the introduction
> while keeping front matter in Roman numerals. Use section breaks to isolate the
> numbering styles.

## Table of Contents Playbook

### Types and Levels

- **Automatic TOC** — generated by word processors (Word, Google Docs, LaTeX).
- **Manual TOC** — typed manually for short documents or when automation fails.
- **Hierarchy** — include Heading 1 items as primary entries, Heading 2/3 for
  subsections, and optional lists for figures, tables, or abbreviations.

### Checklist and Execution Steps

- [ ] **Apply heading styles.**
  1. Format each major section with Heading 1 and subsections with Heading 2/3.
  2. Confirm headings are consistent so the automatic TOC can recognize them.
- [ ] **Insert or refresh the TOC.**
  1. Use the built-in TOC generator and choose a layout that fits the document.
  2. Right-click the TOC and select *Update Field → Update Entire Table* after
     structural edits.
- [ ] **Add optional lists when needed.**
  1. Caption figures and tables so they populate the related lists.
  2. Insert automatic lists or manually create a concise table when automation is
     unavailable.
- [ ] **Revalidate pagination after layout changes.**
  1. Preview the document (print or PDF) to verify page numbers.
  2. Update manual TOCs by editing page numbers directly if automation is not in
     use.

## Headers and Footers Playbook

### Core Principles

- Headers communicate **identity** (document title, chapter name, author,
  institution).
- Footers provide **navigation** (page numbers, revision date, optional
  footnotes).
- Double-sided documents often use mirrored layouts: outer edges display page
  numbers while inner edges reserve space for binding.

### Checklist and Execution Steps

- [ ] **Insert identity details in the header.**
  1. Activate the header area and add the document title or current heading.
  2. Apply styles that match branding or academic guidelines.
- [ ] **Include author or institution fields when required.**
  1. Determine whether every header needs attribution.
  2. Use *Link to Previous* to replicate fields across identical sections and
     disable it where headers must change.
- [ ] **Place page numbers and navigation aids in the footer.**
  1. Insert page numbers and align them per the style guide (centered, left, or
     right).
  2. Confirm the numeral style matches the current section's formatting.
- [ ] **Add optional dates or footnotes judiciously.**
  1. Include revision dates or footnotes only when they add value.
  2. Keep the footer uncluttered so page numbers remain prominent.
- [ ] **Mirror layouts for duplex printing.**
  1. Enable *Different Odd & Even Pages* when printing double-sided.
  2. Adjust inner margins for binding notes and outer margins for navigation.
- [ ] **Reset headers/footers at section breaks.**
  1. Verify each new chapter header updates while the footer stays consistent.
  2. Break unwanted links to previous sections.

## Integration Map

Use the matrix below to keep navigation artifacts synchronized while drafting.

| From → To             | Coordination task                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overview → TOC        | Align promises in the overview with TOC entries so reviewers find them.|
| Summary → Analysis    | Cite sections that expand on summary insights and confirm pagination.   |
| TOC → Analysis        | Ensure every analysis heading appears in the TOC at the correct level. |
| Analysis → References | Match in-text citations to reference entries and numbering schemes.     |
| References → Index    | Use consistent terminology so index entries point to cited sections.    |
| Headers/Footers → Navigation | Pair headers for identity with footers for location awareness.  |
| QA Evidence → Grading | Capture PDFs or screenshots showing numbering and TOC accuracy.        |

## Final QA Checklist

Follow this sequence before delivering the document.

- [ ] Front matter precedes the TOC and uses Roman numerals.
- [ ] Section order matches the expected structure (overview → analysis →
      references → appendices).
- [ ] TOC and optional lists are regenerated or manually corrected.
- [ ] Headers and footers remain accurate across every section break.
- [ ] Citations and index entries resolve to the right pages.
- [ ] A PDF or print preview confirms numbering, TOC links, and navigation cues.

## Example Professional Report Structure

1. Cover page
2. Acknowledgments *(Roman i)*
3. Abstract or summary *(Roman ii)*
4. Table of contents *(Roman iii)*
5. List of figures and tables *(Roman iv)*
6. Introduction *(Arabic 1)*
7. Main body (analysis, findings, discussion)
8. Conclusion and recommendations
9. References or bibliography
10. Index
11. Appendices

**Navigation cues**

- Headers can display the report title (e.g., “Report on Renewable Energy”).
- Footers typically show centered page numbers with optional footnotes or dates.

By coordinating numbering, TOCs, and navigation aids, you deliver a polished
document that stays consistent from drafting through grading or stakeholder
review.
