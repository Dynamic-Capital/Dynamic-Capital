# Page Numbering, Table of Contents, and Page Navigation Guide

This guide summarizes best practices for professional documents, focusing on
page numbering, table of contents creation, and the consistent use of headers
and footers.

## Quick Implementation Workflow

Use the following high-level runbook before diving into the detailed checklists.
Each step links to a deeper section in this guide.

1. **Audit the document sections.** Identify which pages belong in the front
   matter, the main body, and supporting materials so that page numbering rules
   can be applied correctly.
2. **Configure page numbering styles.** Apply Roman numerals to the front matter
   and Arabic numerals to the main body, choosing continuous or section-based
   numbering as required.
3. **Build or refresh the TOC.** Generate or update the table of contents to
   reflect the latest headings and ensure numbering alignment.
4. **Standardize headers and footers.** Populate the header with identity
   information and the footer with navigation aids such as page numbers or
   notes.
5. **Run a navigation review.** Walk through the final review checklist to
   confirm numbering, TOC links, and navigation cues all match the finished
   document.

## Page Numbering Strategies

- **Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, …)**
  - Ideal for front matter such as abstracts, acknowledgments, and the table of
    contents.
- **Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, …)**
  - Used for the main body starting with the introduction or first chapter.
- **Continuous numbering**
  - Page numbers run sequentially across the entire document.
- **Section-based numbering**
  - Page numbering restarts for each chapter or section.
- **Academic tip**
  - Many academic papers begin Arabic numbering at the introduction while
    keeping front matter in Roman numerals.

### Page Numbering Checklist

- [ ] Assign Roman numerals to all front-matter sections (acknowledgments,
      abstract, TOC, lists of figures/tables).
- [ ] Begin Arabic numerals at the introduction or first chapter.
- [ ] Confirm that continuous or section-based numbering matches stakeholder or
      publication requirements.
- [ ] Verify headers and footers display the correct numeral style for each
      section break.

## Table of Contents (TOC)

The TOC acts as the map of your document and should list the major sections
alongside their page numbers.

### TOC Types

- **Automatic TOC**
  - Generated by word processors such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LaTeX.
- **Manual TOC**
  - Curated by hand, usually reserved for shorter documents or when automation
    is unavailable.

### TOC Levels

- **Main headings**
  - Chapters or primary sections.
- **Subheadings**
  - Sub-sections, appendices, or nested topics.
- **Optional lists**
  - Figures, tables, and abbreviations when relevant.

### TOC Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Capture all top-level sections (chapters, major headings) in the TOC.
- [ ] Include relevant subheadings for deeper navigation where helpful.
- [ ] Insert optional lists for figures, tables, or abbreviations when the
      document includes them.
- [ ] Update page numbers automatically or re-check manual entries after layout
      changes.

## Headers and Footers

Headers and footers appear on every page and provide identity and navigation
cues.

- **Typical header content**
  - Document title or current chapter, author name, or institutional
    affiliation.
- **Typical footer content**
  - Page numbers, publication date, and footnotes with references or explanatory
    notes.
- **Professional writing guideline**
  - Treat the header as the document identity and the footer as the navigation
    anchor.

### Header and Footer Checklist

- [ ] Display the document title, chapter, or section name in the header.
- [ ] Include author or institution details if required by the format or
      audience.
- [ ] Place page numbers in the footer, centered or aligned per style guide.
- [ ] Add footnotes or publication dates only when necessary to avoid clutter.

## Placement within a Document

- **Overview**
  - Appears before the table of contents to introduce the document.
- **Summary or abstract**
  - Placed in the front matter, commonly before or immediately after the TOC.
- **Main body**
  - Contains analysis, findings, and discussion structured according to the TOC.
- **Referencing and index**
  - Located at the end of the document after the main content.
- **Headers and footers**
  - Applied consistently across the entire document for continuity.

### Final Review Checklist

- [ ] Confirm that the front matter precedes the TOC and uses Roman numerals.
- [ ] Ensure the summary, analysis, references, and index appear in the order
      outlined below.
- [ ] Scan the document to confirm headers and footers remain consistent across
      section breaks.
- [ ] Perform a final pass to ensure TOC entries match the document structure
      and page numbering.

## Example Professional Report Structure

1. Cover page
2. Acknowledgments (Roman i)
3. Abstract or summary (Roman ii)
4. Table of contents (Roman iii)
5. List of figures and tables (Roman iv)
6. Introduction (Arabic 1)
7. Main body (analysis, findings, discussion)
8. Conclusion and recommendations
9. References or bibliography
10. Index
11. Appendices

**Navigation cues**

- Headers might display the report title (e.g., “Report on Renewable Energy”).
- Footers typically show centered page numbers and optional footnotes.

By aligning page numbering, TOCs, and navigation elements, documents remain
professional, readable, and easy to grade or review.
