# Page Numbering, Table of Contents, and Page Navigation Guide

This guide summarizes best practices for professional documents, focusing on
page numbering, table of contents creation, and the consistent use of headers
and footers.

## Quick Implementation Workflow

Use the following high-level runbook before diving into the detailed checklists.
Each step links to a deeper section in this guide.

1. **Audit the document sections.** Identify which pages belong in the front
   matter, the main body, and supporting materials so that page numbering rules
   can be applied correctly.
2. **Configure page numbering styles.** Apply Roman numerals to the front matter
   and Arabic numerals to the main body, choosing continuous or section-based
   numbering as required.
3. **Build or refresh the TOC.** Generate or update the table of contents to
   reflect the latest headings and ensure numbering alignment.
4. **Standardize headers and footers.** Populate the header with identity
   information and the footer with navigation aids such as page numbers or
   notes.
5. **Run a navigation review.** Walk through the final review checklist to
   confirm numbering, TOC links, and navigation cues all match the finished
   document.

## Page Numbering Strategies

| Numbering style                    | Where to use it                                                                  | Configuration notes                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, …)** | Front matter (acknowledgments, abstract, TOC, lists of figures/tables)           | Set the start number to `i` and enable separate headers/footers so the style does not bleed into the main body.                 |
| **Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, …)**   | Main body (introduction through appendices)                                      | Start at `1` when the main body begins—usually the introduction—and confirm the style is locked for the remaining sections.     |
| **Continuous numbering**           | Regulatory reports or long-form deliverables that need a single reference stream | Configure the page-numbering dialog to “Continue from previous section” so each break inherits the latest value.                |
| **Section-based numbering**        | Training manuals or textbooks where each chapter stands alone                    | Enable “Restart each section” and confirm that chapters with appendices still follow the parent chapter’s numbering convention. |

> **Academic tip:** Many academic papers begin Arabic numbering at the
> introduction while keeping front matter in Roman numerals. Add a section break
> between the front matter and the first chapter so the numbering styles stay
> isolated.

### Page Numbering Checklist

- [ ] Assign Roman numerals to all front-matter sections (acknowledgments,
      abstract, TOC, lists of figures/tables).
- [ ] Begin Arabic numerals at the introduction or first chapter.
- [ ] Confirm that continuous or section-based numbering matches stakeholder or
      publication requirements.
- [ ] Verify headers and footers display the correct numeral style for each
      section break.

## Table of Contents (TOC)

The TOC acts as the map of your document and should list the major sections
alongside their page numbers. Decide whether the document will live inside a
word processor, PDF export, or web view so you can match the TOC style to the
publishing environment.

### TOC Types

- **Automatic TOC**
  - Generated by word processors such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LaTeX.
- **Manual TOC**
  - Curated by hand, usually reserved for shorter documents or when automation
    is unavailable.

### TOC Levels

- **Main headings**
  - Chapters or primary sections.
- **Subheadings**
  - Sub-sections, appendices, or nested topics.
- **Optional lists**
  - Figures, tables, and abbreviations when relevant.

### TOC Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Capture all top-level sections (chapters, major headings) in the TOC.
- [ ] Include relevant subheadings for deeper navigation where helpful.
- [ ] Insert optional lists for figures, tables, or abbreviations when the
      document includes them.
- [ ] Update page numbers automatically or re-check manual entries after layout
      changes.

## Headers and Footers

Headers and footers appear on every page and provide identity and navigation
cues.

- **Typical header content**
  - Document title or current chapter, author name, or institutional
    affiliation.
- **Typical footer content**
  - Page numbers, publication date, and footnotes with references or explanatory
    notes.
- **Professional writing guideline**
  - Treat the header as the document identity and the footer as the navigation
    anchor.

### Header and Footer Checklist

- [ ] Display the document title, chapter, or section name in the header.
- [ ] Include author or institution details if required by the format or
      audience.
- [ ] Place page numbers in the footer, centered or aligned per style guide.
- [ ] Add footnotes or publication dates only when necessary to avoid clutter.
- [ ] Confirm odd/even pages use mirrored layouts when printing double-sided
      reports.
- [ ] Verify section breaks reset header/footer content appropriately (e.g.,
      chapter name updates while the document title remains consistent).

## Placement within a Document

- **Overview**
  - Appears before the table of contents to introduce the document.
- **Summary or abstract**
  - Placed in the front matter, commonly before or immediately after the TOC.
- **Main body**
  - Contains analysis, findings, discussion, and evidence structured according
    to the TOC entries.
- **Referencing and index**
  - Located at the end of the document after the main content and appendices.
- **Grading or scoring rubrics**
  - Often reference proper numbering, TOC accuracy, and navigation clarity—keep
    supporting evidence (screenshots or PDF exports) with submissions.
- **Headers and footers**
  - Applied consistently across the entire document for continuity.

## Document Element Interactions

Use this reference to keep navigation artifacts aligned while you draft or edit
the report.

- **Overview → TOC**
  - Link the overview’s promises to TOC entries so reviewers can jump to the
    relevant sections.
- **Summary or abstract → Main body**
  - Ensure summary insights cite the sections that expand on them. Cross-check
    page numbers after layout changes.
- **TOC → Analysis sections**
  - Every heading in the analysis must appear in the TOC at the appropriate
    level; regenerate automatic TOCs after structural edits.
- **Analysis → Referencing**
  - Footnotes and in-text citations must map to the reference list and share the
    correct numbering or identifier system.
- **Referencing → Index**
  - Use consistent terminology so the index can point readers to both analysis
    sections and citation details.
- **Headers/footers → Navigation cues**
  - Pair the header (identity) and footer (page number/notes) so readers always
    know where they are in the document.
- **Grading or scoring → Evidence packet**
  - Capture PDF exports or screenshots of numbering, TOC, and navigation
    elements to satisfy academic or professional review requirements.

### Final Review Checklist

- [ ] Confirm that the front matter precedes the TOC and uses Roman numerals.
- [ ] Ensure the summary, analysis, references, index, and appendices appear in
      the order outlined below.
- [ ] Regenerate automatic TOCs or update manual entries after any content
      changes.
- [ ] Scan the document to confirm headers and footers remain consistent across
      section breaks.
- [ ] Verify that in-text citations align with the reference list and the index
      anchors point to the correct pages.
- [ ] Capture an export (PDF or print preview) that demonstrates numbering and
      navigation accuracy for grading or stakeholder sign-off.

## Example Professional Report Structure

1. Cover page
2. Acknowledgments (Roman i)
3. Abstract or summary (Roman ii)
4. Table of contents (Roman iii)
5. List of figures and tables (Roman iv)
6. Introduction (Arabic 1)
7. Main body (analysis, findings, discussion)
8. Conclusion and recommendations
9. References or bibliography
10. Index
11. Appendices

**Navigation cues**

- Headers might display the report title (e.g., “Report on Renewable Energy”).
- Footers typically show centered page numbers and optional footnotes.

By aligning page numbering, TOCs, and navigation elements, documents remain
professional, readable, and easy to grade or review.
