# Dynamic Capital TON Coin Status Report

## Snapshot

- **Protocol scope:** DCT is the proof-of-contribution asset powering the intelligence, execution, and liquidity layers described in the whitepaper, coupling access to AI-assisted tooling with treasury-aligned incentives.【F:docs/dynamic-capital-ton-whitepaper.md†L7-L46】
- **Supply & treasury controls:** Config manifests enforce the 100 M token cap, 60/30/10 treasury routing with guardrails, staking lock multipliers, and DAO-managed theme pass drops, keeping economics synchronized between on-chain and off-chain systems.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/config.yaml†L1-L49】【F:dynamic-capital-ton/supabase/schema.sql†L41-L74】
- **Contract readiness:** The pool allocator already parses TIP-3 transfers according to spec, forwards the declared TON value, and emits structured deposit events; deployment docs cover the jetton master, wallets, timelocks, and NFT theme passes.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/contracts/pool_allocator.tact†L66-L170】【F:dynamic-capital-ton/contracts/README.md†L1-L88】
- **Application surface:** Telegram Mini App docs outline env setup and verification, while Supabase functions handle wallet linking and subscription intake with credential checks and unit tests guarding typical flows.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/apps/miniapp/README.md†L1-L52】【F:dynamic-capital-ton/supabase/functions/link-wallet/index.ts†L1-L113】【F:dynamic-capital-ton/supabase/functions/process-subscription/index.ts†L1-L158】【F:dynamic-capital-ton/supabase/functions/link-wallet/index.test.ts†L1-L96】
- **Quality focus:** Allocator and Supabase suites provide regression coverage, but the implementation checklist still needs to be updated and routine CI gates documented, as detailed in the technical audit.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/apps/tests/pool_allocator.test.ts†L1-L194】【F:dynamic-capital-ton/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L47-L96】【F:docs/dct-ton-audit.md†L5-L92】
