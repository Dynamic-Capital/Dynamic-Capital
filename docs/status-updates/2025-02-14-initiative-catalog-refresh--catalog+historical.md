# Initiative Snapshot Catalog Refresh â€” 14 Feb 2025

## Summary

- Seeded additional status documents so the `playbook` CLI can surface more than
  one historical checkpoint when teams request initiative summaries.
- Curated entries to highlight governance integration work, giving ritual owners
  concrete references while the snapshot library expands.

## Playbook CLI Notes

- `./playbook --list` now enumerates the refreshed catalog, helping facilitators
  choose between initiative snapshots without opening the filesystem.
- Latest-focused runs still default to the most recent document, ensuring daily
  usage remains a single command while archives grow.
- Section filters remain the recommended way to target desk-specific context
  during prep for trading or governance syncs.

## Follow-Up Actions

1. Backfill at least two historic quarters of initiative summaries to build a
   meaningful trendline for strategic reviews.
2. Add short tags (e.g., `governance`, `trading`, `ai`) to future filenames so
   the CLI's fuzzy matching remains reliable as the catalog scales.
3. Evaluate automating snapshot generation from checklist results to keep the
   library current without manual drafting overhead.
