# Dynamic Capital Initiative Progress — 13 Feb 2025

## Summary

- Executed Dynamic AI and Dynamic AGI validation checklists, exercising the full
  persona, fusion, and oversight regression suites before any orchestration
  updates
  proceed.【5f5071†L1-L17】【3c4987†L1-L8】【8b5e25†L1-L11】【eb586e†L1-L8】
- Re-ran the repository-wide Deno test battery to validate DCT contract logic,
  treasury dispatch adapters, neutral-trade telemetry, and trading workflow
  instrumentation in one
  pass.【54a09f†L1-L9】【bd4f86†L1-L12】【664a18†L1-L40】【b1b710†L1-L8】【4ef9b1†L17-L18】【8c7fc5†L1-L38】
- Reviewed AGS health instrumentation to confirm the `dags-domain-health` probe
  reports mirrored artefacts and governance telemetry, documenting the evidence
  trail for governance desks.【5ad4c5†L1-L44】

## Dynamic Capital Token (DCT)

- The `pool_allocator` suite confirmed deterministic deposit handling, TON
  forward validation, and neutral-trade telemetry emissions, covering timelock,
  liquidity, and payload decoding logic for allocator
  operations.【F:dynamic-capital-ton/apps/tests/pool_allocator.test.ts†L161-L209】【bd4f86†L1-L12】
- Treasury dispatch adapters in `ton-allocator-webhook` validate signatures,
  normalise allocator payloads, and persist structured proofs before triggering
  downstream notifications, keeping treasury settlement loops
  auditable.【F:supabase/functions/ton-allocator-webhook/index.ts†L97-L178】
- DCT automation telemetry remains stable: webhook retry logic exercises burn
  and payment events, ensuring neutral-trade data lands in Supabase even after
  transient
  failures.【F:tests/dct-auto-invest-events.test.ts†L1-L138】【664a18†L33-L40】

## Dynamic Capital AI (DAI)

- Architecture tests passed for pipeline phases, governance guards, and
  telemetry routing, demonstrating that the Brain can safely orchestrate persona
  updates.【e4c75d†L1-L6】【86759d†L1-L8】
- Persona and fusion regressions validated signal chaining, benchmark routing,
  and decision lattice assembly, providing green-light coverage for prompt or
  lobe changes.【3c4987†L1-L8】

## Dynamic AGI (DAGI)

- Oversight tests exercised build CLI tooling, self-improvement loops,
  mentorship feedback, and identity enforcement, confirming telemetry hardening
  workstreams are functioning end-to-end.【8b5e25†L1-L11】【eb586e†L1-L8】

## Dynamic AGS (DAGS)

- The `dags-domain-health` handler asserts table reachability, edge function
  inventory, and OneDrive mirror connectivity while embedding sample manifest
  metadata for smoke tests, giving governance teams a ready probe for quarterly
  audits.【F:supabase/functions/dags-domain-health/index.ts†L1-L44】【F:supabase/functions/_shared/domain-health.ts†L58-L134】

## Dynamic Trading Algo (DTA)

- Buyback automation, Supabase event ingestion, and hedge orchestration tests
  ran successfully, covering rate limits, retry logic, and analytics pipelines
  tied to Smart Money Concepts governance.【664a18†L1-L40】【b1b710†L1-L8】
- The trading signal lifecycle regression verified queue dispatch through RPC
  helpers, ensuring analyzer outputs and execution telemetry remain synchronised
  ahead of new strategy routing.【4ef9b1†L17-L18】

## Dynamic Trading Logic (DTL)

- Signal lifecycle validation and Supabase configuration tests confirmed the
  Strategy Router scaffolding can ingest hypotheses, persist telemetry, and
  expose runtime feature flags needed for reinforcement learning
  experiments.【4ef9b1†L17-L18】【3604†L1-L18】

## Follow-Up Actions

1. Schedule a live Supabase invocation of `dags-domain-health` once production
   credentials are available to capture manifest evidence for the governance
   archive.
2. Continue quarterly liquidity automation pilots by pairing allocator telemetry
   with buyback bot reports, ensuring treasury guardrails hold under higher
   throughput.
3. Feed the passing DAI and DAGI regression artefacts into the shared release
   record so persona and module owners can reference the latest validation cycle
   before shipping updates.
