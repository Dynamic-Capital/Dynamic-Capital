# Governance Ritual Integration â€” 14 Feb 2025

## Summary

- Embedded the `playbook` CLI into Dynamic Capital's cadence overlay so daily,
  weekly, and quarterly rituals open with the latest initiative briefings rather
  than ad-hoc status checks.
- Expanded the leadership quick-start checklist to require storing rendered
  snapshots with meeting minutes, tightening audit trails for governance
  reviews.

## Cadence Updates

- Daily facilitators now launch `./playbook --section "Summary"` before the
  stand-up to capture fresh highlights and confirm action owners.
- Weekly leadership syncs add desk-specific sections (`Dynamic Trading Algo` and
  `Dynamic Trading Logic`) to their agenda exports to align trading and
  intelligence desks on shared blockers.
- Quarterly governance reviews archive the full rendered document so compliance
  desks can reference prior commitments during audits.

## Follow-Up Actions

1. Distribute the updated cadence overlay excerpt to all ritual owners and
   confirm adoption in the leadership channel.
2. Schedule a retention check next quarter to verify that exported snapshots are
   landing in the governance evidence repository.
3. Extend the CLI guidance to community and investor update rituals once the new
   reporting calendar is finalized.
