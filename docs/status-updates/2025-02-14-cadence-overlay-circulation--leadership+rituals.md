# Cadence Overlay Circulation â€” 14 Feb 2025

## Summary

- Distributed the refreshed cadence overlay excerpt to ritual owners with explicit instructions for attaching CLI exports to leadership channel summaries.
- Reconfirmed responsibilities for daily, weekly, and quarterly facilitators to run the `playbook` CLI and store rendered artefacts alongside meeting minutes.
- Logged circulation evidence and ownership acknowledgements in the governance workspace to maintain auditability.

## Distribution Details

- Sent the cadence overlay excerpt and operating notes to the leadership, trading, and governance ritual owners, requesting acknowledgement within 24 hours.
- Included a standardized snippet for channel summaries clarifying that every `./playbook` export must be attached to the corresponding post.

## Ownership Confirmations

- Daily stand-up facilitators acknowledged receipt and scheduled the CLI export attachment process within their pre-stand-up checklist.
- Weekly leadership sync coordinators agreed to archive CLI outputs in the leadership knowledge base immediately after posting summaries.
- Quarterly governance review leads confirmed that comprehensive CLI exports will be co-located with audit minutes going forward.

## Follow-Up Actions

1. Monitor leadership channel summaries for the next two weeks to ensure CLI attachments are consistently present and flag gaps to ritual owners.
2. Add a verification step to the governance checklist runner so circulation acknowledgements remain traceable for future audits.
3. Capture screenshots or stored exports from the first compliant rituals and archive them under the leadership evidence folder for continuity.
