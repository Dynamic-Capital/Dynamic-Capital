# Hybrid Development Workflow

This guide describes a recommended approach for combining Lovable prototyping with traditional local development and production hosting.

## Overview

```

1. **Maintain production on DigitalOcean** – The live app stays hosted on DigitalOcean with Supabase as its backend. Ensure environment variables are configured in the hosting platform.
2. **Prototype in Lovable** – Use Lovable to design landing pages and UI updates. Configure the same environment variables so prototypes mirror production.
3. **Export via Codex CLI** – Pull changes from Lovable into the repository using the Codex CLI and run `npm run codex:post-pull`
   to install dependencies, sync environment variables, and execute the combined Lovable build.
4. **Local testing and iteration** – Run `node lovable-dev.js` (or `npm run dev:lovable`) to verify environment variables, check Supabase connectivity, and preview the app locally.
5. **GitHub sync and version control** – Commit and push changes to GitHub so both Lovable and DigitalOcean stay in sync.
6. **Deployment pipeline** – Merge validated changes to the production branch. DigitalOcean rebuilds from GitHub, keeping the live app current with Lovable and local updates.

## Notes

- Keep `.env.example` up to date when new variables are introduced.
- Run `npm test` and `npm run lint` before committing to ensure code quality.
- Use `npm run build && npm run build:miniapp` (or `node lovable-build.js`) to compile both the Next.js app and mini app functions.
