# Project Catalog

## Overview

The Dynamic Capital project catalog maps active knowledge bases, code modules,
and operational playbooks into initiative clusters. Use it to orient new
contributors, surface reusable assets, and align workstreams with the platform's
strategic pillars.

## Catalog Matrix

### Foundational Infrastructure

- **Core Runtime (`core/`, `shared/`, `src/`)** – Reusable libraries and service
  primitives that power cross-application capabilities.
- **Platform Configuration (`project.toml`, `deno.json`, `tsconfig.json`)** –
  TypeScript and Deno standards that keep tooling consistent across projects.
- **Environment Scaffolding (`docker/`, `env/`, `server.js`, `Procfile`)** –
  Deployment blueprints and runtime entry points for local and production
  setups.

### Intelligent Systems & Agents

- **Cognitive Engines (`dynamic_thinking/`, `dynamic_creative_thinking/`,
  `dynamic_critical_thinking/`)** – Reasoning toolkits and mental models for
  automated strategy design.
- **Agent Libraries (`dynamic_agents/`, `dynamic_bots/`, `dynamic_trainer/`)** –
  Specialized agent collections, training loops, and orchestration frameworks.
- **Memory Architectures (`dynamic_memory/`,
  `dynamic_memory_reconsolidation/`)** – Long-horizon storage, recall, and
  reinforcement pathways for adaptive systems.

### Market & Treasury Operations

- **Accounting & Wallets (`dynamic_accounting/`, `dynamic_wallet/`,
  `dynamic_forecast/`)** – Finance automation, treasury forecasting, and
  multi-asset reconciliation logic.
- **Market Intelligence (`dynamic_candles/`, `dynamic_numbers/`,
  `dynamic_volume/`, `dynamic_quote/`)** – Data pipelines and analytics models
  for signal generation and pricing.
- **Consensus & Contracts (`dynamic_contracts/`, `dynamic_proof_of_*`,
  `dynamic_stake/`)** – Smart-contract frameworks, consensus experiments, and
  staking mechanics.

### Automation Pipelines

- **Workflow Controllers (`dynamic_task_manager/`, `dynamic_trainer/`,
  `dynamic_tool_kits/`)** – Process automation, iterative training, and
  operations utilities.
- **Messaging Fabrics (`queue/`, `dynamic_message_queue/`, `supabase/`)** –
  Event streaming, job orchestration, and state synchronization components.
- **Scripting Tooling (`scripts/`, `tools/`, `functions/`)** – Command-line and
  serverless utilities for maintenance, deployments, and data preparation.

### Knowledge & Research Assets

- **Documentation Hubs (`docs/`, `_static/`, `content/`)** – Playbooks, white
  papers, inventories, and curated research libraries.
- **Data Foundations (`data/`, `db/`, `dynamic/models/`, `ml/`, `trainer/`)** –
  Datasets, schema definitions, model checkpoints, and experiment harnesses.
- **Research Initiatives (`dynamic.intelligence.ai_apps/`, `dynamic.intelligence.agi/`, `dynamic_quantum/`)** –
  Exploratory programs that extend the platform's intelligence frontier.

### Observability, Security & Governance

- **Risk Controls (`dynamic_firewall/`, `dynamic_encryption/`, `dynamic_kyc/`)**
  – Security operations, compliance protocols, and encryption suites.
- **Audit & Policy (`SECURITY.md`, `CODEOWNERS`,
  `docs/dynamic-capital-security-playbook.md`)** – Governance references,
  operational checklists, and disclosure pathways.
- **Telemetry (`dynamic_logging/`, `dynamic_benchmark/`, `dynamic_validator/`)**
  – Monitoring adapters, validation harnesses, and benchmarking scripts.

### Experience & Interface Layers

- **User Applications (`apps/web`, `apps/landing`, `apps/*`)** – Interface
  surfaces for operators, analysts, and ecosystem members.
- **Design Systems (`docs/ui`, `docs/ui-design-principles.md`, `ui-style.md`)**
  – UX guidelines, component libraries, and prototyping references.
- **Communication Surfaces (`broadcast/`, `bots/`, `dynamic_message_queue/`)** –
  Outreach channels, automation bots, and messaging templates.

### Growth, Partnerships & Ecosystem

- **Business Development (`dynamic_domain_names/`, `dynamic_domain/`,
  `docs/company-profile-dossier.md`)** – Naming inventories, domain logistics,
  and narrative dossiers for partners.
- **Compliance & Legal (`docs/compliance/`, `docs/legal/`, `dynamic_kyc/`)** –
  Regulatory readiness, legal documentation, and jurisdiction playbooks.
- **Partnership Toolkits (`integrations/`, `dynamic_supabase/`,
  `dynamic_proxy/`)** – Third-party connectors, integration guides, and
  collaborative pipelines.

### Frontier Explorations

- **Speculative Research (`dynamic_interstellar_space/`,
  `dynamic_consciousness/`, `dynamic_ultimate_reality/`)** – Experimental
  domains that probe future-state architectures and metaphysical models.
- **Emerging Technologies (`dynamic.platform.web3/`, `dynamic_blockchain/`,
  `dynamic_quantum/`)** – Advanced protocol experiments and cross-chain
  innovations.
- **Creative Sandboxes (`dynamic_creative_thinking/`, `dynamic_expressions/`,
  `dynamic_review/`)** – Narrative engines, communication grammars, and feedback
  loops for brand expression.

## Usage Notes

- Reference this catalog when planning initiatives, onboarding team members, or
  mapping dependencies between workstreams.
- For deeper implementation details, drill into the directory-specific READMEs
  or playbooks listed in the relevant sections.
- Keep the catalog updated as new modules, documents, or services emerge so the
  repository remains navigable for contributors.
