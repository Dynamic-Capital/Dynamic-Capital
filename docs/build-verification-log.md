# Build & Verification Run Log

## Overview

- **Date:** 2024-10-08
- **Operator:** Dynamic AI automation
- **Purpose:** Validate production readiness by running `npm run start`,
  `npm run build`, `npm run output`, `npm run verify`, `npm run export`, and a
  final `npm run output` to confirm artifact generation.

## Command Timeline

| Step | Command          | Result                           | Notes                                                                                                                                    |
| ---- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `npm run start`  | ✅ Success (manually terminated) | Verified production server boots with generated brand assets; terminated via `Ctrl+C` after readiness log.                               |
| 2    | `npm run build`  | ✅ Success                       | Completed Next.js 15 production build for apps/web and apps/landing; emitted standard timezone sync warnings (expected in container).    |
| 3    | `npm run output` | ✅ Success                       | Copied latest static assets into `_static/` from the landing snapshot exporter.                                                          |
| 4    | `npm run verify` | ✅ Success                       | End-to-end verification suite passed, including dynamic module pytest matrix and TON site checks (external gateways intermittently 503). |
| 5    | `npm run export` | ✅ Success                       | Re-ran full build pipeline ensuring export script parity with `npm run build`.                                                           |
| 6    | `npm run output` | ✅ Success                       | Final snapshot refresh confirmed `_static/` contents aligned with latest export.                                                         |

## Observations

- Time synchronization helper scripts emitted warnings because `systemd` and
  `chronyc` are unavailable inside the CI container; build proceeds without
  issue.
- TON gateway reachability checks report intermittent 503 responses for several
  public gateways, but at least one gateway (`https://ton.site`) served content,
  satisfying verification criteria.

## Recommended Next Steps

- No action required—artifacts and verification suite are in a green state.
- If repeated 503 responses from TON gateways become blocking, consider adding
  retries or alternative gateways to reduce noise in verification logs.
