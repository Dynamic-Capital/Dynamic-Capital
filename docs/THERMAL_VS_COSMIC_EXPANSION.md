# Thermal vs. Cosmic Particle Expansion

This note summarizes the key equations governing particle separation in two
distinct physical regimes: thermodynamics and cosmology.

## 1. Thermal Expansion of Particles

When a material absorbs thermal energy, its constituent particles gain kinetic
energy. The increase in vibrational amplitude pushes neighboring particles
farther apart, producing macroscopic expansion.

### Linear Expansion (Solids)

The change in length \(\Delta L\) of a solid rod or bar for a small temperature
change \(\Delta T\) is

\[ \Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T, \]

where:

- \(L_0\) is the original length,
- \(\alpha\) is the coefficient of linear expansion (a material property), and
- \(\Delta T\) is the temperature change.

### Volume Expansion (Solids and Liquids)

The volume change \(\Delta V\) for an object with initial volume \(V_0\) is

\[ \Delta V = \beta V_0 \Delta T, \]

where \(\beta\) is the coefficient of volumetric expansion. For most solids,
\(\beta \approx 3\alpha\).

These relations describe how temperature-driven energy input leads to particle
spacing increases in condensed matter systems.

## 2. Expansion in an Expanding Universe

On cosmological scales, particle separation is governed by the dynamics of
spacetime rather than material properties.

### Hubble's Law

The recession velocity \(v\) between two distant galaxies separated by a
comoving distance \(d\) obeys

\[ v = H_0 d, \]

where \(H_0\) is the Hubble constant characterizing the present-day expansion
rate of the universe.

### Scale Factor Evolution

The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric uses a scale factor
\(a(t)\) to encode cosmic expansion. The physical separation between two
comoving particles evolves as

\[ d(t) = a(t) d_0, \]

with \(d_0\) denoting their initial comoving distance.

## 3. Context-Dependent Expansion Modeling

The governing equation for "particle expansion" must be matched to the physical
context:

- **Thermal systems**: Expansion depends on thermal energy input and temperature
  change, making \(\Delta V = \beta V_0 \Delta T\) (and its linear analog)
  appropriate.
- **Cosmic systems**: Expansion depends on cosmic distances and the evolving
  scale factor, so \(d(t) = a(t) d_0\) or the differential Hubble relation \(v =
  H_0 d\) applies.

A generalized functional description can be written schematically as

\[ E_{\text{expansion}} = f(E_{\text{input}}, T, d, a(t)), \]

indicating that the relevant variables—and therefore the correct governing
equation—change with the physical regime under consideration.
