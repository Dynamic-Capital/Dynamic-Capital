## Phase 0 – Frame the Opportunity
- **Objective.** Confirm the business or research outcome that electromagnetic waves will unlock.
- **Inputs.** Problem statement, beneficiary personas, key constraints (cost, timeline, regulatory).
- **Outputs.**
  - Mission-aligned use case statement (e.g., "Increase early cancer detection throughput by 20% using low-dose X-ray CT").
  - Success metrics tied to measurable system performance (resolution, throughput, uptime, safety incidents).
- **Checklist.**
  - [ ] Stakeholders agree on the user journey and transformation.
  - [ ] Non-negotiables documented (safety thresholds, bandwidth needs, environmental limits).
  - [ ] Optimization thesis drafted (time-to-value, cost reduction, or performance uplift).
  - [ ] Target state visualized via high-level system storyboard.

## Phase 1 – Map Objectives to Spectrum Bands
- **Objective.** Translate requirements into plausible wavelength candidates.
- **Plays.**
  - Use the quick reference matrix to shortlist 1–2 bands per objective.
  - Evaluate signal penetration, energy levels, and available hardware for each candidate.
  - Call out multi-band pairings (e.g., visible imaging + IR thermography) that deliver complementary data.
- **Decision Gate.** Produce a spectrum selection brief summarizing chosen band(s), rationale, and eliminated alternatives.
- **Optimization Levers.**
  - Quantify benefit-versus-cost for each band using a simple weighted scoring model.
  - Run tabletop simulations to confirm workflow fit (coverage, cycle time, staffing).
  - Pre-stage vendor technical evaluations to accelerate procurement once a band is locked.
- **Signals & Metrics.** At least one validated supplier or instrument exists per shortlisted band; regulatory pathway identified for top choice.

## Phase 2 – Prototype & Validate
- **Objective.** Build confidence that the selected band can deliver the required performance safely.
- **Plays.**
  - Design small experiments capturing baseline signal-to-noise, exposure duration, or data rate.
  - Stress-test materials and sensors against expected operating conditions (temperature, humidity, vibration).
  - Establish calibration routines (phantoms for imaging, known thermal targets for IR, frequency sweeps for RF).
- **Optimization Levers.**
  - Automate data capture so each experiment feeds a shared analytics workspace.
  - Pre-compute maintainability metrics (mean time to repair, consumable burn rate).
  - Pilot closed-loop controls where feasible to reduce operator burden.
- **Deliverables.** Prototype report with pass/fail against success metrics, updated risk log, and bill of materials draft.
- **Metrics.** Prototype achieves ≥80% of target metric; safety measures validated through peer review.

## Phase 3 – Integrate into the Program Roadmap
- **Objective.** Embed the spectrum solution inside the broader product, operations, or research workflow.
- **Plays.**
  - Align manufacturing and maintenance processes with the chosen band (lamp replacement cycles, detector recalibration cadence, antenna retuning intervals).
  - Update onboarding manuals so operators understand exposure limits, PPE, and emergency procedures.
  - Plan data infrastructure: storage formats, telemetry frequency, analytics dashboards.
- **Decision Gate.** Cross-functional review (engineering, safety, compliance, operations) signs off on the integration plan.
- **Optimization Levers.**
  - Create a sprint backlog that sequences hardware readiness, data ingestion, and training deliverables.
  - Embed continuous improvement KPIs (throughput, downtime, accuracy) into program dashboards.
  - Negotiate service level agreements with vendors to secure spare parts and escalation paths.
- **Metrics.** Deployment schedule synchronized with dependent teams; cost of ownership modeled over 12–24 months.

## Phase 4 – Operate, Monitor, and Iterate
- **Objective.** Ensure sustained performance while adapting to real-world feedback.
- **Plays.**
  - Instrument continuous monitoring (dose meters, temperature sensors, signal quality KPIs).
  - Schedule periodic audits of shielding, firmware, and calibration records.
  - Capture lessons learned in a living knowledge base; revisit alternative bands if KPIs stagnate.
- **Optimization Levers.**
  - Compare operational telemetry against design baselines weekly to surface drift early.
  - Launch operator feedback loops (surveys, retrospectives) to prioritize incremental upgrades.
  - Pre-plan capacity expansions (additional scanners, antennas, sensors) with trigger thresholds.
- **Metrics.**
  - Safety incidents remain at zero; audits close action items within SLA.
  - Performance metrics trend toward or exceed success thresholds.
  - New use cases or optimizations logged quarterly.

### Backlog of Core Plays

1. **Establish the Spectrum Optimization Canvas.** Capture target metrics, enabling technologies, constraints, and regulatory considerations on a single page. Revisit after each phase gate.
2. **Stand up the Experiment Factory.** Instrument prototypes with automated logging, create templated notebooks, and enable rapid what-if simulations to accelerate learning cycles.
3. **Build the Integration Runway.** Reserve installation windows, secure change-management approvals, and stage training content in the LMS before hardware arrives.
4. **Operationalize Feedback Loops.** Configure telemetry dashboards, incident intake routes, and quarterly business reviews that convert observations into backlog items.
5. **Institutionalize Knowledge.** Version-control SOPs, calibration procedures, and vendor certifications so teams onboarding later inherit the optimized practices.

## Operational Checkpoints
- Mission review confirms the solution still advances the desired transformation each quarter.
- Hypothesis tracker updated whenever the team shifts bands or modifies exposure parameters.
- Incident response drills rehearse spectrum-specific emergencies (e.g., UV overexposure, RF interference).
- Procurement maintains at least two qualified vendors for critical emitters, detectors, or shielding materials.

Use this playbook as a living document—update phase deliverables, risks, and guardrails as new electromagnetic insights or regulatory changes emerge.

## Dynamic Wave Catalog Automation

Leverage the `dynamic_wave` module to ensure every deployment plan starts with a complete, named inventory of spectrum bands. The catalog seeds all core bands, generates deterministic dynamic names for project tracking, and exposes a serialisable summary for dashboards or program logs.

```python
from dynamic_wave import DynamicWaveCatalog

catalog = DynamicWaveCatalog()
catalog.optimise(project="spectrum-initiative")
for wave in catalog.summary():
    print(wave["band"], wave["dynamic_name"])
```

| Band | Example Dynamic Name (`project="spectrum-initiative"`) |
| --- | --- |
| Gamma | Gamma-Ara-se-9818990b-spectrum-initiat |
| X-Ray | X-Ray-Flux-wa-b70b9cdc-spectrum-initiat |
| Ultraviolet | Ultraviolet-Vela-ca-da9ed830-spectrum-initiat |
| Visible | Visible-Quanta-ki-5f88df51-spectrum-initiat |
| Infrared | Infrared-Spire-ra-7974d4d8-spectrum-initiat |
| Microwave | Microwave-Vela-pa-3f9843cc-spectrum-initiat |
| Radio | Radio-Nova-to-a24cb462-spectrum-initiat |

Use the generated names to tag experiments, procurement tracks, or telemetry feeds so stakeholders can trace decisions back to their originating band without ambiguity.
