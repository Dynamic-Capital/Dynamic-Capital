```

## Outcome

- The HTTP request completed, but Microsoft returned an HTML error message stating that the request was blocked by their edge network.
- The response body confirmed the block with reference identifiers (e.g., "Ref A: 685DCCB2EA1C48A7BB36B19785E02C81").

## Next Steps

- Access the link through a standard web browser session that can complete the OneDrive security checks.
- If automation is still required, generate a direct download link from within the OneDrive UI or provide temporary API credentials that permit authenticated access.
