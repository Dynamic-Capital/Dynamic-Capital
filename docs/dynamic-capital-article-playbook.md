| Design | Shape the narrative and reader promise | Who are we serving? What transformation will they experience? | Audience snapshot, thesis + outline |
| Draft | Produce the manuscript | What evidence, stories, and visuals best deliver the promise? | Annotated draft with citations |
| Polish | Stress-test clarity, accuracy, and compliance | Is the piece truthful, compassionate, and regulation-safe? | Editing checklist, compliance log |
| Ship | Publish and distribute | Where will it live and how will we amplify it? | Publication plan, social + email copy |
| Learn | Capture feedback to improve the next piece | What worked, what underperformed, and what to test next? | Post-launch retro, KPI summary |

## 1. Align

**Objective.** Anchor the article to current strategic priorities and ensure it advances mission outcomes.

**Steps.**
1. Draft a one-page creative brief covering goal (educate, persuade, announce, reflect), primary mission pillar, and desired reader action.
2. Note regulatory considerations or compliance gates, especially for investment, zakat, or shariah-sensitive topics.
3. Secure alignment from the content lead and relevant subject-matter expert (SME) before outlining.

**Success Signals.**
- Creative brief approved within two business days.
- Mission linkage cited explicitly in the brief and restated in the opening paragraph.

## 2. Design

**Objective.** Translate strategy into a compelling narrative blueprint.

**Steps.**
1. Build a reader snapshot describing the persona, their current tension, and the promised transformation.
2. Draft a thesis statement and three supporting arguments tied to data, scholarship, or lived experience.
3. Outline the article using the arc **Context → Tension → Resolution → Call to Action** and identify where visuals or sidebars will appear.

**Success Signals.**
- Outline reviewed by SME for accuracy and nuance.
- Planned visuals reinforce understanding rather than decorate.

## 3. Draft

**Objective.** Produce a manuscript that is authoritative, compassionate, and on-brand.

**Steps.**
1. Lead with a hook grounded in real stakes (story, data point, or provocative question).
2. Use confident humility in tone—direct sentences, minimal jargon, and respectful integration of faith references.
3. Annotate evidence inline: cite Qur'anic verses, Hadith, scholarship, and market data with translations or links.
4. Embed callouts (pull quotes, checklists, infographics) where they clarify complex ideas.

**Success Signals.**
- Draft includes complete citations and alt text placeholders for each visual.
- Paragraphs average ≤120 words for readability; subheadings appear every 250-300 words.

## 4. Polish

**Objective.** Guarantee the article is accurate, compliant, and reader-ready.

**Steps.**
1. Run a layered edit: structural, line, and copy. Confirm flow, remove repetition, and tighten language.
2. Execute the editing checklist: grammar, inclusive language, formatting, source verification, and tone alignment.
3. Route to compliance when financial advice, regulatory interpretation, or client data is present. Capture sign-off in the compliance log.
4. Finalize visuals with accessible descriptions and confirm media rights.

**Success Signals.**
- Zero unresolved comments before handing to publishing.
- Compliance sign-off timestamped and stored with the final draft.

## 5. Ship

**Objective.** Publish seamlessly and amplify through owned channels.

**Steps.**
1. Schedule publication against the editorial calendar to avoid conflicts with launches or campaigns.
2. Prepare companion assets: newsletter blurbs, social threads, discussion prompts, and internal enablement notes.
3. Ensure CMS metadata is complete—SEO title ≤60 characters, meta description ≤155 characters, canonical URL, and tagging aligned to taxonomy.
4. Publish, then validate formatting on desktop and mobile within 30 minutes.

**Success Signals.**
- Publishing checklist completed without regression issues.
- Companion assets delivered to channel owners at least 24 hours pre-launch.

## 6. Learn

**Objective.** Capture insights so each article improves the next.

**Steps.**
1. Monitor engagement (CTR, read time, conversions, replies) for at least seven days post-launch.
2. Collect qualitative feedback from comments, DMs, and partner conversations; categorize as insight, question, or request.
3. Hold a 20-minute retro with the content lead and SME to identify what to **Continue**, **Adjust**, and **Retire**.
4. Update the article playbook backlog with experiments to run (e.g., new hook formats, interactive elements, translation opportunities).

**Success Signals.**
- Retro notes logged in the knowledge base within three business days.
- At least one new experiment or refinement added to the backlog per article.
