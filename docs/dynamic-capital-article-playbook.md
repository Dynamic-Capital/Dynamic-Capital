## 1. Align

**Objective.** Anchor the article to current strategic priorities and ensure it
advances mission outcomes.

**Steps.**

1. Draft a one-page creative brief covering goal (educate, persuade, announce,
   reflect), primary mission pillar, and desired reader action.
2. Note regulatory considerations or compliance gates, especially for
   investment, zakat, or shariah-sensitive topics.
3. Secure alignment from the content lead and relevant subject-matter expert
   (SME) before outlining.

**Success Signals.**

- Creative brief approved within two business days.
- Mission linkage cited explicitly in the brief and restated in the opening
  paragraph.

## 2. Design

**Objective.** Translate strategy into a compelling narrative blueprint.

**Steps.**

1. Build a reader snapshot describing the persona, their current tension, and
   the promised transformation.
2. Draft a thesis statement and three supporting arguments tied to data,
   scholarship, or lived experience.
3. Outline the article using the arc **Context → Tension → Resolution → Call to
   Action** and identify where visuals or sidebars will appear.

**Success Signals.**

- Outline reviewed by SME for accuracy and nuance.
- Planned visuals reinforce understanding rather than decorate.

## 3. Draft

**Objective.** Produce a manuscript that is authoritative, compassionate, and
on-brand.

**Steps.**

1. Lead with a hook grounded in real stakes (story, data point, or provocative
   question).
2. Use confident humility in tone—direct sentences, minimal jargon, and
   respectful integration of faith references.
3. Annotate evidence inline: cite Qur'anic verses, Hadith, scholarship, and
   market data with translations or links.
4. Embed callouts (pull quotes, checklists, infographics) where they clarify
   complex ideas.

**Success Signals.**

- Draft includes complete citations and alt text placeholders for each visual.
- Paragraphs average ≤120 words for readability; subheadings appear every
  250-300 words.

## 4. Polish

**Objective.** Guarantee the article is accurate, compliant, and reader-ready.

**Steps.**

1. Run a layered edit: structural, line, and copy. Confirm flow, remove
   repetition, and tighten language.
2. Execute the editing checklist: grammar, inclusive language, formatting,
   source verification, and tone alignment.
3. Route to compliance when financial advice, regulatory interpretation, or
   client data is present. Capture sign-off in the compliance log.
4. Finalize visuals with accessible descriptions and confirm media rights.

**Success Signals.**

- Zero unresolved comments before handing to publishing.
- Compliance sign-off timestamped and stored with the final draft.

## 5. Ship

**Objective.** Publish seamlessly and amplify through owned channels.

**Steps.**

1. Schedule publication against the editorial calendar to avoid conflicts with
   launches or campaigns.
2. Prepare companion assets: newsletter blurbs, social threads, discussion
   prompts, and internal enablement notes.
3. Ensure CMS metadata is complete—SEO title ≤60 characters, meta description
   ≤155 characters, canonical URL, and tagging aligned to taxonomy.
4. Publish, then validate formatting on desktop and mobile within 30 minutes.

**Success Signals.**

- Publishing checklist completed without regression issues.
- Companion assets delivered to channel owners at least 24 hours pre-launch.

## 6. Learn

**Objective.** Capture insights so each article improves the next.

**Steps.**

1. Monitor engagement (CTR, read time, conversions, replies) for at least seven
   days post-launch.
2. Collect qualitative feedback from comments, DMs, and partner conversations;
   categorize as insight, question, or request.
3. Hold a 20-minute retro with the content lead and SME to identify what to
   **Continue**, **Adjust**, and **Retire**.
4. Update the article playbook backlog with experiments to run (e.g., new hook
   formats, interactive elements, translation opportunities).

**Success Signals.**

- Retro notes logged in the knowledge base within three business days.
- At least one new experiment or refinement added to the backlog per article.

## Governance & Roles

- **Content Lead:** Owns creative brief approval, editorial calendar, and final
  publish decision.
- **Subject-Matter Expert:** Provides theological, financial, or technical
  accuracy checks.
- **Compliance Reviewer:** Validates regulatory alignment, especially for
  investment or donation guidance.
- **Design Partner:** Produces visuals, ensures accessibility, and maintains
  brand consistency.
- **Analytics Partner:** Tracks post-launch metrics and feeds insights into
  retros.

## Tooling & Templates

  content to strategic priorities.
