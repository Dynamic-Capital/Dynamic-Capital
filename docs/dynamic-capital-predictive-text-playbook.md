# Dynamic Capital Predictive Text Playbook

## 1. Objective

Deliver high-quality predictive text experiences that accelerate user
productivity while preserving tone, privacy, and trust. The optimized system
should:

- reduce keystrokes by **≥25%** without degrading accuracy;
- adapt to user style and domain jargon in near-real time;
- enforce enterprise-grade privacy, compliance, and observability.

## 2. Mathematical Foundation

Given a sequence of tokens \(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n\), estimate

\[ P(w_{n+1} \mid w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n). \]

### 2.1 N-gram Approximation

Use a Markov assumption of order \(k\):

\[ P(w_{n+1} \mid w_{n-k+1}, \ldots, w_n). \]

Apply smoothing (Kneser–Ney, Good–Turing) to mitigate sparsity and back-off when
context is unseen.

### 2.2 Neural Language Modeling

Autoregressive neural architectures—GRUs, LSTMs, and transformers—encode the
entire context before applying a softmax layer over the vocabulary. Techniques
for optimization include teacher forcing, label smoothing, and mixed-precision
training.

### 2.3 Hybrid & Personalization Priors

Combine global neural logits with user-specific priors \(P_u\) derived from the
user’s history:

\[ P^*(w_{n+1}) = \lambda P_{\text{global}}(w_{n+1}) + (1 - \lambda)
P_u(w_{n+1}). \]

Tune \(\lambda\) per cohort to balance personalization with privacy.

## 3. Architecture Blueprint

```
Input stream → Text normalization → Context encoder → Candidate generator →
Ranking layer → Suggestion API → Client UX → Feedback logger → Feature store
                               ↘─────────────── Online metrics ─────────────↗
```

Key components:

- **Normalization:** Handle casing, punctuation, emojis, and multilingual text.
- **Candidate generator:** Blend lexical, neural, and template-based proposals.
- **Ranking:** Score with contextual probability, diversity penalties, and
  business rules (e.g., banned phrases).
- **Feedback loop:** Capture accept/reject signals for continual learning.

## 4. Modeling Approaches

### 4.1 Statistical Baselines

- Fast to compute, ideal for cold-start or on-device scenarios.
- Employ back-off n-grams with pruning to fit memory constraints.
- Use caching for recent contexts to reduce latency.

### 4.2 Neural Language Models

- Fine-tune transformer decoders (e.g., GPT-style) on domain corpora.
- Apply parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA, adapters) for rapid iteration.
- Distill large teacher models into edge-friendly students.

### 4.3 Retrieval-Augmented Suggestions

- Index organizational knowledge bases and recent documents.
- Retrieve relevant snippets to inform completions with grounded context.

### 4.4 Personalization Layer

- Maintain user embeddings derived from accepted suggestions and authored
  content.
- Enforce privacy by training on-device or with differential privacy noise.
- Provide opt-out controls and transparency in user settings.

## 5. Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering

1. **Ingestion:** Stream anonymized keystroke events and historical documents.
2. **Filtering:** Remove sensitive data via named-entity recognition and policy
   rules.
3. **Normalization:** Tokenize, lowercase (where appropriate), and annotate with
   linguistic tags.
4. **Feature store:** Persist context windows, acceptance rates, and user
   metadata (role, device) for online serving.
5. **Labeling:** Align accepted suggestions as positive targets; rejected or
   ignored suggestions inform negative sampling.

## 6. Training & Optimization Playbook

| Phase                | Actions                                                                | Outputs                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Exploration**      | Evaluate n-gram and transformer baselines; run ablation studies.       | Model leaderboard, latency budget. |
| **Fine-tuning**      | Apply curriculum learning (general → domain → user cohorts).           | Domain-specialized checkpoints.    |
| **Compression**      | Quantize, prune, or distill for edge deployments.                      | Lightweight inference artifacts.   |
| **Evaluation**       | Measure perplexity, keystroke savings, latency, and diversity indices. | Release readiness report.          |
| **Launch & Iterate** | Roll out via feature flags; monitor metrics and collect user feedback. | Incremental improvement roadmap.   |

Optimization levers:

- **Latency:** Use batching, speculative decoding, and early exit thresholds.
- **Quality:** Calibrate temperature, nucleus sampling, or top-k limits to
  balance creativity vs. precision.
- **Diversity:** Penalize duplicate stems, enforce part-of-speech variety, and
  explore reinforcement learning with acceptance rewards.

## 7. Evaluation & Monitoring

| Metric                    | Target                     | Notes                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Keystroke savings         | ≥25%                       | Primary productivity indicator.                    |
| Suggestion acceptance     | ≥35%                       | Track by cohort/device for personalization tuning. |
| Perplexity (validation)   | ↓ vs. baseline             | Signals modeling improvements.                     |
| Latency (P95)             | ≤80 ms (edge), ≤150 ms API | Keep UX fluid; fall back to cached n-grams.        |
| Toxicity / policy strikes | 0                          | Enforce filters and human-in-the-loop review.      |

Monitoring checklist:

- Real-time dashboards for latency, error rates, and acceptance.
- Drift detection on vocabulary and intent distributions.
- Canary releases with automatic rollback triggers.

## 8. Product Experience Guidelines

- Show **top 3** ranked suggestions; use inline ghost text for highest score.
- Provide quick actions for dismissing or cycling suggestions (e.g., Tab, ↩︎).
- Explain personalization signals and offer granular opt-in choices.
- Collect implicit feedback (accept/reject) and explicit thumbs-up/down prompts
  on new features.

## 9. Privacy, Security & Compliance

- Encrypt data in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256 or better).
- Apply data minimization—drop raw keystrokes after feature extraction.
- Support regional data residency and GDPR/CCPA compliance pathways.
- Conduct red-team prompts for prompt-injection and data exfiltration risks.

## 10. Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Define success metrics and baseline measurements.
- [ ] Instrument client apps for keystroke savings and latency tracking.
