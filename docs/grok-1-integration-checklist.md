# Grok-1 Integration Checklist

Use this checklist to operationalize Grok-1 inside the Dynamic Capital
automation stack—from research workflows to Telegram delivery—without breaking
existing guardrails.

> **Status:** Planned. Complete each section before inviting broader team usage
> or shipping Grok-powered outputs to members.

## 1. Repository & Access Preparation

- [ ] Fork or mirror [`xai-org/grok-1`](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-1) into
a vetted organization account and review the license obligations.
- [ ] Capture model weights, tokenizer assets, and required build tooling in a
controlled artifact store (e.g., private bucket + checksum manifest).
- [ ] Align environment variable naming with `docs/env.md`; document any new
secrets in `.env.example` and Supabase/Vercel vaults without committing real
values.
- [ ] Update `docs/REPO_INVENTORY.md` (or equivalent) with the local cache
location, synchronization cadence, and retention policy for Grok assets.

## 2. Prompting & Context Design

- [ ] Establish canonical prompt templates for SMC ideation, execution guardrail
reviews, and UI copywriting; store them under `content/prompts/grok-1/`.
- [ ] Map repository artifacts (TradeConfig logs, analyzer traces, glossary
entries) to prompt attachments so responses stay grounded in current logic.
- [ ] Define token budgets, truncation rules, and paraphrase safeguards before
exposing prompts to automated jobs.
- [ ] Record evaluation prompts and expected outputs in `tests/llm-scenarios/`
for regression testing.

## 3. Trading Strategy & Analyzer Enhancements

- [ ] Integrate Grok-assisted idea reviews into the `algorithms/` workflow
(e.g., PR template checkbox, reviewer step, or IDE helper notes).
- [ ] Codify how Grok suggestions translate into Pine Script or TypeScript
changes; update `algorithms/README.md` with the acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Gate analyzer modifications on new or updated tests in
`tests/trading-*`—include Grok-generated heuristics in test fixtures for
repeatability.
- [ ] Document a rollback plan when Grok-generated logic underperforms (feature
flag, config revert, or analyzer toggle).

## 4. Signal Ingestion & Supabase Coordination

- [ ] Extend webhook payload schemas (`api/tradingview-alerts.ts`, Supabase
migrations) to capture any new fields Grok recommends.
- [ ] Run Supabase migrations in staging and update RLS policies if Grok outputs
introduce new roles or columns.
- [ ] Add logging that distinguishes Grok-suggested alerts versus human-crafted
payloads to support downstream analytics.
- [ ] Update `supabase/functions/*` docs so operators know which flows depend on
Grok output and where to validate signals.

## 5. Execution Layer & Risk Controls

- [ ] Have Grok produce risk scenario scripts and validate them against existing
Expert Advisor safeguards (`Experts/`, `Include/`).
- [ ] Stress-test queue workers and Supabase polling with Grok-generated edge
cases; capture failures in the runbook for remediation.
- [ ] Ensure overrides or manual approvals log whether Grok participated in the
decision so accountability is clear.
- [ ] Confirm Task Scheduler / service restarts still recover cleanly with the
new load profile.

## 6. Telegram & Mini App Experiences

- [ ] Prototype Grok-assisted copy in a staging branch of
`apps/web/app/telegram/` while keeping Tailwind conventions intact.
- [ ] Verify Mini App theming remains synced when Grok introduces new content
modules or cards.
- [ ] Add UX acceptance criteria for Grok responses (tone, length, disclaimers)
to the UI QA checklist.
- [ ] Update broadcast templates and admin tooling to highlight when content was
assisted by Grok.

## 7. Operations, Compliance & Monitoring

- [ ] Expand monitoring dashboards (Supabase logs, Redis metrics, MT5 bridge
health) with Grok-specific dimensions and alerts.
- [ ] Capture evaluation metrics (win rate impact, reviewer acceptance) in a
shared dashboard or Notion page.
- [ ] Coordinate a security review covering prompt injection, data leakage, and
secret handling before production rollout.
- [ ] Train operators using refreshed runbooks and record dry-run transcripts in
`docs/meeting-notes/`.

Maintain this checklist as Grok-1 capabilities evolve so future upgrades follow
the same guardrails.
