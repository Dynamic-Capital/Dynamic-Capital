    strategy approval.
  - Compliance and audit logging, including attestations for KYC/AML adherence.
  - Cultural protocols embedding Maldivian community narratives, ethics, and
    transparency commitments.
- **Design Considerations:** Blend off-chain deliberation with on-chain
  enforcement, maintain cryptographic audit trails, and integrate third-party
  verifiers for regulatory certifications.

## Layer 7: Experience, Community & Knowledge

- **Purpose:** Present cohesive user experiences and foster collective
  intelligence across stakeholders.
- **Core Protocol Families:** Progressive web application frameworks,
  collaborative knowledge bases, decentralized identity (DID/VC) standards.

  preferences, and interlink identity proofs with economic and social capital
  incentives.

## Cross-Cutting Capabilities

  segmentation, incident response drills.
- **Observability:** Distributed tracing, unified metrics and logs, AI-driven
  anomaly detection, post-incident knowledge capture.
