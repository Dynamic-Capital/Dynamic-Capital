# Dynamic Atom Ops Playbook

Dynamic A.T.O.M.S. (Artificial Technologies Optimizing Minds & Systems) operate
as the modular intelligence fabric within the Dynamic universe. The following
playbook captures the population metrics, operational pillars, and iterative
cadences required to keep the 118 tracked atom types aligned with DCT
orchestration.

## Population Signals

- **Catalogued types:** 118 Dynamic atom types remain under continuous
  observation.
- **Total population:** ~$10^{80}$ Dynamic atoms power the broader universe,
  with long-tail discoveries expected across new environments.
- **DCT connectivity:** ~$10^{27}$ Dynamic atoms maintain live DCT links,
  forming the high-fidelity backbone for capital routing and telemetry.

Use these anchors whenever you recalibrate resource allocations, simulate load
scenarios, or renegotiate cross-team commitments.

## Operational Pillars

1. **Stability Safeguards** — Sustain baseline integrity by validating shell
   conservation, ledger proofs, and governance constraints before promoting new
   models or execution pathways.
2. **Signal Breathing** — Preserve market context by rotating data freshness
   sweeps, quota audits, and redundancy drills to prevent telemetry
   asphyxiation.
3. **Ignition Bursts** — Align execution surges with conviction thresholds;
   load-test order routers and throttle logic prior to enabling high-frequency
   strategies.
4. **Interface Weaving** — Translate between automated decisions and operator
   intent with routine UX telemetry reviews and annotation syncs after every
   release.
5. **Frontier Prototyping** — Sandbox speculative atoms, gating their activation
   behind feature flags, synthetic liquidity, and mirrored observability until
   they graduate into production tiers.

Each pillar maps directly to the families outlined in the generated catalogues
and should be reflected in quarterly OKRs and incident response playbooks.

## DCT Integration Cadence

- **Connectivity sweeps:** Reconcile DCT connection counts against expected
  ~10^{27} baseline weekly; investigate drift exceeding 0.5%.
- **Ops reviews:** Conduct cross-family retrospectives bi-weekly, focusing on
  failover drill results, telemetry coverage, and knowledge graph freshness.
- **Mass recalibration:** Re-run the generator script prior to major roadmap
  gates or when onboarding new data streams to ensure atomic masses and shell
  structures remain synchronized.

## Refresh Procedure

Run the catalogue generator before distributing updates or attaching this
playbook to planning briefs:

```bash
$(bash scripts/deno_bin.sh) run -A scripts/docs/create-atoms-and-elements.ts
```

The resulting `dynamic-atoms-catalog.md` and `dynamic-elements-catalog.md`
outputs should be cross-referenced with the pillars above to confirm operational
coverage.
