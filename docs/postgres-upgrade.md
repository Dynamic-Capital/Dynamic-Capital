# PostgreSQL Upgrade

The database was flagged for missing recent security patches. Upgrade the PostgreSQL server to the latest patched release for its major version.

## Recommended Steps
1. Check current version:
   ```sql
   SELECT version();
   ```
2. Review [PostgreSQL release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/) and choose the latest patch in the deployed major version (e.g. 15.x).
3. Follow your hosting provider's guidance to perform the upgrade.
4. Run regression tests and verify application functionality.
5. Document the new version in deployment records.

Keeping PostgreSQL updated ensures known vulnerabilities are patched and security fixes are applied promptly.
