# Dynamic Capital Security Playbook

## Purpose & Scope
This playbook codifies Dynamic Capital's endpoint and user protection strategy. It is designed for security engineering, IT operations, and procurement teams that deploy, monitor, and continually tune the control stack safeguarding trading and research environments.

## Playbook at a Glance
| Objective | Primary Owner | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maintain full endpoint coverage across supported platforms | Security Engineering | Continuous monitoring |
| Validate control efficacy against emerging threats | Threat Operations | Quarterly purple-team and tabletop testing |
| Optimize performance impact on trading workstations | IT Operations | Monthly capacity reviews |

## Core Protection Layers
| Feature | Why it Matters | Operational Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real-time protection / on-access scanning | Blocks malicious activity the moment it executes. | Favor engines with low false positives and tunable exclusion lists for trading software. |
| Behavioral / heuristic / anomaly detection | Detects zero-day threats through suspicious behavior patterns. | Maintain allowlists for sanctioned automation; review heuristic alerts daily. |
| Exploit / vulnerability protection | Stops attacks that weaponize unpatched software flaws. | Pair with patch SLAs; validate coverage on browsers, productivity suites, and trading tools. |
| Firewall / network attack blocking | Prevents command-and-control traffic and lateral movement. | Enforce zero-trust egress policies and auto-quarantine on policy violations. |
| Ransomware / tamper protection | Guards critical data paths from unauthorized encryption or modification. | Test rollback and isolation workflows quarterly; secure policies with admin-only tamper controls. |
| Anti-phishing / web protection | Defends against credential theft and drive-by downloads. | Integrate with secure email/web gateways and user awareness campaigns. |
| Smart updates / cloud-assisted intelligence | Delivers near-real-time protection signatures and heuristics. | Stagger updates to avoid market-hours disruption; monitor update compliance daily. |
| Cross-platform / mobile support | Ensures consistent coverage across Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices. | Reconcile asset inventory quarterly; automate enrollment for new devices. |
| Value-add capabilities (VPN, password vault, DLP, etc.) | Extends protection and compliance coverage. | Enable only modules that align with policy; document any compensating controls. |
| Low system impact / resource governance | Preserves workstation performance for latency-sensitive workflows. | Benchmark CPU/RAM impact before rollout; track variances in monthly reviews. |

## Implementation Blueprint
1. **Requirements Definition (Week 0–1):** Document regulatory, latency, and resilience requirements. Map features in the table above to mandatory, preferred, and optional categories.
2. **Vendor Evaluation (Week 1–3):** Score candidate platforms against requirements, integrating results from third-party evaluations and red-team simulations.
3. **Pilot & Baseline (Week 3–5):** Deploy to 10% of representative endpoints. Collect baseline telemetry (CPU, memory, network usage, alert fidelity) and validate SIEM ingestion.
4. **Policy Hardening (Week 5–6):** Customize profiles for trading, research, and back-office personas. Apply tamper protection and role-based admin separation.
5. **Phased Rollout (Week 6–8):** Expand coverage in weekly cohorts with rollback checkpoints. Automate enrollment through MDM and configuration management.
6. **Automation & Integration (Week 8+):** Enable API-driven containment and remediation. Feed detections into SOAR playbooks and ensure ticketing integration for exception handling.

## Operational Runbook
### Daily
- Review high-severity alerts and behavioral detections; confirm automatic containment executed as designed.
- Verify last update timestamp for all endpoints via the management console; remediate gaps within 4 hours.

### Weekly
- Inspect medium-severity and network-layer alerts, tuning policies to reduce noise without sacrificing coverage.
- Audit newly onboarded devices for correct policy assignment and SIEM telemetry.

### Monthly
- Present metrics to security leadership, highlighting control efficacy, false-positive trends, and performance impact.
- Refresh threat intelligence feeds and confirm update channels are synchronized with vendor advisories.

### Quarterly
- Conduct tabletop and purple-team exercises focused on phishing, ransomware, and exploit vectors.
- Validate backup restoration and ransomware rollback capabilities end-to-end.

## Incident Response Workflow
1. **Detection & Triage:** Confirm detection fidelity, gather endpoint telemetry, and determine blast radius.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected assets via EDR network controls or MDM quarantine. Coordinate with network team for macro-level blocking.
3. **Eradication & Recovery:** Execute vendor playbooks for malware removal, restore from known-good backups, and verify endpoint health checks.
4. **Post-Incident Review:** Within 48 hours, document root cause, control gaps, and remediation owners. Update policies or automations accordingly.

## Metrics & Continuous Improvement
- **Coverage:** Percentage of managed endpoints reporting healthy status within the last 24 hours (target ≥ 98%).
- **Response:** Mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) for endpoint incidents (targets ≤ 15 minutes and ≤ 2 hours, respectively).
- **Prevention:** Count of blocked phishing, ransomware, and exploit attempts per quarter, correlated with upstream email/web defenses.
- **Performance:** Average CPU/RAM impact across trading and research workstations, with thresholds defined in latency SLAs.
- **Program Health:** Number of outstanding policy exceptions older than 30 days.

## Review & Governance
- **Cadence:** Reassess this playbook every six months or following major tooling changes.
- **Stakeholders:** Include representatives from Security Engineering, IT Operations, Threat Operations, and Compliance.
- **Documentation:** Store approvals and revisions in the GRC platform; link to audit evidence for vendor assessments and tabletop outcomes.
