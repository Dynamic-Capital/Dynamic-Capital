# Strategic Operations Integration Plan

This plan expands on the recommended focus areas for improving Dynamic Capital's
playbooks and dynamic algorithms. Each section translates the high-level
guidance into concrete deliverables, owners, cadences, and success measures.

## 1. Layer Strategic Analysis into the Playbook Lifecycle

## Execution Roadmap

1. **Week 0–2**: Stand up working groups for each focus area, confirm owners,
   and finalize updated templates (playbook governance, algorithm intake, HR
   mapping).
2. **Week 3–6**: Pilot the expanded processes with two flagship initiatives;
   capture baseline metrics and feedback.
3. **Week 7–10**: Roll out Supabase schema updates, automation client
   integrations, and telemetry enhancements.
4. **Week 11–12**: Run cross-functional retrospectives, adjust runbooks, and
   publish the first quarterly enablement and quality reports.
5. **Ongoing**: Monitor dashboards, enforce cadences, and iterate based on KPI
   trends and stakeholder feedback.

## Governance and Reporting

- **Monthly Steering Review**: Consolidated report highlighting KPI performance,
  outstanding risks, and decisions needed.
- **Quarterly Strategy Sync**: Deep-dive on environmental analysis, HR
  enablement outcomes, and algorithm efficacy.
- **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Collect qualitative insights from squads, HR,
  and operations teams to refine playbooks and automations.

## Tooling Enhancements

- Integrate Supabase triggers with Slack/Teams for freshness alerts.
- Leverage Airflow DAG annotations to document strategic context alongside task
  definitions.
- Extend the shared dashboard to visualize algorithm release cadence, HR
  readiness, and quality metrics in one view.

## Risk Mitigation

- Maintain a change backlog with dependency mapping to prevent conflicting
  updates.
- Enforce rollback plans and feature flags for algorithm releases.
- Schedule quarterly security reviews to validate secrets hygiene and incident
  preparedness.

## Success Criteria

The recommendations are considered complete when:

1. Every active playbook and dynamic algorithm has up-to-date strategic context
   recorded in Supabase.
2. Algorithm releases consistently meet intake, testing, and retrospective
   requirements without exceptions.
3. HR enablement artifacts demonstrate alignment between talent pipelines and
   algorithm needs.
4. Automation consumers operate on synchronized role focus snapshots with
   near-real-time drift detection.
5. Observability and incident-response metrics meet the thresholds defined above
   for two consecutive quarters.
