# TradingView ↔ MT5 ↔ Next.js Integration Guide

This guide outlines practical patterns for connecting TradingView alerts to automated MetaTrader 5 (MT5) execution while surfacing controls and telemetry through a Next.js dashboard. It complements the existing TradingView onboarding and bridge checklists by mapping the integration decisions to concrete implementation tracks.

## 1. Architecture Overview

The integration spans three domains:

1. **Signal Generation (TradingView)** – Pine Script strategies or indicators that emit structured alerts.
2. **Execution Layer (MT5)** – An Expert Advisor (EA) or Python bridge that converts alerts into broker orders.
3. **Control Plane (Next.js)** – A web application used for configuration, monitoring, and reporting.

Because TradingView and MT5 cannot communicate directly, every solution introduces an intermediary bridge. Choose one of the following patterns based on resourcing and latency goals.

### 1.1 Cloud bridge services

- **Flow**: TradingView webhook → hosted bridge (e.g., WebhookTrade) → MT4/MT5 trade.
- **Strengths**: Minimal DevOps footprint, rapid setup, vendor-managed reliability.
- **Trade-offs**: Limited customization, dependency on third-party pricing and uptime, vendor-specific credentials.
- **Recommended use**: When you need automation quickly without building/maintaining infrastructure.

### 1.2 Direct broker integrations

- **Flow**: TradingView webhook → broker REST/WebSocket API → order placement.
- **Strengths**: Executes directly on the broker without MT5 in the loop, potentially lower latency.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires broker that exposes an accessible API, custom order-mapping logic per broker.
- **Recommended use**: When the broker relationship and compliance requirements allow bypassing MT5 entirely.

### 1.3 Custom Python bridge

- **Flow**: TradingView webhook → Python service (FastAPI/Flask) → MT5 terminal via `MetaTrader5` (Python) API.
- **Strengths**: Full control over risk filters, logging, persistence, and routing logic.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires hosting (VPS or container), MT5 terminal must run alongside the bridge, ongoing maintenance.
- **Recommended use**: When you need extensible business logic or integration with internal systems and are comfortable operating infrastructure.

## 2. Implementation Tracks

Pick the track that aligns with your requirements. Each option assumes you test end-to-end using demo accounts before trading live funds.

### 2.1 Managed cloud bridge + Next.js dashboard

1. **Provision the bridge**
   - Sign up for the service (e.g., WebhookTrade) and connect MT5 credentials using their secure onboarding workflow.
   - Obtain the webhook URL or email address that the vendor exposes for TradingView alerts.

2. **Configure TradingView alerts**
   - Normalize the alert message into JSON (symbol, action, size, optional metadata) so downstream systems can parse it reliably.
   - Embed unique identifiers (strategy id, alert id) for traceability in the dashboard.

3. **Build the Next.js dashboard**
   - Fetch trade history and execution status from the vendor API (if available) or sync email/webhook confirmations into your own datastore.
   - Expose status tiles (connected accounts, alert health) and historical tables/graphs for operations teams.
   - Use server actions or API routes to manage user configuration (e.g., toggling strategies on/off) and persist preferences in Supabase or another managed database.

4. **Operationalize**
   - Document the vendor SLA/limits and align monitoring to their status endpoints.
   - Store credentials and API keys in a secrets manager; never commit them to source control.

### 2.2 Custom Python bridge + Next.js dashboard

1. **TradingView webhook receiver**
   - Stand up a FastAPI or Flask application with a `/alerts` endpoint that validates a shared secret and parses JSON payloads.
   - Implement idempotency using alert identifiers to avoid duplicate trades.
   - Persist payloads to a queue or database table for auditing and replay.

2. **Execution worker (MT5)**
   - Run the Python bridge on the same machine as the MT5 terminal or via LAN with proper authentication.
   - Use the `MetaTrader5` Python package to log in, map symbols, size orders, and submit trades.
   - Apply risk filters (max exposure, spread checks) before execution and capture broker responses.
   - Publish execution outcomes (filled, rejected, errors) back to the datastore for monitoring.

3. **Next.js control surface**
   - Expose REST endpoints or WebSockets (via the Python service or Supabase Realtime) that the Next.js app can subscribe to for live updates.
   - Implement pages for:
     - Strategy configuration (webhook secrets, sizing rules, schedules).
     - Signal inbox (incoming alerts with status).
     - Execution log (orders, fills, latency metrics).
   - Secure the dashboard with role-based access (e.g., NextAuth + Supabase, or custom JWT flow).

4. **Infrastructure & reliability**
   - Deploy the Python bridge on a hardened VPS with MT5 auto-start scripts.
   - Containerize services where possible and set up process monitors (systemd, PM2, or Supervisor).
   - Implement centralized logging (e.g., Loki, CloudWatch) and alerting for failures or latency spikes.

## 3. Development Workflow Tips

- **Source control alignment**: Keep Pine Script, webhook handlers, and EA code in dedicated folders (see `algorithms/` and `dynamic_trading_language/`) to preserve discoverability.
- **Testing**: Backtest Pine Scripts before enabling alerts, then run demo account simulations to validate order routing.
- **Environment separation**: Maintain distinct webhook endpoints and MT5 terminals for staging vs. production to avoid cross-environment contamination.
- **Telemetry**: Track metrics such as alert throughput, order latency, win rate, and error codes; visualize them on the Next.js dashboard.
- **Security**: Restrict inbound traffic to the webhook receiver via IP allowlists or zero-trust proxies. Rotate shared secrets regularly and enforce least privilege on broker credentials.

## 4. When to choose which path

| Requirement | Recommended Path |
| --- | --- |
| Need the fastest deployment with minimal coding | Managed cloud bridge + dashboard |
| Full control over risk logic, data retention, and integrations | Custom Python bridge |
| Broker offers a first-class API and you prefer to bypass MT5 | Direct broker integration |
| Latency-sensitive strategies where every hop matters | Custom bridge deployed near broker infrastructure |
| Resource-constrained team focused on analytics, not DevOps | Managed cloud bridge |

## 5. Next Steps Checklist

1. Select the architecture that matches your constraints and document the decision.
2. Draft the TradingView alert schema and confirm it covers the required trade metadata.
3. Prototype the bridge (managed or custom) in a demo environment and validate order execution.
4. Scaffold the Next.js dashboard (use `create-next-app@latest`), integrate your datastore, and surface alert + trade telemetry.
5. Run end-to-end tests from alert emission to MT5 execution, logging each hop for post-mortem analysis.
6. Harden security (secrets, TLS, access controls) before enabling real capital.
7. Establish monitoring and operational runbooks for on-call response.

By following this guide, you can pair TradingView’s analytics, MT5’s execution engine, and a Next.js control plane into a cohesive automated trading stack tailored to your team’s requirements.
