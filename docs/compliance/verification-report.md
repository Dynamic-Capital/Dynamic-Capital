# Compliance Alignment Audit

## Scope

This audit evaluates whether the Dynamic Capital repository currently backs the
compliance posture described in stakeholder guidance. The review focuses on four
control areas:

1. Certificate governance infrastructure
2. Token design and governance emphasis
3. Jurisdictional controls and technical guardrails
4. Ongoing legal and regulatory engagement

## Methodology

- Mapped each control area to the primary repository documents describing the
  policy or process.
- Confirmed that the referenced materials contain concrete evidence (tables,
  workflows, or checklists) that can be inspected by partners or regulators.
- Checked for automation or governance hooks that keep controls current rather
  than aspirational.
- Logged residual risks or follow-up actions when supporting artefacts were
  implicit or require scheduled maintenance.

## Evidence Inventory

| Control Area | Primary Evidence | Supporting Artefacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Certificate governance | [`docs/compliance/README.md`](README.md) | [`docs/compliance/certificates.json`](certificates.json) |
| Token utility & governance | [`docs/dynamic-capital-ton-whitepaper.md`](../dynamic-capital-ton-whitepaper.md) | [`docs/dct-budget-audit.md`](../dct-budget-audit.md) |
| Jurisdictional guardrails | [`docs/tonstarter-launch-readiness.md`](../tonstarter-launch-readiness.md) | [`docs/dynamic-capital-ecosystem-anatomy.md`](../dynamic-capital-ecosystem-anatomy.md) |
| Legal engagement | [`docs/team-operations-algorithm.md`](../team-operations-algorithm.md) | [`docs/dct-budget-audit.md`](../dct-budget-audit.md) |

## Summary of Results

| Control Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Certificate governance | **Effective** | End-to-end inventory, verification workflow, and renewal calendar exist in markdown and JSON for automation. |
| Token utility & governance | **Effective** | Whitepaper and budget audit align utility-first framing with treasury oversight and legal spend guardrails. |
| Jurisdictional guardrails | **Effective** | Launch readiness plan enforces KYC, geofencing, and segregated investor economics, backed by compliance automation in ecosystem design. |
| Legal engagement | **Effective** | Legal advisor SOP and budget audit earmark continuous monitoring, counsel engagement, and evidence logging. |

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Certificate Governance Infrastructure

- `docs/compliance/README.md` maintains a certificate inventory with issuing
  bodies, IDs, and expiration dates plus a machine-readable mirror in
  `docs/compliance/certificates.json`, allowing due diligence portals to ingest
  the same data automatically.
- The README also prescribes a four-step verification workflow and a quarterly
  renewal calendar that distributes surveillance obligations across the year,
  preventing evidence gaps between audits.
- Document control guidance requires Git versioning and portal links for any
  update, providing traceability for auditors reviewing change history.
- **Residual Risk:** No immediate gaps detected; continue mirroring updates into
  `certificates.json` when certificates rotate to keep automation aligned.

### 2. Token Design Emphasis on Utility and Governance

- `docs/dynamic-capital-ton-whitepaper.md` positions DCT strictly as a utility
  asset providing access, fee rebates, liquidity coordination, and governance
  collateral. Governance constraints (time-locked multisig, emission throttles,
  treasury policies) are explicitly documented rather than implied future work.
- Compliance language avoids investment return promises while detailing how
  treasury actions feed buybacks, burns, and staking incentives under DAO
  oversight.
- `docs/dct-budget-audit.md` reinforces the utility posture by routing legal,
  licensing, and operational spend through governance evidence, ensuring budget
  approvals produce audit trails tied to compliance mandates.
- **Residual Risk:** Monitor public communications for consistency with the
  utility narrative to avoid dilution of the non-security positioning.

### 3. Jurisdictional Controls and Technical Guardrails

- `docs/tonstarter-launch-readiness.md` mandates team KYC readiness,
  geography-aware whitelisting, and segregation of investor share economics,
  directly addressing higher-friction jurisdictions before market expansion.
- The action checklist links to vesting audits, liquidity SOPs, and transparency
  cadences that can be inspected by Tonstarter or regulators.
- `docs/dynamic-capital-ecosystem-anatomy.md` embeds compliance automation in the
  Skeleton layer (Dynamic Compliance Algo) and references AML/KYC reporting and
  transparency dashboards, showing that guardrails are part of the core system
  design rather than bolt-on controls.
- **Residual Risk:** Ensure that geofencing logic and KYC tooling remain updated
  with regional policy changes; no gaps identified in documentation.

### 4. Ongoing Legal and Regulatory Engagement

- `docs/team-operations-algorithm.md` assigns the legal advisor daily regulatory
  monitoring duties, weekly compliance guidance, and escalation workflows with
  outside counsel, providing cadence and accountability.
- The SOP requires documentation of automation cues, change logs, and retro
  notes, ensuring legal interventions are observable and repeatable.
- `docs/dct-budget-audit.md` earmarks retained counsel, licensing reviews, and
  compliance data room maintenance as recurring budget obligations tied to
  governance evidence, preventing funding gaps for legal coverage.
- **Residual Risk:** Track counsel engagement metrics (response times, tickets
  closed) to quantify effectiveness. No immediate documentation gaps observed.

## Follow-Up Actions

- Add counsel engagement KPIs to the legal advisor SOP when available to close
  the residual risk noted above.
- Continue quarterly reviews of certificates and geofencing controls; document
  any tooling updates in the compliance runbook for future audits.
