- **Availability:** 24/7 infrastructure monitoring, redundant deployment architecture across Supabase and DigitalOcean regions, and defined incident response SLAs.
- **Confidentiality:** Encryption in transit and at rest, least-privilege access control, and quarterly entitlement reviews documented in the compliance portal.
