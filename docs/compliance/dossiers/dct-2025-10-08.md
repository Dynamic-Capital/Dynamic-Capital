- Treasury operations flagged for liquidity >$10M; monitoring runbook updated under `dynamic_liquidity` control set.
- Refresh pack to include updated audited financials and renewed director passports ahead of 2027 review.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Monitor ongoing screening alerts; escalate via ticketing queue `COMP-ALERTS` on any severity ≥0.5 hits.
2. Validate treasury transaction monitoring outputs after first full month and recalibrate thresholds if anomalies detected.
3. Confirm quarterly that vault archives remain accessible and checksums unchanged.
