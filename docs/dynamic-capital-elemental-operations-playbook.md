# Dynamic Capital Elemental Operations Playbook

This playbook translates the elemental analogy into cadenced operations, owners,
and telemetry so that every Dynamic Capital squad can immediately plug the
framework into sprint planning, reviews, and incident drills.

## Roles & Cadence Legend

- **Owner:** Accountable squad or guild (Bridge, Treasury, Product, Compliance,
  Infrastructure, AI Research).
- **Cadence:** How often the task is executed (D = daily, W = weekly, M =
  monthly, Q = quarterly, A = ad-hoc/triggered).
- **Telemetry:** Primary dashboards, metrics, or documents used to evaluate
  completion.

## 1. Universe → Liquidity & Strategy Reactors

**North Star:** Sustain high-availability liquidity and continuously forge new
alpha streams.

| Element Analogy                    | Task                                                                       | Owner             | Cadence | Telemetry                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Hydrogen & Helium → Core inflows   | Reconcile fiat/TON bridge balances; rotate signer keys when variance >1.5% | Treasury + Bridge | D/W     | Supabase bridge ledger, multisig audit log |
| Stellar Fusion → Multi-LLM foundry | Ship one research-to-production strategy iteration with post-mortem notes  | AI Research       | W       | Strategy release doc, win-rate delta       |
| Supernova → Incident propagation   | Run chaos drill on bridge RPC fallback; update incident library            | Infrastructure    | M       | Grafana SLO reports, updated runbook PR    |

**Escalation Ladder:**

1. Bridge alert (latency > 500ms) → On-call Bridge engineer (PagerDuty).
2. If variance persists > 2 hours → Treasury sign-off to pause intake;
   Compliance notified.
3. Post-incident review within 48 hours with AI Research + Infrastructure to
   capture learnings.

## 2. Life (CHNOPS) → Product Experience & Knowledge

**North Star:** Keep user surfaces breathable, authenticated, and context-rich.

| Oxygen → Observability      | Review alert routing; ensure logs cover 95% of critical paths             | Infrastructure | W       | Alert coverage scorecard             |
| Nitrogen → Knowledge graph  | Publish digest summarizing new docs/runbooks + retire outdated entries    | Knowledge Ops  | W       | Notion changelog                     |
| Phosphorus → Payment energy | Simulate reward disbursement in sandbox before production cycles          | Treasury       | M       | Reward ledger diff                   |
| Sulfur → Security bonds     | Validate RBAC matrix vs. onboarding/offboarding list                      | Compliance     | M       | Access review checklist              |

**User Trust Check:** If NPS drops below 45 or support backlog > 24 hours,
trigger cross-squad review aligning Carbon/Oxygen/Sulfur tasks.
