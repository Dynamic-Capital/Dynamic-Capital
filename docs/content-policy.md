# Content Policy — No Fakes / No Placeholders

**Required** for bios, timelines, claims, metrics:

- Provide at least one source (public link, internal doc, or signed statement)
  in the PR.
- Don’t invent names, roles, employers, accolades, metrics, or dates.
- No placeholders: “John/Jane Doe”, “ACME/Example Corp”, “Noah Sterling”
  (sample), “Helios Partners” (sample), “lorem ipsum”, “TBD/TK/CHANGE ME”,
  example.com, fake phones/emails.
- Any numeric claim (e.g., AUM, members, ROI, volume, % success, revenue)
  **must** include a source and date.
- Bios must reference a canonical person entry (see `content/people.json`) or
  add one with sources.

PRs that violate these rules will be labeled **needs-sources** or **no-fakes**
and must be corrected before merge.
