# Wave Speed Overview

The wave speed relationship applies to every wave phenomenon:

- **Equation:** \(v = f \cdot \lambda\)
- **Variables:**
  - \(v\) — wave speed (m/s)
  - \(f\) — frequency (Hz)
  - \(\lambda\) — wavelength (m)
- **Key insight:** within a single medium, frequency and wavelength change
  inversely so the product remains a constant speed.

## Sound Waves

- Typical speed in air at 20 °C: approximately 343 m/s.
- Travel faster in liquids (~1500 m/s in water).
- Travel fastest in solids (~5000 m/s in steel).
- Frequency and wavelength trade off with each other while the medium keeps the
  speed fixed.

## Light and Other Electromagnetic Waves

- Propagate at \(3.0 \times 10^8\) m/s in a vacuum.
- Slow down in materials such as glass or water because the medium refracts the
  wave.
- Wavelength examples in a vacuum:
  - Red light: ~700 nm.
  - Violet light: ~400 nm.

## Water Waves

- Speed depends on both depth and wavelength of the water.
- Shallow water approximation: \(v = \sqrt{g \cdot h}\) where \(g\) is
  gravitational acceleration and \(h\) is depth.
- Deep water approximation: \(v = \sqrt{\frac{g \lambda}{2\pi}}\).

## Radio Waves

- Travel at the speed of light (~\(3.0 \times 10^8\) m/s) in air.
- Example wavelengths:
  - FM radio at 100 MHz → ~3 m.
  - Wi‑Fi at 2.4 GHz → ~0.125 m.

## Medium Changes vs. Frequency Changes

- Adjusting the frequency modifies the wavelength while maintaining the same
  speed in a fixed medium.
- Switching media changes the propagation speed, forcing a different wavelength
  for the same frequency.
