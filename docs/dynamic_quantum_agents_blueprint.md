# Dynamic Quantum Agents Blueprint

## Executive Snapshot
- Transition the mythic agent cohort into Dynamic Quantum Agents (DQAs) that expose deterministic classical fallbacks while progressively unlocking quantum acceleration.
- Enforce token-gated capability tiers (DCT) so governance-critical flows receive hardened security, attestation, and quorum guarantees.
- Instrument every run with fidelity scoring, resonance deltas, and verifiable attestations that the AGI Oracle can audit and reward.
- Sustain a perpetual back-to-back review loop that couples operational retros with optimization sprints anchored in measurable outcome lifts.

### Conversion Activation Ladder
| Stage | Focus | Gate Condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S0 — Baseline Mapping** | Catalog legacy agents, assign DQA IDs, document classical fallbacks, and align on capability tiers. | All agents mapped with signed fallback certification packets. |
| **S1 — Hybrid Control Plane** | Deploy orchestration, middleware adapters, and observability exporters across tiers. | Control plane observability live; stake-backed provisioning tested end-to-end. |
| **S2 — Quantum Acceleration** | Enable prioritized quantum primitives per agent, calibrate fidelity scoring, and integrate entanglement channels. | ≥70% fidelity across Tier 2 pilots with successful fallback comparisons logged. |
| **S3 — Governance Hardening** | Activate full governance spine, QKD, and ZK attestations while enforcing tier guardrails. | Tier 3 agents sustain ≥0.9 fidelity and pass dual-attested governance drills. |

### Quick-Start Playbook
1. Confirm the activation ladder readiness checklist per agent and obtain Zeus sign-off on tier assignments.
2. Stand up the hybrid control plane (scheduler, middleware, observability) with dry-run jobs from each tier.
3. Configure DCT stake provisioning, calibration scripts, and fallback validation workflows with immutable audit logs.
4. Enable governance and resonance pipelines: ingest fidelity telemetry, oracle reward deltas, and compliance attestations.
5. Launch phased pilots (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3) with explicit exit criteria, rollback protocols, and optimization owners.
6. Operationalize the back-to-back review loop so every rollout sprint ships with paired optimization mandates and evidence packs.

## Agent Registry and Capability Mapping

### Interlock Patterns
- **Governance Spine**: Zeus arbitrates policy changes, Hermes distributes signed directives, and Athena validates ethical alignment pre-deployment.
- **Liquidity Loop**: Poseidon signals market states to Hephaestus for contract crafting while Hermes settles payouts and Ares stress-tests release candidates.
- **Insight Relay**: Apollo, Artemis, and Dionysus feed telemetry into Athena's planning buffers, triggering Demeter reallocation proposals when thresholds are crossed.
- **Community Circuit**: Hera tracks trust signals, relays loyalty deltas to Aphrodite for resonance tuning, and Dionysus amplifies approved narratives across community channels.

### Capability Tier Guardrails
- **Tier 3 (Critical Governance & Payments)**: Dual attestation (Zeus + Hermes) precedes any policy shift or validator change with minimum fidelity ≥ 0.9 and live QKD enforcement.
- **Tier 2 (Market, Trust, Build Systems)**: Daily drift scans compare quantum outputs with classical baselines; stake slashing triggers if divergence exceeds 3σ without remediation inside 24 hours.
- **Tier 1 (Exploratory & Support)**: Operate on rolling 72-hour health checks and publish telemetry snapshots before requesting tier escalation.

## Architecture and Data Flows
### System Layers
1. **Quantum Kernel** – Native quantum circuits, QUBO solvers, QNN layers, and error-mitigation modules.
2. **Classical Control Plane** – Orchestration, scheduling, checkpointing, and logging of hybrid workloads.
3. **Agent Middleware** – Translation layer mapping classical tensors to amplitude encodings while handling serialization and versioning.
4. **Governance Layer** – DCT staking, attestations, and on-chain anchors that secure verifiable agent actions.

### Communication and State Management
- **Entanglement Channels**: Ephemeral entangled sessions for high-integrity oracle assertions and synchronous consensus windows.
- **State Sync**: Hybrid snapshotting where quantum state parameters are checkpointed as classical vectors annotated with fidelity metadata.
- **Message Contracts**: Canonical protobuf schemas with `agent_id`, `task_id`, `quantum_circuit_hash`, `fidelity_score`, `signature`, and optional `fallback_delta` fields.

```protobuf
message DqaResult {
  string agent_id = 1;
  string task_id = 2;
  string quantum_circuit_hash = 3;
  double fidelity_score = 4;
  double fallback_delta = 5;
  bytes signature = 6;
}
```

### Lifecycle Operations
1. **Provisioning** – DCT stake unlocks entanglement quota, compute priority, and sandbox credentials.
2. **Boot** – Load hybrid models, execute calibration cycles, and publish baseline `fidelity_score` attestations.
3. **Tasking** – Submit task payloads containing objectives, constraints, QoS, and budget envelopes; scheduler assigns quantum resources.
4. **Execution** – Run quantum circuits, capture intermediate parameters, and post-process with classical decoders.
5. **Attestation** – Produce signed bundles `{result, circuit_hash, fidelity_score, proof_of_execution}` and store them in the governance ledger.
6. **Ingestion** – The Oracle ingests bundles, updates reputation scores, and triggers stake burns or payouts per DCT policy.

### Outcome Verification
1. **Circuit Registration** – Hash compiled circuits and log metadata with invoking agent ID, tier, and fallback signature.
2. **Dual Execution** – Pair quantum runs with deterministic classical fallbacks to produce comparison deltas and highlight anomaly windows.
3. **Oracle Scoring** – The AGI Oracle ingests both result sets, issues an intelligence resonance delta, and updates the agent reputation ledger.
4. **Continuous Tuning** – Agents adjust hyperparameters, annealing schedules, or fallback weightings based on resonance deltas and publish tuning notes for auditability.

### Training and Continual Learning
- **Federated Hybrid Training**: Local classical updates blend with quantum parameter shifts aggregated via secure MPC, using entangled summary states for bias-reduced averaging.
- **Reward Signals**: The AGI Intelligence Oracle emits scalar rewards; DQAs employ quantum policy gradient approximations for sample-efficient adaptation.
- **Curriculum Scheduling**: Progress from classical tasks to high-fidelity quantum workloads as each agent's `fidelity_score` improves.

## Operational Playbooks
### Runbook Anchors
- **Calibration Windows**: Schedule off-peak calibration cycles for Tier 3 agents twice daily; Tier 1 agents recalibrate weekly unless fidelity variance exceeds 10%.
- **Incident Escalation**: If three consecutive runs fall below thresholds, freeze quantum workloads, trigger classical fallback, and route incidents to Zeus for arbitration.
- **Observability Pipelines**: Stream fidelity, latency, and stake utilization metrics into the governance ledger with alerts tied to Key Metrics targets.
- **Readiness Reviews**: Prior to tier promotion, complete reviews covering stake sufficiency, fallback coverage, and projected resonance lift.
- **Optimization Debriefs**: Close each sprint with cross-tier retros on resonance deltas, drift alerts, and cost-to-value ratios to set the next optimization sprint.

### Operational Checklist
| Task | Owner | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Confirm DCT stake balances before provisioning new entanglement quotas. | Governance Ops (Zeus) | Before each provisioning window |
| Execute calibration cycle and record baseline `fidelity_score` per agent before task intake resumes. | Reliability Crew | Start of every shift |
| Validate classical fallback pipelines by running the deterministic regression suite. | Reliability Crew + Agent Owners | Weekly or after code changes |
| Review Hermes routing and Zeus governance signatures after every incident escalation. | Governance Ops + Network Security | Post-incident |
| Publish observability snapshots (fidelity, latency, stake utilization) to the governance ledger. | Observability Team | Each epoch |
| Reconcile resonance deltas against oracle baselines and file optimization actions. | Strategy PMO (Athena) | Weekly sync |
| Host cross-agent retro to review resonance, cost, and incident learnings; log action owners. | All Tier Leads | Bi-weekly |

### Back-to-Back Review & Optimization Loop
#### Cadence Matrix
| Tier | Review Window | Optimization Focus | Required Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 3 | Twice per week | Governance latency tuning, validator integrity, QKD resilience | Dual attestation logs, QKD health report, resonance delta summary |
| Tier 2 | Weekly | Market/trust accuracy, contract throughput, adversarial readiness | Drift comparison sheets, fallback validation results, cost-to-value snapshot |
| Tier 1 | Bi-weekly | Discovery throughput, UX resonance, narrative alignment | Telemetry rollups, anomaly heatmaps, stakeholder feedback digest |

#### Closed-Loop Procedure
1. **Prep** – Curate metrics, incidents, and experiment notes into an evidence pack tied to the upcoming review window.
2. **Review** – Convene cross-agent quorum led by Zeus to evaluate fidelity trends, resonance deltas, and guardrail adherence.
3. **Optimize** – Prioritize remediation and improvement tasks with explicit owners, budgets, and expected resonance lift.
4. **Verify** – Run targeted tests or simulations, record pass/fail status, and update the attestation ledger with signed results.
5. **Publish** – Distribute the optimization changelog, updated metrics, and next review agenda to all tier leads.

#### Automation Hooks
- **Metric Snapshots**: Auto-ingest fidelity, latency, and economic flow metrics into evidence packs four hours before each review.
- **Guardrail Watchers**: Trigger alerts when thresholds (e.g., drift > 3σ, resonance delta < 0) breach, automatically queuing the item for the next optimization huddle.
- **Task Sync**: Push approved optimization actions into the orchestration backlog with references to the originating review decision.

#### Escalation Pathways
- **Critical**: Immediate rollback and Zeus-led council within four hours; applies to Tier 3 guardrail violations or failed attestations.
- **High**: Deploy classical fallbacks and schedule a 24-hour remediation sprint led by the affected agent owner; applies to Tier 2 incidents with revenue or trust impact.
- **Medium**: Log remediation task with 72-hour SLA, maintain quantum operations with heightened monitoring; applies to Tier 1 anomalies or telemetry gaps.
- **Low**: Track as backlog optimization candidate and bundle into the next scheduled review.

#### Evidence Pack Template
1. **Summary Sheet** – Key metric deltas, incidents, and major experiments since the last review.
2. **Guardrail Status** – Table listing each guardrail, current value, threshold, and commentary.
3. **Optimization Log** – Snapshot of in-flight optimization tasks, owner, status, and projected resonance lift.
4. **Verification Artifacts** – Links or hashes to test results, attestations, and fallback certifications executed post-review.
5. **Decision Register** – Approved changes, deferred proposals, and rationale signed by Zeus and relevant tier leads.

## Security, Privacy, and Compliance
### Security Controls
- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** secures Tier 3 agent messaging and validator coordination.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** let DQAs prove circuit outcome classes without exposing internal models.
- **Isolation Boundaries** ensure each DQA runs inside a sandboxed hybrid VM with attested hardware IDs and signed firmware.
- **Secure Circuit Vaults** store compiled quantum templates with hardware binding and tamper-evident logs to prevent drift or unauthorized swaps.

### Compliance Checklist
1. [ ] Verify KMS rotation aligns with QKD key refresh cadence and log attestations on-chain.
2. [ ] Confirm sandbox firmware hashes against the approved manifest before provisioning quantum workloads.
3. [ ] Ensure ZK proof circuits are versioned and backward compatible with governance verification tooling.
4. [ ] Validate tier-specific guardrails (fidelity thresholds, drift limits, review cadences) during quarterly audits.
5. [ ] Archive back-to-back review packets (findings, approved optimizations, verification evidence) in the governance ledger.

## Deployment and Metrics
### Phased Rollout Roadmap
1. Prototype Hermes, Hephaestus, and Zeus as classical-first services with quantum-enabled stubs.
2. Integrate QKD and attestation pipelines for Hermes and Zeus governance flows.
3. Accelerate Athena, Poseidon, and Apollo with quantum-enhanced inference loops.
4. Scale to multi-DQA choreography supported by federated hybrid training and automated evidence packs.

### Optimization Path
- **Phase Gate Reviews**: After each rollout stage, run Zeus-led governance reviews to validate metric deltas and approve new staking thresholds.
- **Model Drift Audits**: Use Athena to benchmark policy outputs quarterly against ethical baselines; route remediation tasks to Hephaestus for pipeline updates.
- **Cost-to-Value Tracking**: Combine entanglement utilization and Oracle Reward Delta to compute return on staked capital, informing future tier adjustments.
- **Resonance Improvement Sprints**: Dedicate fortnightly sprints to the two agents with the largest negative resonance delta, ensuring corrective actions are time-boxed.
- **Playbook Refresh**: Update fallback manifests, observability dashboards, and compliance controls after each major resonance sprint to prevent regression.

### Key Metrics
- **Fidelity Score per run**: Initial target ≥ 0.7 with a goal > 0.9 for Tier 3 agents.
- **Time-to-Decision latency (Zeus DQA)**: SLO < 200 ms for governance windows.
- **Oracle Reward Delta**: Improvement in AGI performance following agent updates.
- **Entanglement Utilization**: Percentage of entanglement capacity consumed each epoch.
- **DCT Economic Flow**: Stake inflow, burns initiated by oracle feedback, and payouts to contributors.
- **Intelligence Resonance Delta**: Rolling average of oracle-issued resonance gains, sliced by agent and tier to spotlight optimization targets.

### Resonance Instrumentation
- Publish a tier-segmented dashboard combining fidelity, resonance, and fallback delta to surface underperforming agents quickly.
- Track variance between quantum and classical outputs with heatmaps that feed automation hooks for review queueing.
- Maintain a living decision log linking optimization tasks to subsequent resonance shifts to quantify the impact of each sprint.
