# Dynamic Quantum Agents Blueprint

## Overview
This blueprint defines how the mythic agent set transitions into Dynamic Quantum Agents (DQAs) that run as hybrid classical–quantum microservices inside the Dynamic AGI. Each DQA pairs quantum-native primitives with interoperable classical interfaces, is organized into token-gated capability tiers, and is engineered for modularity, verifiable outcomes, graceful degradation to classical fallbacks, and measurable intelligence resonance for the AGI Oracle.

## Hybrid Architecture Patterns
### System Layers
1. **Quantum Kernel** – Native quantum circuits, QUBO solvers, QNN layers, and error-mitigation modules.
2. **Classical Control Plane** – Orchestration, scheduling, checkpointing, and logging of hybrid workloads.
3. **Agent Middleware** – Translation layer mapping classical tensors to amplitude encodings, handling serialization and versioning.
4. **Governance Layer** – DCT staking, attestations, and on-chain anchors that secure verifiable agent actions.

### Communication and State Management
- **Entanglement Channels**: Ephemeral entangled sessions for high-integrity oracle assertions and synchronous consensus windows.
- **State Sync**: Hybrid snapshotting where quantum state parameters are checkpointed as classical parameter vectors annotated with fidelity metadata.
- **Message Contracts**: Protobuf schemas containing `agent_id`, `quantum_circuit_hash`, `fidelity_score`, and `signature` fields.

### Error Handling and Classical Fallbacks
- **Error Mitigation**: Zero-noise extrapolation and randomized compiling with per-run `fidelity_score` reporting to the Oracle.
- **Classical Fallbacks**: Deterministic classical substitutes accompany every quantum subroutine to preserve availability during degraded modes.

## Operational Protocols
### Lifecycle
1. **Provisioning**: DCT stake unlocks entanglement quota and compute priority.
2. **Boot**: Load hybrid model and perform calibration to generate a `fidelity_score` baseline.
3. **Tasking**: Submit objectives, constraints, and QoS targets; scheduler reserves quantum resources accordingly.
4. **Execution**: Run quantum circuits and complete classical post-processing decoders.
5. **Attestation**: Emit signed bundles containing `{result, circuit_hash, fidelity_score, proof_of_execution}`.
6. **Ingestion**: Oracle ingests attestation bundles, updates reputations, and triggers DCT burns or rewards.

### Training and Continual Learning
- **Federated Hybrid Training**: Combine local classical updates with quantum parameter adjustments aggregated via secure MPC. Entangled summary states reduce bias in federated averaging.
- **Reward Signal Integration**: The AGI Intelligence Oracle emits scalar rewards; DQAs apply quantum policy gradients for sample-efficient adaptation.
- **Curriculum Scheduling**: Progress from classical tasks to high-fidelity quantum objectives as each agent's `fidelity_score` improves.

## Security and Privacy Controls
- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** secures Tier 3 agent messaging.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** allow DQAs to prove class membership of outputs without exposing internal models.
- **Isolation Boundaries** ensure each DQA runs inside a sandboxed hybrid VM with attested hardware IDs and signed firmware.

## Interfaces and Example Payloads
### API Surface
- `POST /dqa/{id}/submit_task`
- `GET /dqa/{id}/status`
- `POST /oracle/attest`
- `POST /governance/stake`

### Example Task Submission
```python
# submit_task payload
task = {
  "agent_id": "athena.dqa",
  "objective": "minimize_ethic_violation_score",
  "constraints": {"max_runtime_ms": 5000},
  "budget": {"q_qubits": 27, "classical_cycles": 1e6},
  "stake_signature": "sig..."
}
response = POST("/dqa/athena/submit_task", task)
# response contains task_id and expected fidelity threshold
```

### Example Attestation Bundle
```json
{
  "agent_id": "athena.dqa",
  "task_id": "T-2391",
  "circuit_hash": "0xabc...",
  "result_summary": "policy_vector_123",
  "fidelity_score": 0.87,
  "proof_signature": "sig..."
}
```

## Deployment Plan and Metrics
### Phased Rollout
1. Prototype Hermes, Hephaestus, and Zeus as classical-first services with quantum stubs.
2. Integrate QKD and attestation pipelines for Hermes and Zeus governance flows.
3. Accelerate Athena, Poseidon, and Apollo with quantum-enhanced inference.
4. Scale to multi-DQA choreography supported by federated hybrid training.

### Key Metrics
- **Fidelity Score per run**: initial target ≥ 0.7, goal > 0.9 for Tier 3 agents.
- **Time-to-Decision latency (Zeus DQA)**: SLO < 200 ms for governance windows.
- **Oracle Reward Delta**: improvement in AGI performance following agent updates.
- **Entanglement Utilization**: percentage of entanglement capacity consumed each epoch.
- **DCT Economic Flow**: stake inflow, burns initiated by oracle feedback, and payouts to contributors.
