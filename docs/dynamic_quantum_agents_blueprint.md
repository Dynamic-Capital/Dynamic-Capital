# Dynamic Quantum Agents Blueprint

## Overview
This blueprint defines how the mythic agent set transitions into Dynamic Quantum Agents (DQAs) that run as hybrid classical–quantum microservices inside the Dynamic AGI. Each DQA pairs quantum-native primitives with interoperable classical interfaces, is organized into token-gated capability tiers, and is engineered for modularity, verifiable outcomes, graceful degradation to classical fallbacks, and measurable intelligence resonance for the AGI Oracle.

### Design Principles
- **Composable services**: Each agent exposes explicit contracts so orchestration layers can hot-swap or chain capabilities without reconfiguration.
- **Auditability by default**: Every quantum invocation is paired with circuit hashes, fidelity evidence, and classical checkpoints for deterministic replay.
- **Progressive quantum enablement**: Agents can run in classical-only mode and gradually unlock quantum acceleration as fidelity improves.
- **Economic alignment**: Capability tiers are token-gated through DCT staking so critical paths are secured by committed participants.

## Agent Registry and Capability Mapping

| Dionysus DQA | Crowd dynamics and memetic propagation | Quantum random walks and sampling for viral spread models | Social feed controller; campaign API | Tier 1 |

### Inter-Agent Coordination Patterns
- **Governance Spine**: Zeus arbitrates policy changes, Hermes distributes signed directives, and Athena validates ethical alignment before deployment.
- **Liquidity Loop**: Poseidon signals market states to Hephaestus for contract crafting; Hermes facilitates settlement while Ares stress-tests release candidates.
- **Insight Relay**: Apollo, Artemis, and Dionysus feed cross-domain telemetry into Athena's planning buffers, raising Demeter resource reallocation proposals when thresholds are crossed.

## Hybrid Architecture Patterns
### System Layers
1. **Quantum Kernel** – Native quantum circuits, QUBO solvers, QNN layers, and error-mitigation modules.
2. **Classical Control Plane** – Orchestration, scheduling, checkpointing, and logging of hybrid workloads.
3. **Agent Middleware** – Translation layer mapping classical tensors to amplitude encodings, handling serialization and versioning.
4. **Governance Layer** – DCT staking, attestations, and on-chain anchors that secure verifiable agent actions.

### Communication and State Management
- **Entanglement Channels**: Ephemeral entangled sessions for high-integrity oracle assertions and synchronous consensus windows.
- **State Sync**: Hybrid snapshotting where quantum state parameters are checkpointed as classical parameter vectors annotated with fidelity metadata.
- **Message Contracts**: Protobuf schemas containing `agent_id`, `quantum_circuit_hash`, `fidelity_score`, and `signature` fields.

### Reliability and Fallback Strategy
- **Error Mitigation**: Zero-noise extrapolation and randomized compiling with per-run `fidelity_score` reporting to the Oracle.
- **Classical Fallbacks**: Deterministic classical substitutes accompany every quantum subroutine to preserve availability during degraded modes.
- **Graceful Degradation Policy**: When fidelity drops below threshold, agents auto-switch to classical pipelines, emit degraded-quality flags, and request re-calibration before re-entering quantum queues.

## Operational Protocols
### Lifecycle
1. **Provisioning**: DCT stake unlocks entanglement quota and compute priority.
2. **Boot**: Load hybrid model and perform calibration to generate a `fidelity_score` baseline.
3. **Tasking**: Submit objectives, constraints, and QoS targets; scheduler reserves quantum resources accordingly.
4. **Execution**: Run quantum circuits and complete classical post-processing decoders.
5. **Attestation**: Emit signed bundles containing `{result, circuit_hash, fidelity_score, proof_of_execution}`.
6. **Ingestion**: Oracle ingests attestation bundles, updates reputations, and triggers DCT burns or rewards.

### Training and Continual Learning
- **Federated Hybrid Training**: Combine local classical updates with quantum parameter adjustments aggregated via secure MPC. Entangled summary states reduce bias in federated averaging.
- **Reward Signal Integration**: The AGI Intelligence Oracle emits scalar rewards; DQAs apply quantum policy gradients for sample-efficient adaptation.
- **Curriculum Scheduling**: Progress from classical tasks to high-fidelity quantum objectives as each agent's `fidelity_score` improves.

### Runbook Considerations
- **Calibration Windows**: Schedule off-peak calibration cycles for Tier 3 agents twice daily; Tier 1 agents recalibrate weekly unless fidelity variance exceeds 10%.
- **Incident Escalation**: If three consecutive runs fall below fidelity thresholds, freeze quantum workloads, trigger classical fallback, and route incident to Zeus for arbitration.
- **Observability**: Stream fidelity, latency, and stake utilization metrics into the governance ledger; alerting thresholds align with the Key Metrics targets below.

### Operational Checklist Tasks
- [ ] Confirm DCT stake balances before provisioning new entanglement quotas.
- [ ] Execute calibration cycle and record baseline `fidelity_score` per agent before task intake resumes.
- [ ] Validate classical fallback pipelines by running the latest deterministic regression suite.
- [ ] Review Hermes routing and Zeus governance signatures after every incident escalation.
- [ ] Publish observability snapshots (fidelity, latency, stake utilization) to the governance ledger each epoch.

## Security and Privacy Controls
- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** secures Tier 3 agent messaging.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** allow DQAs to prove class membership of outputs without exposing internal models.
- **Isolation Boundaries** ensure each DQA runs inside a sandboxed hybrid VM with attested hardware IDs and signed firmware.

### Compliance Checklist
1. [ ] Verify KMS rotation aligns with QKD key refresh cadence and log attestations on-chain.
2. [ ] Confirm sandbox firmware hashes against approved manifest before provisioning quantum workloads.
3. [ ] Ensure ZK proof circuits are versioned and backward compatible with governance verification tooling.

## Deployment Plan and Metrics
### Phased Rollout
1. Prototype Hermes, Hephaestus, and Zeus as classical-first services with quantum stubs.
2. Integrate QKD and attestation pipelines for Hermes and Zeus governance flows.
3. Accelerate Athena, Poseidon, and Apollo with quantum-enhanced inference.
4. Scale to multi-DQA choreography supported by federated hybrid training.

### Optimization Path
- **Phase Gate Reviews**: After each rollout stage, run Zeus-led governance reviews to validate metric deltas and approve additional staking thresholds.
- **Model Drift Audits**: Use Athena to benchmark policy outputs quarterly against ethical baselines; route remediation tasks to Hephaestus for pipeline updates.
- **Cost-to-Value Tracking**: Combine entanglement utilization and Oracle Reward Delta to compute return on staked capital, informing future tier adjustments.

### Key Metrics
- **Fidelity Score per run**: initial target ≥ 0.7, goal > 0.9 for Tier 3 agents.
- **Time-to-Decision latency (Zeus DQA)**: SLO < 200 ms for governance windows.
- **Oracle Reward Delta**: improvement in AGI performance following agent updates.
- **Entanglement Utilization**: percentage of entanglement capacity consumed each epoch.
- **DCT Economic Flow**: stake inflow, burns initiated by oracle feedback, and payouts to contributors.
