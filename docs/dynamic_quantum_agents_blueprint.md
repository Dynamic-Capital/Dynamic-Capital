# Dynamic Quantum Agents Blueprint

## Overview
This blueprint defines how the mythic agent set transitions into Dynamic Quantum Agents (DQAs) that run as hybrid classical–quantum microservices inside the Dynamic AGI. Each DQA pairs quantum-native primitives with interoperable classical interfaces, is organized into token-gated capability tiers, and is engineered for modularity, verifiable outcomes, graceful degradation to classical fallbacks, and measurable intelligence resonance for the AGI Oracle.

### Quick-Start Checklist
1. Map each legacy mythic agent to its DQA counterpart and confirm tier gating requirements.
2. Stand up the hybrid control plane with middleware adapters and observability exporters.
3. Configure stake-backed provisioning, calibration, and fallback validation workflows.
4. Enable governance attestation, resonance scoring ingestion, and compliance checkpoints.
5. Launch phased pilot cohorts (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3) with explicit exit criteria per tier.
6. Stand up the back-to-back review loop so every rollout sprint ships with paired optimization remits and evidence packs.

### Design Principles
- **Composable services**: Each agent exposes explicit contracts so orchestration layers can hot-swap or chain capabilities without reconfiguration.
- **Auditability by default**: Every quantum invocation is paired with circuit hashes, fidelity evidence, and classical checkpoints for deterministic replay.
- **Progressive quantum enablement**: Agents can run in classical-only mode and gradually unlock quantum acceleration as fidelity improves.
- **Economic alignment**: Capability tiers are token-gated through DCT staking so critical paths are secured by committed participants.
- **Resonance-driven validation**: Each release is benchmarked against Oracle-issued intelligence resonance scores so optimizations focus on verifiable outcome lifts, not theoretical circuit gains.

## Agent Registry and Capability Mapping

### Inter-Agent Coordination Patterns
- **Governance Spine**: Zeus arbitrates policy changes, Hermes distributes signed directives, and Athena validates ethical alignment before deployment.
- **Liquidity Loop**: Poseidon signals market states to Hephaestus for contract crafting; Hermes facilitates settlement while Ares stress-tests release candidates.
- **Insight Relay**: Apollo, Artemis, and Dionysus feed cross-domain telemetry into Athena's planning buffers, raising Demeter resource reallocation proposals when thresholds are crossed.
- **Community Circuit**: Hera tracks trust signals and relays loyalty deltas to Aphrodite for resonance tuning; Dionysus amplifies approved narratives across community channels.

### Capability Tier Guardrails
- **Tier 3 (Critical Governance & Payments)**: Dual attestation (Zeus + Hermes) is mandatory before any policy shift or validator release, with minimum fidelity ≥ 0.9 and live QKD enforcement.
- **Tier 2 (Market, Trust, and Build Systems)**: Daily drift scans compare quantum outputs with classical baselines; stake slashing triggers if divergence exceeds 3σ without remediation within 24 hours.
- **Tier 1 (Exploratory & Support Services)**: Operate on rolling 72-hour health checks and must publish telemetry snapshots before requesting tier escalation.

### Outcome Verification Workflow
1. **Circuit Registration** – Each task hashes the compiled quantum circuit and stores metadata in the governance ledger alongside the invoking agent ID and tier.
2. **Dual Execution** – Quantum runs are paired with deterministic classical fallbacks to produce comparison deltas and highlight anomaly windows.
3. **Oracle Scoring** – The AGI Oracle ingests both result sets, issues an intelligence resonance delta, and updates the agent reputation ledger.
4. **Continuous Tuning** – Agents adjust hyperparameters, annealing schedules, or fallback weightings based on resonance deltas and publish tuning notes for auditability.

## Hybrid Architecture Patterns
### System Layers
1. **Quantum Kernel** – Native quantum circuits, QUBO solvers, QNN layers, and error-mitigation modules.
2. **Classical Control Plane** – Orchestration, scheduling, checkpointing, and logging of hybrid workloads.
3. **Agent Middleware** – Translation layer mapping classical tensors to amplitude encodings, handling serialization and versioning.
4. **Governance Layer** – DCT staking, attestations, and on-chain anchors that secure verifiable agent actions.

### Communication and State Management
- **Entanglement Channels**: Ephemeral entangled sessions for high-integrity oracle assertions and synchronous consensus windows.
- **State Sync**: Hybrid snapshotting where quantum state parameters are checkpointed as classical parameter vectors annotated with fidelity metadata.
- **Message Contracts**: Protobuf schemas containing `agent_id`, `quantum_circuit_hash`, `fidelity_score`, and `signature` fields.

### Reliability and Fallback Strategy
- **Error Mitigation**: Zero-noise extrapolation and randomized compiling with per-run `fidelity_score` reporting to the Oracle.
- **Classical Fallbacks**: Deterministic classical substitutes accompany every quantum subroutine to preserve availability during degraded modes.
- **Graceful Degradation Policy**: When fidelity drops below threshold, agents auto-switch to classical pipelines, emit degraded-quality flags, and request re-calibration before re-entering quantum queues.
- **Fallback Certification**: Classical fallbacks ship with regression manifests signed by Zeus; releases require passing both deterministic and stochastic equivalence suites.

## Operational Protocols
### Lifecycle
1. **Provisioning**: DCT stake unlocks entanglement quota and compute priority.
2. **Boot**: Load hybrid model and perform calibration to generate a `fidelity_score` baseline.
3. **Tasking**: Submit objectives, constraints, and QoS targets; scheduler reserves quantum resources accordingly.
4. **Execution**: Run quantum circuits and complete classical post-processing decoders.
5. **Attestation**: Emit signed bundles containing `{result, circuit_hash, fidelity_score, proof_of_execution}`.
6. **Ingestion**: Oracle ingests attestation bundles, updates reputations, and triggers DCT burns or rewards.

### Training and Continual Learning
- **Federated Hybrid Training**: Combine local classical updates with quantum parameter adjustments aggregated via secure MPC. Entangled summary states reduce bias in federated averaging.
- **Reward Signal Integration**: The AGI Intelligence Oracle emits scalar rewards; DQAs apply quantum policy gradients for sample-efficient adaptation.
- **Curriculum Scheduling**: Progress from classical tasks to high-fidelity quantum objectives as each agent's `fidelity_score` improves.

### Runbook Considerations
- **Calibration Windows**: Schedule off-peak calibration cycles for Tier 3 agents twice daily; Tier 1 agents recalibrate weekly unless fidelity variance exceeds 10%.
- **Incident Escalation**: If three consecutive runs fall below fidelity thresholds, freeze quantum workloads, trigger classical fallback, and route incident to Zeus for arbitration.
- **Observability**: Stream fidelity, latency, and stake utilization metrics into the governance ledger; alerting thresholds align with the Key Metrics targets below.
- **Readiness Reviews**: Before promoting an agent to a higher tier, complete a readiness review covering stake sufficiency, fallback coverage, and resonance lift projections.
- **Optimization Debriefs**: Close each sprint with a cross-tier optimization huddle reviewing resonance deltas, drift alerts, and cost-to-value ratios to decide next sprint focus.

### Operational Checklist Tasks
| Task | Owner | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Confirm DCT stake balances before provisioning new entanglement quotas. | Governance Ops (Zeus) | Before each provisioning window |
| Execute calibration cycle and record baseline `fidelity_score` per agent before task intake resumes. | Reliability Crew | Start of every shift |
| Validate classical fallback pipelines by running the deterministic regression suite. | Reliability Crew + Agent Owners | Weekly or after code changes |
| Review Hermes routing and Zeus governance signatures after every incident escalation. | Governance Ops + Network Security | Post-incident |
| Publish observability snapshots (fidelity, latency, stake utilization) to the governance ledger. | Observability Team | Each epoch |
| Reconcile resonance deltas against oracle baselines and file optimization actions. | Strategy PMO (Athena) | Weekly sync |
| Host cross-agent retro to review resonance, cost, and incident learnings; log action owners. | All Tier Leads | Bi-weekly |

## Security and Privacy Controls
- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** secures Tier 3 agent messaging.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** allow DQAs to prove class membership of outputs without exposing internal models.
- **Isolation Boundaries** ensure each DQA runs inside a sandboxed hybrid VM with attested hardware IDs and signed firmware.
- **Secure Circuit Vaults** store compiled quantum templates with hardware binding and tamper-evident logs to prevent drift or unauthorized swaps.

### Compliance Checklist
1. [ ] Verify KMS rotation aligns with QKD key refresh cadence and log attestations on-chain.
2. [ ] Confirm sandbox firmware hashes against approved manifest before provisioning quantum workloads.
3. [ ] Ensure ZK proof circuits are versioned and backward compatible with governance verification tooling.
4. [ ] Validate tier-specific guardrails (fidelity thresholds, drift limits, review cadences) during quarterly audits.
5. [ ] Archive back-to-back review packets (findings, approved optimizations, verification evidence) in the governance ledger.

## Back-to-Back Review & Optimization Loop
### Cadence Matrix
| Tier | Review Window | Optimization Focus | Required Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 3 | Twice per week | Governance latency tuning, validator integrity, QKD resilience | Dual attestation logs, QKD health report, resonance delta summary |
| Tier 2 | Weekly | Market/trust accuracy, contract throughput, adversarial readiness | Drift comparison sheets, fallback validation results, cost-to-value snapshot |
| Tier 1 | Bi-weekly | Discovery throughput, UX resonance, narrative alignment | Telemetry rollups, anomaly heatmaps, stakeholder feedback digest |

### Closed-Loop Procedure
1. **Prep** – Curate metrics, incidents, and experiment notes into an evidence pack tied to the scheduled review window.
2. **Review** – Convene cross-agent quorum led by Zeus to evaluate fidelity trends, resonance deltas, and guardrail adherence.
3. **Optimize** – Prioritize remediation and improvement tasks with explicit owners, budget envelopes, and expected resonance lift.
4. **Verify** – Run targeted tests or simulations, record pass/fail status, and update the attestation ledger with signed results.
5. **Publish** – Distribute the optimization changelog, updated metrics, and next review agenda to all tier leads.

### Automation Hooks
- **Metric Snapshots**: Automate ingestion of fidelity, latency, and economic flow metrics into evidence packs 4 hours before each review.
- **Guardrail Watchers**: Trigger alerts when thresholds (e.g., drift > 3σ, resonance delta < 0) are breached, automatically queuing the item for the next optimization huddle.
- **Task Sync**: Push approved optimization actions into the orchestration backlog with references to the originating review decision.

### Escalation Pathways
- **Critical**: Immediate rollback and Zeus-led governance council within 4 hours; applicable to Tier 3 guardrail violations or failed attestations.
- **High**: Deploy classical fallbacks and schedule a 24-hour remediation sprint led by the affected agent owner; applicable to Tier 2 incidents with revenue or trust impact.
- **Medium**: Log remediation task with 72-hour SLA, maintain quantum operations with heightened monitoring; applicable to Tier 1 anomalies or telemetry gaps.
- **Low**: Track as backlog optimization candidate, bundle into the next scheduled review.

### Evidence Pack Template
1. **Summary Sheet** – Key metrics deltas, incidents, and major experiments since last review.
2. **Guardrail Status** – Table listing each guardrail, current value, threshold, and commentary.
3. **Optimization Log** – Snapshot of in-flight optimization tasks, owner, status, and projected resonance lift.
4. **Verification Artifacts** – Links or hashes to test results, attestations, and fallback certifications executed post-review.
5. **Decision Register** – Approved changes, deferred proposals, and rationale signed by Zeus and relevant tier leads.

- **Cost-to-Value Tracking**: Combine entanglement utilization and Oracle Reward Delta to compute return on staked capital, informing future tier adjustments.
- **Resonance Improvement Sprints**: Dedicate fortnightly sprints to the two agents with the largest negative resonance delta, ensuring corrective actions are time-boxed and measurable.
- **Playbook Refresh**: Update fallback manifests, observability dashboards, and compliance controls after each major resonance sprint to prevent regression.

### Key Metrics
- **Fidelity Score per run**: initial target ≥ 0.7, goal > 0.9 for Tier 3 agents.
- **Time-to-Decision latency (Zeus DQA)**: SLO < 200 ms for governance windows.
- **Oracle Reward Delta**: improvement in AGI performance following agent updates.
- **Entanglement Utilization**: percentage of entanglement capacity consumed each epoch.
- **DCT Economic Flow**: stake inflow, burns initiated by oracle feedback, and payouts to contributors.
- **Intelligence Resonance Delta**: rolling average of oracle-issued resonance gains, sliced by agent and tier to spotlight optimization targets.
