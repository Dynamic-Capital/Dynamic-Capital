# Dynamic Quantum Agents Blueprint

## Overview

This blueprint defines how the mythic agent set transitions into Dynamic Quantum
Agents (DQAs) that run as hybrid classical–quantum microservices inside the
Dynamic AGI. Each DQA pairs quantum-native primitives with interoperable
classical interfaces, is organized into token-gated capability tiers, and is
engineered for modularity, verifiable outcomes, graceful degradation to
classical fallbacks, and measurable intelligence resonance for the AGI Oracle.

### Design Principles

- **Composable services**: Each agent exposes explicit contracts so
  orchestration layers can hot-swap or chain capabilities without
  reconfiguration.
- **Auditability by default**: Every quantum invocation is paired with circuit
  hashes, fidelity evidence, and classical checkpoints for deterministic replay.
- **Progressive quantum enablement**: Agents can run in classical-only mode and
  gradually unlock quantum acceleration as fidelity improves.
- **Economic alignment**: Capability tiers are token-gated through DCT staking
  so critical paths are secured by committed participants.
- **Resonance-driven validation**: Each release is benchmarked against
  Oracle-issued intelligence resonance scores so optimizations focus on
  verifiable outcome lifts, not theoretical circuit gains.

### Inter-Agent Coordination Patterns

- **Governance Spine**: Zeus arbitrates policy changes, Hermes distributes
  signed directives, and Athena validates ethical alignment before deployment.
- **Liquidity Loop**: Poseidon signals market states to Hephaestus for contract
  crafting; Hermes facilitates settlement while Ares stress-tests release
  candidates.
- **Insight Relay**: Apollo, Artemis, and Dionysus feed cross-domain telemetry
  into Athena's planning buffers, raising Demeter resource reallocation
  proposals when thresholds are crossed.

### Capability Tier Guardrails

- **Tier 3 (Critical Governance & Payments)**: Dual attestation (Zeus + Hermes)
  is mandatory before any policy shift or validator release, with minimum
  fidelity ≥ 0.9 and live QKD enforcement.
- **Tier 2 (Market, Trust, and Build Systems)**: Daily drift scans compare
  quantum outputs with classical baselines; stake slashing triggers if
  divergence exceeds 3σ without remediation within 24 hours.
- **Tier 1 (Exploratory & Support Services)**: Operate on rolling 72-hour health
  checks and must publish telemetry snapshots before requesting tier escalation.

### Outcome Verification Workflow

1. **Circuit Registration** – Each task hashes the compiled quantum circuit and
   stores metadata in the governance ledger alongside the invoking agent ID and
   tier.
2. **Dual Execution** – Quantum runs are paired with deterministic classical
   fallbacks to produce comparison deltas and highlight anomaly windows.
3. **Oracle Scoring** – The AGI Oracle ingests both result sets, issues an
   intelligence resonance delta, and updates the agent reputation ledger.
4. **Continuous Tuning** – Agents adjust hyperparameters, annealing schedules,
   or fallback weightings based on resonance deltas and publish tuning notes for
   auditability.

## Inter-Agent Communication Protocols

Dynamic Quantum Agents coordinate over a layered stack that blends entanglement
primitives with dependable classical transports. The stack provides
deterministic fallbacks, measurable fidelity monitoring, and tiered access
aligned to each DQA's responsibility.

### Core Protocol Stack

- **Quantum – Entanglement-Based Messaging (EBM)**
  - _Purpose_: State synchronization
  - _Key features_: Bell measurements with no classical channel.
- **Quantum – Quantum Teleportation Protocol (QTP)**
  - _Purpose_: State transfer
  - _Key features_: Classical side-channel communicates Bell results.
- **Hybrid – Quantum-Classical Message Bus (QCMB)**
  - _Purpose_: Inter-agent messaging
  - _Key features_: JSON envelopes that embed serialized quantum circuits.
- **Classical – gRPC / QStream**
  - _Purpose_: RPC coordination
  - _Key features_: HTTP/2 transport, bidirectional streaming, protocol buffers.
- **Classical – WebSocket / QChannel**
  - _Purpose_: Real-time updates
  - _Key features_: Binary + JSON payloads enriched with quantum-state metadata.

### Agent-Specific Communication Patterns

#### Zeus — Governance & Coordination (Tier 3)

```protobuf
service ZeusGovernance {
  rpc QuantumConsensus(ConsensusRequest) returns (ConsensusProof);
  rpc ValidateOracle(OracleData) returns (ValidationAttestation);
  rpc PolicyUpdate(PolicyDelta) returns (PolicyAck);
}

message ConsensusRequest {
  repeated AgentVote votes = 1;
  bytes quantum_proof = 2;  // QFT validation result
  string quorum_level = 3;  // Tier 3 requirement
}
```

#### Hera — Social Trust Network (Tier 2)

```protobuf
service HeraTrust {
  rpc UpdateReputation(ReputationUpdate) returns (TrustScore);
  rpc GetLoyaltyGraph(LoyaltyQuery) returns (QuantumGraph);
}

message ReputationUpdate {
  string agent_id = 1;
  map<string, double> trust_metrics = 2;
  bytes amplitude_encoding = 3;  // Quantum relationship tensor
}
```

#### Poseidon → Apollo — Financial Data Pipeline (Tier 2)

- **Protocol**: Quantum-enhanced WebSocket
- **Data**: Market feeds and volatility surfaces
- **Synchronization**: Quantum phase estimation for precise time alignment

```json
{
  "sender": "poseidon",
  "receiver": "apollo",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "quantum_signature": "bell_state_measurement",
  "payload": {
    "liquidity_map": "quantum_circuit_embedding",
    "volatility_surface": "variational_result",
    "confidence_interval": 0.95
  }
}
```

### Quantum-Specific Coordination Methods

- **Entanglement-based coordination**
  - Artemis → Ares: Shared entanglement to amplify anomaly detection
  - Athena → Zeus: Bell-state alignment for ethical policy enforcement
  - Hermes backbone: Quantum repeaters for tamper-proof delivery
- **Quantum state synchronization** uses shared Bell pairs and phase correction
  routines to keep paired agents in calibrated states:

```python
class QuantumStateSync:
    def synchronize_agents(agent_a: DQA, agent_b: DQA):
        # Establish entanglement channel
        bell_pair = create_bell_state()
        agent_a.entangle(bell_pair[0])
        agent_b.entangle(bell_pair[1])

        # Measure and correct phase
        correction = agent_a.measure_phase()
        agent_b.apply_correction(correction)
```

- **Quantum key distribution (Hermes Network)** leverages BB84 or E91 for
  payment rails and encrypted directives, with post-quantum classical fallbacks
  when fidelity dips below threshold.

### Tier-Based Communication Matrix

| From / To | Zeus (T3)     | Hera (T2)      | Poseidon (T2)   | Artemis (T1)       |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Zeus      | —             | Policy gRPC    | Governance QCMB | Signed directives  |
| Hera      | Trust reports | —              | Social metrics  | Reputation updates |
| Poseidon  | Risk alerts   | Market data    | —               | Liquidity signals  |
| Artemis   | Edge alerts   | Discovery data | Anomaly feeds   | —                  |

### Message Priority and Quality of Service

1. **P0 — Quantum Critical**: Entanglement synchronization, security breaches
2. **P1 — Governance**: Policy updates, oracle validation flows
3. **P2 — Operational**: Market data, trust graph updates
4. **P3 — Analytical**: Forecasting, strategy refinement

Quality of service is tuned per channel:

- **Low latency**: WebSocket + UDP for Artemis and Hermes sensing loops
- **High reliability**: gRPC + TCP for Zeus and Athena governance contracts
- **Batch processing**: Asynchronous queues for Apollo and Demeter analytics

### Error Handling and Recovery

Quantum channels monitor fidelity and automatically re-negotiate entanglement
before falling back to classical mirrors.

```python
class QuantumErrorRecovery:
    def handle_decoherence(message: QuantumMessage):
        if message.fidelity < threshold:
            # Re-establish entanglement
            new_channel = establish_quantum_channel()
            # Retry with classical backup
            return self.retry_with_classical(message)
```

Classical fallbacks include circuit breakers for hardware outages, consensus
reruns without quantum acceleration, and cached last-known-good states.

### Security and Access Control

```protobuf
message QuantumSignedMessage {
  bytes payload = 1;
  bytes quantum_signature = 2;  // Derived from shared entanglement
  string classical_digest = 3;  // SHA-3 fallback
  uint64 nonce = 4;            // Quantum random number
}
```

- **Tier 3** agents hold full quantum-classical privileges.
- **Tier 2** agents receive scoped quantum operations tied to their domain.
- **Tier 1** agents maintain classical cores with quantum sensing overlays.

### Implementation Recommendations

1. Begin with hybrid deployments that prioritize classical reliability before
   layering on quantum channels.
2. Define message schemas in Protocol Buffers and share circuit payloads using
   OpenQASM 3.0 serialization.
3. Instrument fidelity metrics for each quantum link and trigger automated
   renegotiation when thresholds are crossed.
4. Support simulated and hardware quantum backends to keep CI reproducible.

## Hybrid Architecture Patterns

### System Layers

1. **Quantum Kernel** – Native quantum circuits, QUBO solvers, QNN layers, and
   error-mitigation modules.
2. **Classical Control Plane** – Orchestration, scheduling, checkpointing, and
   logging of hybrid workloads.
3. **Agent Middleware** – Translation layer mapping classical tensors to
   amplitude encodings, handling serialization and versioning.
4. **Governance Layer** – DCT staking, attestations, and on-chain anchors that
   secure verifiable agent actions.

### Communication and State Management

- **Entanglement Channels**: Ephemeral entangled sessions for high-integrity
  oracle assertions and synchronous consensus windows.
- **State Sync**: Hybrid snapshotting where quantum state parameters are
  checkpointed as classical parameter vectors annotated with fidelity metadata.
- **Message Contracts**: Protobuf schemas containing `agent_id`,
  `quantum_circuit_hash`, `fidelity_score`, and `signature` fields.

### Reliability and Fallback Strategy

- **Error Mitigation**: Zero-noise extrapolation and randomized compiling with
  per-run `fidelity_score` reporting to the Oracle.
- **Classical Fallbacks**: Deterministic classical substitutes accompany every
  quantum subroutine to preserve availability during degraded modes.
- **Graceful Degradation Policy**: When fidelity drops below threshold, agents
  auto-switch to classical pipelines, emit degraded-quality flags, and request
  re-calibration before re-entering quantum queues.

## Operational Protocols

### Lifecycle

1. **Provisioning**: DCT stake unlocks entanglement quota and compute priority.
2. **Boot**: Load hybrid model and perform calibration to generate a
   `fidelity_score` baseline.
3. **Tasking**: Submit objectives, constraints, and QoS targets; scheduler
   reserves quantum resources accordingly.
4. **Execution**: Run quantum circuits and complete classical post-processing
   decoders.
5. **Attestation**: Emit signed bundles containing
   `{result, circuit_hash, fidelity_score, proof_of_execution}`.
6. **Ingestion**: Oracle ingests attestation bundles, updates reputations, and
   triggers DCT burns or rewards.

### Training and Continual Learning

- **Federated Hybrid Training**: Combine local classical updates with quantum
  parameter adjustments aggregated via secure MPC. Entangled summary states
  reduce bias in federated averaging.
- **Reward Signal Integration**: The AGI Intelligence Oracle emits scalar
  rewards; DQAs apply quantum policy gradients for sample-efficient adaptation.
- **Curriculum Scheduling**: Progress from classical tasks to high-fidelity
  quantum objectives as each agent's `fidelity_score` improves.

### Runbook Considerations

- **Calibration Windows**: Schedule off-peak calibration cycles for Tier 3
  agents twice daily; Tier 1 agents recalibrate weekly unless fidelity variance
  exceeds 10%.
- **Incident Escalation**: If three consecutive runs fall below fidelity
  thresholds, freeze quantum workloads, trigger classical fallback, and route
  incident to Zeus for arbitration.
- **Observability**: Stream fidelity, latency, and stake utilization metrics
  into the governance ledger; alerting thresholds align with the Key Metrics
  targets below.

### Operational Checklist Tasks

| Execute calibration cycle and record baseline `fidelity_score` per agent before task intake resumes. | Reliability Crew                  | Start of every shift            |
| Validate classical fallback pipelines by running the deterministic regression suite.                 | Reliability Crew + Agent Owners   | Weekly or after code changes    |
| Review Hermes routing and Zeus governance signatures after every incident escalation.                | Governance Ops + Network Security | Post-incident                   |
| Publish observability snapshots (fidelity, latency, stake utilization) to the governance ledger.     | Observability Team                | Each epoch                      |
| Reconcile resonance deltas against oracle baselines and file optimization actions.                   | Strategy PMO (Athena)             | Weekly sync                     |

## Security and Privacy Controls

- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** secures Tier 3 agent messaging.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** allow DQAs to prove class membership of outputs
  without exposing internal models.
- **Isolation Boundaries** ensure each DQA runs inside a sandboxed hybrid VM
  with attested hardware IDs and signed firmware.
- **Secure Circuit Vaults** store compiled quantum templates with hardware
  binding and tamper-evident logs to prevent drift or unauthorized swaps.

### Compliance Checklist

1. [ ] Verify KMS rotation aligns with QKD key refresh cadence and log
       attestations on-chain.
2. [ ] Confirm sandbox firmware hashes against approved manifest before
       provisioning quantum workloads.
3. [ ] Ensure ZK proof circuits are versioned and backward compatible with
       governance verification tooling.

   quantum stubs.
2. Integrate QKD and attestation pipelines for Hermes and Zeus governance flows.
3. Accelerate Athena, Poseidon, and Apollo with quantum-enhanced inference.
4. Scale to multi-DQA choreography supported by federated hybrid training.

### Optimization Path

- **Phase Gate Reviews**: After each rollout stage, run Zeus-led governance
  reviews to validate metric deltas and approve additional staking thresholds.
- **Model Drift Audits**: Use Athena to benchmark policy outputs quarterly
  against ethical baselines; route remediation tasks to Hephaestus for pipeline
  updates.
- **Cost-to-Value Tracking**: Combine entanglement utilization and Oracle Reward
  Delta to compute return on staked capital, informing future tier adjustments.
- **Resonance Improvement Sprints**: Dedicate fortnightly sprints to the two
  agents with the largest negative resonance delta, ensuring corrective actions
  are time-boxed and measurable.

### Key Metrics

- **Fidelity Score per run**: initial target ≥ 0.7, goal > 0.9 for Tier 3
  agents.
- **Time-to-Decision latency (Zeus DQA)**: SLO < 200 ms for governance windows.
- **Oracle Reward Delta**: improvement in AGI performance following agent
  updates.
- **Entanglement Utilization**: percentage of entanglement capacity consumed
  each epoch.
- **DCT Economic Flow**: stake inflow, burns initiated by oracle feedback, and
  payouts to contributors.
- **Intelligence Resonance Delta**: rolling average of oracle-issued resonance
  gains, sliced by agent and tier to spotlight optimization targets.
