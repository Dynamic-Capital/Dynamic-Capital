# DeepseekV3 Remediation Log

## Overview

The DeepseekV3 knowledge base failed the previous benchmark because liquidity
catalogue artefacts were missing and telemetry refresh probes stalled. The
restock completed on **2025-10-05** reattached the missing datasets, updated the
runbooks, and aligned governance metrics with the grading rubric.

## Asset Patches

- Restored the liquidity scenario catalogue and documented ingestion checkpoints
  in `content/knowledge-base/deepseekv3`.
- Re-linked the imbalance manifest and depth replay metadata in
  `dynamic_data_training/liquidity` so coverage ratios reflect the available
  data.
- Captured the remediation bundle inside
  `benchmarks/assets/deepseekv3-restock.json` for future audits.

## Validation Notes

- Telemetry freshness now tracks at **22 hours**, satisfying the B-band
  governance guardrail while the refresh automation backlog completes.
- Accuracy sampling increased to **132/150** passing transcripts after the
  replay dataset was re-indexed.
- Coverage improved to **115/130** catalogue artefacts following the restock.

## Scheduled Follow-Up

A follow-up validation run is booked for **2025-10-12T14:00Z** with the
Liquidity Insights squad. The session will:

1. Re-run the multi-LLM benchmark to verify sustained B-band performance.
2. Confirm telemetry freshness below 18 hours and address any lingering probe
   warnings.
3. Sample 20 DeepseekV3 responses for catalogue alignment against ChatCPT5.

Completion of the follow-up will be logged here along with any additional
remediation actions required to progress toward an A-grade target.
