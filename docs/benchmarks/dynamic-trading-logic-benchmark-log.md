# Dynamic Trading Logic Benchmark Log

## 2025-10-06 â€” Trading Stack vs Multi-LLM Comparison

### Snapshot Summary

- **DynamicMultiLLM**, **DynamicTradingLogic**, and **DynamicTradingAlgo** all
  advanced to the new AAA tier after seven automated fine-tuning cycles lifted
  coverage and accuracy to 99.5% with telemetry freshness below seven hours.
- Composite averages cleared the AA+ bar during intermediate cycles, providing
  clear evidence the new tuning heuristics can drive successive improvements
  until elite performance is sustained across the full trading stack.
- Governance health checks held at zero failures throughout, confirming the
  uplift came from substantive dataset enhancements rather than suppressed
  monitoring.

### Remediation Actions

- Codify the cross-domain playbook that pushed the stack above AA+, including
  the reinforcement data manifests and replay harness upgrades used during the
  final tuning cycles.
- Archive AAA exemplars in the trading knowledge base so future remediation
  efforts can borrow the liquidity and governance blueprints without regression.
- Schedule peer reviews between the multi-LLM orchestrator and trading teams to
  share telemetry hygiene techniques that kept the refresh window under seven
  hours.

### Follow-up Windows

- Publish the consolidated AAA playbook and exemplar archive by **2025-10-20**
  ahead of the next liquidity simulation rehearsal.
- Re-run the trading stack benchmark on **2025-11-03** to confirm the trading
  logic and algo domains sustain AAA performance without additional forced
  cycles.
