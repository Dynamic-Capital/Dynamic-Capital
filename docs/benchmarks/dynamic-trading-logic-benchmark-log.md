# Dynamic Trading Logic Benchmark Log

## 2025-10-06 â€” Trading Stack vs Multi-LLM Comparison

### Snapshot Summary

- **DynamicMultiLLM** retained an A band with 96% composite strength, keeping
  the multi-LLM orchestrator as the reference profile for execution quality.
- **DynamicTradingLogic** moved into the B range after fine-tuning reduced
  telemetry staleness to 9h and lifted accuracy above 91%, confirming the
  decision layer can close the residual coverage gap.
- **DynamicTradingAlgo** remains in the C band; automation notebooks still miss
  eight liquidity scenarios and require tighter replay validation before the
  next deployment window.

### Remediation Actions

- Backfill the missing market depth manifests for **DynamicTradingAlgo** and run
  a supervised replay to keep accuracy trending toward 88%+.
- Publish the decision-logic patch notes, including the governance checklists,
  so **DynamicTradingLogic** can maintain its new telemetry cadence.
- Schedule cross-team reviews of the multi-LLM routing policies to ensure
  **DynamicMultiLLM** continues sharing best practices with the trading stack.

### Follow-up Windows

- Confirm automation manifest completion by **2025-10-20** ahead of the next
  exchange simulation drill.
- Re-run the trading stack benchmark with the refreshed manifests on
  **2025-11-03** to validate sustained B-band performance across the trading
  logic and algo domains.
