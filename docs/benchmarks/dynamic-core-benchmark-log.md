# Dynamic Core Model Benchmark Log

## 2025-10-05 — Foundation Through Integration Health Check

### Snapshot Summary

- **Core1DataProcessing** sustained an A band with 96% coverage and sub-6h
  telemetry freshness, anchoring ingestion quality for the rest of the mesh.
- **Core2PatternRecognition** and **Core3PredictiveModeling** both landed in the
  B range; pattern variance reviews are queued to close the remaining accuracy
  delta.
- Governance staleness is now under 16 hours for all validation and integration
  cores, removing the previous replay audit backlog.

### Remediation Actions

- **Core6AdaptiveLearning** and **Core7DecisionLogic** climbed into the B range
  after the tuning cycles. Backfill the missing adaptive feedback datasets so
  the improvement persists without manual intervention.
- **Core8MemoryManagement** needs an updated retention manifest; align the
  Supabase archive to restore ≥88% coverage before the next cycle.
- Maintain fast-follow checks on **Core4RiskAssessment** to ensure the new risk
  scenario library stabilises telemetry at <12 hours.

### Follow-up Windows

- Schedule adaptive learning retrospectives for **2025-10-19** to confirm
  remediation velocity across the C-band cores.
- Confirm integration validation replay (cores 10–11) during the **2025-10-26**
  governance sync to guarantee cross-core readiness before production drills.
