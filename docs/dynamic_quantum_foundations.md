# Dynamic Quantum Foundations

## Purpose

This document formalises the quantum-inspired vocabulary used across the Dynamic
Capital ecosystem so hybrid research, engineering, and governance teams share a
common mathematical mental model. It reframes the "dynamic" subsystems (e.g.
`dynamic_state`, `dynamic_metacognition`, `dynamic_sync`) using the notation of
quantum mechanics without claiming any new physical law. The goal is to create a
coherent blueprint for probabilistic reasoning, decision orchestration, and
agent coordination that can be simulated on classical or quantum hardware.

## Conceptual Mapping

| Quantum Concept         | Dynamic Analogue                           | Description                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wave function \(\psi\)  | `dynamic_state`                            | Encapsulates the joint configuration of markets, agents, and telemetry in a single probability amplitude vector.    |
| Superposition           | `dynamic_metacognition`, `dynamic_mindset` | Represents concurrent hypotheses or strategic branches that coexist until evaluated.                                |
| Collapse of \(\psi\)    | `dynamic_evaluation`, `dynamic_orderflow`  | Selects an executable path that converts amplitudes into a concrete action.                                         |
| Entanglement            | `dynamic_sync`, `dynamic_agents`           | Captures coupled agents or instruments whose state transitions are correlated beyond classical communication.       |
| Hamiltonian \(\hat{H}\) | `dynamic_energy`, `dynamic_chaos_engine`   | Governs temporal evolution by aggregating market energy, agent drives, and chaotic feedback into a single operator. |
| Qubit                   | `dynamic_logic`                            | Fundamental information carrier that stores binary and superposed cognitive primitives.                             |

## Core Equations

### 1. System Evolution (Schrödinger Analogue)

\[ i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \lvert \Psi(t) \rangle =
\hat{H}_\text{dyn} \lvert \Psi(t) \rangle \]

- **State vector \(\lvert \Psi(t) \rangle\)**: The dynamic state vector combines
  agent intent, market structure, and external signals into a unified Hilbert
  space.
- **Dynamic Hamiltonian \(\hat{H}_\text{dyn}\)**: Decompose into operators for
  market data (`\hat{H}_\text{market}`), agent strategy fields
  (`\hat{H}_\text{agent}`), chaotic influence loops (`\hat{H}_\text{chaos}`),
  and synchronisation potentials (`\hat{H}_\text{sync}`).
- **Interpretation**: Solving the equation yields forward-propagated probability
  amplitudes for each scenario tracked by the dynamic intelligence layer.

### 2. Decision Projection (Measurement Analogue)

\[ P(a) = \lvert \langle a \vert \Psi \rangle \rvert^2 \]

- **Action eigenstates \(\lvert a \rangle\)**: Canonical decisions such as
  `|BUY⟩`, `|SELL⟩`, governance votes, or risk mitigation tasks.
- **Projection**: Inner product computes the overlap between the live dynamic
  state and a target action, producing execution probabilities.
- **Usage**: Calibrate action thresholds so the `dynamic_orderflow` layer
  triggers execution only when probability mass exceeds governance-defined
  confidence.

### 3. Agent Entanglement (Correlation Analogue)

\[ \lvert \Psi_{AB} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big( \lvert \text{Bullish}_A
\rangle \otimes \lvert \text{Bullish}_B \rangle + \lvert \text{Bearish}_A
\rangle \otimes \lvert \text{Bearish}_B \rangle \big) \]

- **Interpretation**: Agents A and B remain synchronised; resolving one agent’s
  stance instantaneously fixes the other’s. Useful for modelling `dynamic_sync`
  clusters or covenanted liquidity pools.
- **Extension**: Generalise to multipartite states when coordinating strategy
  guilds, liquidity swarms, or compliance watchers.

## Implementation Pathway

1. **State Space Definition**
   - Enumerate observable variables (prices, volatility, belief scores,
     governance posture) and encode them as basis vectors.
   - Use tensor products to construct composite spaces representing coupled
     agent-environment states.
2. **Operator Engineering**
   - Parameterise `\hat{H}_\text{dyn}` using classical analytics (risk models,
     causal graphs) to produce Hermitian operators.
   - Attach tunable parameters sourced from `dynamic_predictive`
     machine-learning models.
3. **Simulation Stack**
   - Prototype with quantum SDKs such as Google Cirq, IBM Qiskit, or Rigetti
     Forest to build circuits mirroring the formalism.
   - Provide classical emulation paths for reproducibility and to benchmark
     quantum heuristics against deterministic baselines.
4. **Hybrid Integration**
   - Feed projection outcomes into classical controllers responsible for
     execution, compliance, and telemetry.
   - Store amplitude snapshots and measurement logs in the governance ledger for
     auditability and retrospective analysis.

## Governance and Assurance Considerations

- **Audit Trails**: Every simulated evolution or measurement should emit circuit
  metadata, fidelity scores, and classical comparison metrics.
- **Risk Controls**: Define collapse thresholds, entanglement policies, and
  fallback logic before live deployment to maintain regulatory compliance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Track resonance indicators such as stability indices,
  decision latency, and divergence between quantum-inspired forecasts and
  realised market outcomes.

## Next Steps

- Build a reference implementation that wires the
  `dynamic_quantum.engine.DynamicQuantumEngine` data structures into the state
  vector formalism described here.
- Develop training curricula so research teams can translate domain heuristics
  into operator components of `\hat{H}_\text{dyn}`.
- Establish a validation suite that stress-tests superposition planning,
  entanglement coordination, and collapse thresholds using historical market
  scenarios.
