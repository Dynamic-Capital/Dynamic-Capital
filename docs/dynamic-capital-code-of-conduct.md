# Dynamic Capital Code of Conduct

The Dynamic Capital community thrives when every contributor, partner, and
customer feels safe, respected, and empowered to share ideas. This Code of
Conduct sets shared expectations for how we collaborate across repositories,
chat channels, trading desks, and live events. By participating in any Dynamic
Capital program you agree to uphold these standards and to support others in
doing the same.

## Scope

This policy applies to all Dynamic Capital spaces, including but not limited to:

- Git repositories, pull requests, and issue trackers within the Dynamic Capital
  organization.
- Real-time conversations across Telegram, Discord, Slack, and voice or video
  calls.
- Internal documentation, dashboards, analytics surfaces, and operations
  consoles.
- In-person meetings, hackathons, conferences, or field work conducted under
  Dynamic Capital branding.
- Third-party venues (e.g., partner communities, service desks) when
  representing Dynamic Capital or using company resources.

## Core Principles

We anchor our collaboration on the following values:

1. **Integrity** – Act honestly, document decisions transparently, and disclose
   conflicts of interest.
2. **Respect** – Value people and ideas, especially across cultures, time zones,
   and seniority levels.
3. **Accountability** – Own your commitments, deliver on timelines, and
   communicate risks early.
4. **Security First** – Protect sensitive data, follow the documented security
   checklists, and raise incidents immediately.
5. **Continuous Learning** – Share knowledge, mentor teammates, and remain open
   to feedback.

## Expected Behavior

All participants are expected to:

- Follow published runbooks, checklists, and guardrails that secure customer
  trust.
- Use inclusive language and ensure communication is clear, constructive, and
  professional.
- Default to transparency: document decisions, cite data sources, and capture
  system changes in the appropriate logs.
- Respect boundaries around working hours, response times, and escalation paths.
- Seek consent before recording meetings, screen sharing, or posting private
  information.
- Support teammates who raise questions or concerns, and offer mentorship when
  gaps are identified.
- Credit the contributions of others and ask for permission before reusing
  proprietary assets.
- Practice good digital hygiene: lock devices, rotate credentials per policy,
  and report phishing or suspicious behavior.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Dynamic Capital has zero tolerance for:

- Harassment, intimidation, discrimination, or disrespectful conduct targeting
  individuals or groups.
- Sharing confidential, regulated, or customer-identifiable data outside
  authorized channels.
- Manipulating markets, falsifying results, or misrepresenting trading
  performance.
- Bypassing security controls, ignoring access boundaries, or exploiting
  vulnerabilities without proper disclosure.
- Retaliation against anyone who reports misconduct, vulnerabilities, or policy
  violations in good faith.
- Insubordination, sabotage, or deliberate disruption of services, tools, or
  operations.

## Reporting an Issue

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. Document what happened (dates, participants, screenshots, logs) while
   respecting confidentiality.
2. Notify the Code of Conduct committee via the private security channel or the
   `security@dynamiccapital.ai` mailbox.
3. For urgent safety issues, escalate immediately through the on-call escalation
   tree or call emergency services as appropriate.
4. If the incident involves a committee member, contact the designated
   ombudsperson listed in the security escalation matrix.

Reports are reviewed within one business day. You will receive confirmation of
receipt, a summary of next steps, and a follow-up timeline. All reports are
handled discreetly; details are shared only with those who need to know.

## Investigation & Enforcement

The Code of Conduct committee, in partnership with legal and security leads, may
take any of the following actions based on the severity and context of a
violation:

- Coaching or facilitated conversations to restore trust and clarify
  expectations.
- Written warnings and remediation plans with clear deadlines.
- Temporary or permanent revocation of repository, infrastructure, or
  communication access.
- Suspension or termination of employment, contracts, or contributor agreements.
- Escalation to law enforcement or regulators when required by law or
  contractual obligations.

All actions are documented for audit purposes. Appeals can be submitted to the
ombudsperson within 10 business days of receiving an enforcement decision.

## Protection from Retaliation

Dynamic Capital prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports an issue,
participates in an investigation, or provides witness testimony. Retaliatory
actions—including demotions, assignment changes, exclusion from meetings, or
negative performance reviews—will be treated as independent violations with
separate disciplinary consequences.

## Continuous Improvement

The Code of Conduct is reviewed quarterly or after any major incident. Feedback
is welcome via the documentation issue tracker or direct outreach to the
committee. Updates are communicated through release notes, internal broadcasts,
and the documentation changelog.

## Acknowledgment

Participation in Dynamic Capital projects, programs, and events constitutes
acknowledgment of this Code of Conduct. Team leads are responsible for ensuring
new contributors read and agree to the policy during onboarding, and for
refreshing awareness during recurring security and compliance training.
