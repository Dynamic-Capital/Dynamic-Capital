# Project Scan Overview

## Step-by-step reconnaissance

1. **Inventory top-level domains** – Enumerated primary directories at the
   repository root to understand the breadth of applications, backend services,
   and automation utilities before diving deeper.
2. **Inspect client experiences** – Opened the `apps/` workspace to verify that
   `landing` and `web` house the marketing site and the Next.js-powered Telegram
   Mini App/dashboard bundle respectively.
3. **Review algorithmic engines** – Surveyed Python packages under
   `algorithms/`, `core/`, `dynamic.intelligence.ai_apps/`, `dynamic.trading.algo/`, and `dynamic.platform.token/`
   to map where trading, treasury, and AI orchestration logic live.
4. **Trace integrations and queues** – Checked `integrations/` and `queue/` to
   identify connectors for MT5, Telegram, TradingView, and the lightweight job
   runner dispatching asynchronous workloads.
5. **Map infrastructure tooling** – Explored `scripts/`, `supabase/`, and
   `tools/` to catalogue deployment flows, edge functions, and resource
   definitions supporting automation and infrastructure-as-code.

## Directory highlights

- `apps/`
  - `landing`: Lightweight marketing site package for the public-facing
    experience.
  - `web`: Comprehensive Next.js App Router workspace powering the Telegram Mini
    App and admin console with shared components, hooks, and services.
- `algorithms/`: Contains algorithm artifacts across Python, Pine Script, MQL5,
  and webhook adapters for strategy experimentation and external integrations.
- `core/`: Python trading core with fusion engines, market-making routines, and
  shared Supabase client utilities.
- `dynamic.intelligence.ai_apps/`: AI orchestration layer coordinating agent behaviors, risk
  modules, hedging, and training pipelines.
- `dynamic.trading.algo/`: Modular automation suite describing roles (CEO/CFO/COO),
  marketing, analytics, and middleware primitives for Dynamic Capital workflows.
- `dynamic.platform.token/`: Treasury utilities managing Dynamic Capital Token accounting
  logic.
- `integrations/`: Connectors bridging MT5, Telegram bots, TradingView feeds,
  and Supabase logging helpers.
- `queue/`: Custom TypeScript job queue with processors such as `dct-events` to
  deliver webhook payloads reliably.
- `scripts/`: Extensive deployment, auditing, and operational scripts for
  Supabase, Telegram webhooks, Mini App builds, and environment validation.
- `supabase/`: Edge functions, migrations, and resource schematics driving the
  Supabase backend, including automation cron jobs and webhook handlers.
- `docs/`: Knowledge base covering architecture overviews, compliance,
  whitepapers, and contributor guides.
- `data/`: Datasets and machine learning artifact placeholders that support
  analytics and AI-driven features across the platform.
- `dynamic/models/`: Model checkpoints and assets referenced by AI-assisted tooling and
  analytics flows.
- `tools/`: Developer utilities, including automation helpers and shared
  workflows for repository maintenance.
