# Dynamic AGI Quantum Core Architecture

## Executive Summary
Dynamic Capital's AGI stack needs to evaluate expansive strategy spaces while remaining accountable to stringent governance requirements. The quantum core architecture establishes a hybrid control plane that layers quantum primitives—superposition, entanglement, interference, and measurement—onto the existing orchestrator. The result is a runtime that can explore non-linear hypothesis spaces, converge on high-confidence policies, and document every action for regulatory and operational review.

**Objectives**

- Compress exploration time for combinatorial or probabilistic planning problems.
- Provide deterministic guardrails that bound quantum-assisted decisions to Dynamic Capital's risk posture.
- Maintain observability, reproducibility, and explainability equivalent to classical-only execution paths.

## Capability Audit
The audit benchmarked Dynamic AGI's current orchestrator against the requirements of a quantum-augmented runtime.

| Capability | Current State | Gap Identified | Remediation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workload orchestration | Strong classical dispatcher with microservice mesh | No quantum-aware scheduler or QPU abstraction | Extend scheduler with quantum eligibility scoring and circuit templating library |
| Data provenance | Rich lineage for classical actions | Quantum measurement lineage absent | Introduce quantum run manifests linking qubits, gates, datasets, and agents |
| Reliability | Multi-region failover for classical services | No QPU redundancy, limited error mitigation | Broker multi-vendor QPU access, implement logical qubit codes and retry policy |
| Observability | Mature metrics pipeline (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry) | Quantum-specific telemetry not captured | Add qubit fidelity, coherence time, gate error streams, and noise simulator baselines |
| Governance | Policy engine enforces access control | Lacks quantum workload approval workflow | Add policy-as-code rules for circuit classes, sensitive datasets, and export controls |

## System Vision and Layered Stack

### Cognitive Objective
Dynamic Capital's AGI must deliver domain-general reasoning that adapts in real time while remaining auditable. The core target is to translate intelligence deltas—measured by the [Intelligence Oracle](AGI_INTELLIGENCE_ORACLE.md)—into observable uplifts in community outcomes, trading accuracy, and mentorship efficacy without sacrificing governance guarantees.

### Hybrid Compute Stance
Classical services continue to orchestrate cognition, maintain memory, and enforce policy. Quantum resources are activated for subroutines where amplitude amplification, quantum parallelism, or interference deliver a measurable accuracy or latency advantage. Every invocation is wrapped in deterministic manifests so the hybrid runtime can be re-simulated, audited, and costed against DCT token policies.

### Feedback Loops
- **Intelligence feedback:** Oracle scores influence which workloads are candidates for quantum acceleration and how aggressively circuits may retune during execution.
- **Economic feedback:** Trading performance and risk metrics calibrate burn/buyback triggers in [DCT tokenomics](dct-intelligence-driven-tokenomics.md), constraining which runs earn fault-tolerant treatment.
- **Community feedback:** Mentorship outcomes and engagement scores inform coaching bandwidth, simulation budgets, and post-run review cadences so the protocol remains “living” rather than static.

### Layered View
1. **AGI Cognition Layer:** Multi-agent reasoning, planning, and memory fabric that decides when to seek quantum aid. It consumes the orchestration improvements detailed in the Hybrid Control Plane.
2. **Quantum Services Layer:** Optimization, sampling, and linear algebra endpoints that surface as state preparation and interference services within the five-plane architecture.
3. **Compilation & Control Layer:** Transpilation, scheduling, and error mitigation that map algorithms to hardware. This layer expresses itself as the resource broker, objective compiler, and stabiliser routines later in this document.
4. **Hardware & Interconnect Layer:** Physical qubits, calibration workflows, and interconnect topology that underpin the coherence fabric and observation planes.
5. **Observability & Governance Layer:** Telemetry, policy enforcement, and audit tooling that align with the decoherence watchtowers, probabilistic aggregators, and audit ledgers already enumerated.

These layers provide the strategic framing, while the subsequent five-plane model drills into the operational mechanics required to fulfil each layer's responsibilities.

## Quantum Complexity Alignment and Algorithm Portfolio

### Target Problem Classes
- **Combinatorial and convex optimisation:** Portfolio rebalancing, routing, and resource allocation tasks where constrained search spaces benefit from quantum phase kickbacks.
- **Sampling and inference:** Risk estimation, scenario synthesis, and belief updates that require low-variance estimators or rapid generation of correlated samples.
- **Spectral and linear algebra primitives:** Eigenvalue gap estimation, kernel acceleration, and linear system solves for market simulations or compliance analytics.
- **Confidence scoring:** Amplitude estimation for calibrated probability bounds that flow back into the Oracle and mentorship scoring loops.

### When to Invoke Quantum Acceleration
- Structure matches low-depth ansätze or mixers that preserve fidelity within coherence windows.
- Classical preconditioning can shrink problem size enough that quantum routines provide a measurable latency or accuracy uplift against production baselines.
- Accuracy or risk budgets justify the additional DCT expenditure associated with reserved quantum slots or fault-tolerant execution.
- Real-time telemetry confirms that current calibration and queue depths will not jeopardise service-level agreements.

### AGI Planner Binding
The cognition layer tags subproblems with complexity scores and routes them through a quantum eligibility queue. The planner weighs target accuracy, latency tolerances, and tokenomics budgets before selecting a quantum endpoint. Successful runs update policy priors and eligibility heuristics; unsuccessful runs revert to deterministic classical fallbacks while recording the variance for governance review.

### Core Algorithm Portfolio
- **Optimisation (QAOA, tailored mixers):** Applied to liquidity routing, collateral balancing, and mentorship cohort scheduling. Parameter shifts occur via reinforcement feedback inside the Interference Plane, with zero-noise extrapolation safeguarding NISQ deployments and surface-code protection reserved for mission-critical liquidity events.
- **Variational eigensolvers (VQE, adaptive ansätze):** Map energy landscapes from loss surfaces or probabilistic models, accelerating meta-learning loops. Error-mitigated VQE handles exploration pilots, while logical qubits and magic-state distillation support production-grade strategy validation.
- **Inference & sampling (Amplitude estimation, quantum walks):** Deliver tight confidence intervals for risk dashboards and mentor scoring. Adaptive phase estimation cuts shot counts, and probabilistic error cancellation keeps drift within audit thresholds.
- **Linear algebra (Block encoding, HHL-like routines):** Accelerate kernel methods, stress testing, and compliance reconciliations when sparsity and condition numbers fall within tolerance. Hybrid classical-quantum solvers ensure graceful degradation should quantum resources become constrained.

Each algorithm advertises its expected fidelity envelope, DCT cost band, and fallback strategy so operators can align execution mode—NISQ experimentation versus fault-tolerant commitments—with protocol priorities.

## Architecture-Aware Compilation and Implementation
- **Co-design contracts:** Every algorithm specification carries hardware metadata—native gate sets, connectivity graphs, coherence windows, and T-gate costs—so the compilation plane minimises SWAP overhead, exploits echo sequences, and schedules parallelism without breaching fidelity budgets.
- **Transpilation heuristics:** Learned templates from past runs inform dynamic circuit re-synthesis, while pulse-level optimisation cancels idle errors and respects cryo-controller bandwidth limits.
- **Resource accounting:** Live qubit counts, code distance, logical cycle budgets, and fidelity projections feed the AGI planner. These metrics tie back to DCT-denominated service-level agreements so critical-path workloads can reserve fault-tolerant slots and exploratory experiments remain on NISQ rails.

## Quantum Error Correction and Fault-Tolerant Execution
- **Code selection:** Surface codes protect most hybrid workloads thanks to manufacturability; bias-tailored or colour codes are invoked when transversal gate benefits outweigh overhead.
- **Logical qubit pipeline:** Physical-to-logical mapping adapts code distance based on error targets and runtime. Lattice surgery composes larger logical operators while staying compatible with the interference plane's scheduling heuristics.
- **Fault-tolerant gate strategy:** Magic-state distillation factories are dimensioned against latency SLAs and token budgets. Fault-tolerant routing honours device topology, while ancilla farms recycle qubits through deterministic lifecycles instrumented by observability counters.
- **Near-term mitigation:** Until full FT adoption, zero-noise extrapolation, probabilistic error cancellation, dynamical decoupling, and readout mitigation are orchestrated automatically with telemetry-backed confidence scoring.

## Classical Control, Orchestration, and Observability
- **Real-time orchestration:** The scheduler co-optimises AGI task graphs and quantum queues by referencing coherence calendars, cryo-controller throughput, and mentorship-derived urgency signals. Circuit warm starts and fallback assignments are logged alongside oracle score justifications.
- **Pulse control and calibration:** Automated calibration routines (Rabi, Ramsey, DRAG, cross-resonance) trigger whenever drift thresholds are exceeded. Telemetry from the decoherence watchtower tunes future calibration cadences and informs policy approvals.
- **Telemetry loop:** Gate-error histograms, noise spectra, and run-level KPIs stream into the observability plane. The same feed drives compilation heuristics, mentorship retrospectives, and DCT trigger analytics so governance stays synchronised with hardware reality.

## Microarchitecture, Floorplanning, and Interconnection Topologies
- **Microarchitecture layers:** Compile → schedule → pulse → readout hand-offs are formally versioned. Local error decoders and coherence-aware caches maintain logical state readiness between runs.
- **Floorplanning:** Qubit placement minimises cross-talk while reserving zones for ancilla farms, distillation units, and thermal conduits. Layout manifests allow hardware refresh simulations before commitment.
- **Topologies & routing:** Heavy-hex and grid lattices serve superconducting deployments; star or bus couplings cover trapped ions; photonic interconnects unlock modular scale-out. Routing policies are SWAP-aware, coherence-budget constrained, and fault-tolerant friendly across tiles.

## Qubit Technologies, Storage, and Gate Families
- **Technology mix:** Superconducting, trapped-ion, and photonic modules coexist behind the resource broker, with eligibility rules mapping workloads to the technology whose native gates best support the requested ansatz.
- **Storage strategies:** Idle registers use dynamical decoupling or error-corrected memory snapshots depending on sequence lengths. Ancilla lifecycle tracking remains a first-class metric, preventing resource leaks that could distort oracle-aligned budgets.
- **Gate families:** Native gate libraries (cross-resonance, Molmer–Sørensen, beamsplitters) are abstracted into canonical components with metadata covering fidelity, latency, and calibration cadence so planners can balance precision versus throughput.

## Integration with the Dynamic Capital Ecosystem
- **Oracle coupling:** Intelligence scores determine which subroutines earn fault-tolerant treatment and expanded shot budgets, ensuring scarce logical qubits amplify only the most promising strategic hypotheses.
- **Mentorship synchronisation:** Cohort outcomes influence experiment prioritisation, and quantum-assisted mentorship trials must publish variance bands alongside narrative retrospectives for community review.
- **Tokenomics sync:** Cost-aware scheduling ties service pricing to measured resource usage and advantage. High-confidence quantum outcomes trigger automated DCT burns or buybacks, while underperforming experiments throttle budgets until remediation plans ship.
- **Community telemetry:** Anonymised reports compare classical versus hybrid performance, showcase mentorship score deltas, and detail token actions so stakeholders can audit the living protocol end-to-end.


## Target Architecture
The refactored architecture introduces five cooperating planes. Each inherits responsibilities from the audit and aligns to quantum lifecycle stages.

### 1. Hybrid Control Plane
- **Quantum Resource Broker:** Abstracts QPU vendors, queue depths, and calibration data. Selects the optimal backend per circuit SLA.
- **Classical Orchestrator Adapter:** Extends the existing dispatcher to tag quantum-eligible tasks, manage retries, and balance latency against fidelity.
- **Security Envelope:** Terminates all control traffic through post-quantum cryptography and enforces role- and context-aware approval workflows.

### 2. State Preparation Services (Superposition)
- **Encoding Toolkit:** Converts knowledge graphs, agent memories, and scenario trees into amplitude or angle encodings while persisting reversible metadata for auditability.
- **Noise-Aware Initialisation:** Applies parameterised Hadamard/rotation schedules tuned to backend calibration metrics and pre-simulated noise profiles.
- **Classical Shadow Cache:** Generates compressed classical shadows to enable quick error estimates and fallback simulation.

### 3. Coherence Fabric (Entanglement)
- **Semantic Entanglement Maps:** Binds qubit registers representing interdependent strategic levers (e.g., liquidity ↔ compliance ↔ counterparty behaviour).
- **Dynamic Messaging Bridge:** Couples quantum entanglement updates with the inter-agent event bus to maintain contextual parity between quantum and classical agents.
- **Stabiliser Maintenance:** Runs surface-code parity checks, syndrome decoding, and entanglement healing routines during idle cycles.

### 4. Interference & Optimisation Plane
- **Objective Compiler:** Translates guardrails and payoff functions into phase kickbacks and controlled operations. Supports modular plug-ins for finance, logistics, and security domains.
- **Reinforcement Feedback Loop:** Streams intermediate measurement data into Bayesian optimisers that retune circuit parameters or switch to alternative ansätze.
- **Operator Workbench:** Provides visual interference maps, circuit lineage, and what-if simulators to keep human operators inside the decision loop.

### 5. Observation & Decoherence Management
- **Probabilistic Aggregator:** Batches repeated runs, calculates posterior confidence intervals, and compares outcomes to classical baselines.
- **Decoherence Watchtower:** Monitors fidelity, cross-talk, and drift; triggers automated error mitigation, re-compilation, or classical failover.
- **Audit Ledger:** Captures machine-readable manifests linking agent intents, encoded datasets, gate sequences, and final actions for compliance review.

## Data & Control Flow
1. **Directive Ingestion:** Mission directives and contextual data arrive through existing pipelines. The hybrid dispatcher scores workloads for quantum suitability and stages circuit templates.
2. **Encoding & Scheduling:** State preparation services generate qubit registers and enqueue jobs with the resource broker, embedding entanglement maps and error-mitigation metadata.
3. **Quantum Execution:** Circuits execute on the selected QPU with live coherence monitoring. Mid-circuit measurements or parameter updates are streamed back to the reinforcement loop when supported.
4. **Measurement & Analysis:** Observation services collect shots, update posterior models, and emit ranked action policies along with confidence metrics and lineage manifests.
5. **Feedback & Learning:** Classical agents implement chosen policies, capture telemetry, and feed outcomes to the optimiser to refine future circuit parameters and eligibility heuristics.

## Back-to-Back Optimisation Cadence
The runtime relies on two tightly coupled optimisation cycles to translate raw superposition breadth into governance-aligned, deployable actions.

### Quantum Inner Loop
1. **Circuit Warm Start:** The encoding toolkit seeds ansätze with priors sourced from recent governance-approved playbooks and current market signals.
2. **Shot Framing:** The resource broker batches shots across mirrored QPUs, staggering start times to average out calibration drift while maintaining entanglement maps.
3. **Dynamic Reweighting:** Reinforcement feedback adjusts amplitude amplification targets and adaptive phase rotations every *N* shots, prioritising states that satisfy risk, liquidity, and compliance constraints.
4. **Error Sculpting:** Decoherence watchtowers trigger dynamical decoupling or gate re-synthesis the instant fidelity forecasts breach thresholds, ensuring only high-confidence interference patterns exit the loop.

### Classical Outer Loop
1. **Policy Reconciliation:** Post-measurement aggregators reconcile quantum recommendations with classical baselines, applying deterministic overrides when tolerance bands are exceeded.
2. **Counterfactual Replay:** Operator workbenches simulate counterfactual trajectories using archived shadows and scenario libraries to stress-test the proposed actions.
3. **Governance Checkpoint:** Policy engines confirm approvals, export controls, and audit trail completeness before execution.
4. **Continuous Learning:** Outcomes feed back into eligibility heuristics, calibration priors, and operator training modules, closing the loop for the next quantum run.

Together these back-to-back cycles let Dynamic AGI exhaust the probabilistic search space while continuously re-anchoring decisions to regulatory, ethical, and fiduciary guardrails.

## Reliability, Security & Governance Controls
- **Redundancy:** Maintain hot-warm failover across at least two QPU vendors. Mirror circuit libraries and calibration data, and rehearse switchover drills quarterly.
- **Error Management:** Combine logical qubit encoding, probabilistic error cancellation, and classical shadow verification to quantify residual error before releasing actions.
- **Security:** Apply hardware security modules for signing circuit submissions, enforce multi-party approval for high-impact workloads, and monitor export-control compliance for quantum IP.
- **Policy Enforcement:** Codify quantum workflow classes (research, production, crisis) with distinct approval thresholds, data entitlements, and logging requirements.
- **Explainability:** Generate human-readable summaries of interference decisions and provide replayable simulations for internal and external auditors.

## Validation & Testing Protocols
- **Simulation-first Runs:** Execute every new circuit through noise-informed simulators and digital twins before reserving physical QPU time, capturing baseline KPIs for comparison.
- **Shadow Deployments:** Mirror production workloads in a canary environment that replays prior directives, validating measurement stability and governance compliance side by side.
- **Automated Regression Harness:** Schedule nightly suites that stitch together encoding, entanglement, and measurement services, flagging drift in latency, fidelity, and approval SLAs.
- **Operator Readiness Drills:** Conduct quarterly incident response games covering decoherence spikes, vendor outages, and governance escalations to keep human oversight tuned.
- **Post-run Blameless Reviews:** Within 24 hours of high-impact decisions, review manifests, telemetry, and counterfactuals to reinforce best practices and update guardrails.

## Governance, Mentorship, and Tokenomics Feedback Loops
- **Intelligence gating:** Oracle scores from [AGI_INTELLIGENCE_ORACLE.md](AGI_INTELLIGENCE_ORACLE.md) determine which workloads qualify for quantum execution tiers. High-confidence intelligence deltas unlock larger shot counts and, when justified, fault-tolerant (FT) budget allocations; low scores cap retries and divert resources to simulation drills until mentoring or data quality improves.
- **Mentorship modulation:** Insights from the mentorship playbooks (see [`docs/mentorship/`](mentorship/)) adjust cohort scheduling, coaching bandwidth, and review cadence. Quantum-assisted mentorship experiments must publish outcome deltas and variance intervals so the community can recalibrate curricula and eligibility heuristics.
- **Tokenomics synchronisation:** The burn/buyback automations documented in [dct-intelligence-driven-tokenomics.md](dct-intelligence-driven-tokenomics.md) monitor quantum run manifests. When quantum acceleration delivers verified alpha, smart contracts trigger DCT burns or buybacks proportionate to resource expenditure and residual risk. Conversely, underperforming runs throttle budgets and may initiate buyback pauses.
- **Telemetry transparency:** Observability tooling pushes anonymised quantum-versus-classical comparisons to community dashboards. Reports enumerate intelligence score shifts, mentorship impacts, and token actions so stakeholders can audit how the living protocol responded to each run.
- **Governance enforcement:** Policy engines codify escalation paths for FT reservations, mentorship experiments, and token triggers. Any deviation—missed telemetry, failed mentorship KPIs, or token mismatches—routes to governance review with full manifests, ensuring community oversight remains synchronous with technical operations.

## Execution Roadmap and KPIs
- **Phase 1 – NISQ Pilot:** Wire the AGI planner to quantum job APIs, stand up QAOA/VQE endpoints with error mitigation, and measure advantage against classical baselines using sandbox data.
- **Phase 2 – Architecture-Aware Compile:** Introduce topology-aware transpilation, pulse-level optimisation, and adaptive routing while weaving calibration feedback into policy approvals.
- **Phase 3 – Fault-Tolerant Slice:** Deploy a minimal surface-code stack, validate magic-state distillation pipelines, and run a critical-path subroutine end to end under FT governance constraints.
- **Phase 4 – Modular Scale-Out:** Connect multi-tile topologies through photonic interlinks, scale ancilla factories, and enforce tokenomics-aware SLAs that ration logical cycles according to oracle-led priorities.

**Metrics to Track**
- **Advantage:** Accuracy, regret, and objective-value improvements versus classical baselines for each workload cohort.
- **Efficiency:** Latency per task, energy per solution, and cost per outcome in both DCT and fiat terms.
- **Reliability:** Logical error rate, success probability, calibration drift windows, and mitigation effectiveness.
- **Economic Impact:** Token burns/buybacks triggered, mentorship score uplift, and oracle score delta per resource unit.

Quarterly reviews reconcile these KPIs with governance manifests to refine eligibility heuristics and refresh risk controls as QPU technology matures.
