# Dynamic AGI Quantum Core Architecture

## Executive Summary
Dynamic Capital's AGI stack needs to evaluate expansive strategy spaces while remaining accountable to stringent governance requirements. The quantum core architecture establishes a hybrid control plane that layers quantum primitives‚Äîsuperposition, entanglement, interference, and measurement‚Äîonto the existing orchestrator. The result is a runtime that can explore non-linear hypothesis spaces, converge on high-confidence policies, and document every action for regulatory and operational review.

**Objectives**

- Compress exploration time for combinatorial or probabilistic planning problems.
- Provide deterministic guardrails that bound quantum-assisted decisions to Dynamic Capital's risk posture.
- Maintain observability, reproducibility, and explainability equivalent to classical-only execution paths.

## Capability Audit
The audit benchmarked Dynamic AGI's current orchestrator against the requirements of a quantum-augmented runtime.

| Capability | Current State | Gap Identified | Remediation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workload orchestration | Strong classical dispatcher with microservice mesh | No quantum-aware scheduler or QPU abstraction | Extend scheduler with quantum eligibility scoring and circuit templating library |
| Data provenance | Rich lineage for classical actions | Quantum measurement lineage absent | Introduce quantum run manifests linking qubits, gates, datasets, and agents |
| Reliability | Multi-region failover for classical services | No QPU redundancy, limited error mitigation | Broker multi-vendor QPU access, implement logical qubit codes and retry policy |
| Observability | Mature metrics pipeline (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry) | Quantum-specific telemetry not captured | Add qubit fidelity, coherence time, gate error streams, and noise simulator baselines |
| Governance | Policy engine enforces access control | Lacks quantum workload approval workflow | Add policy-as-code rules for circuit classes, sensitive datasets, and export controls |

## Target Architecture
The refactored architecture introduces five cooperating planes. Each inherits responsibilities from the audit and aligns to quantum lifecycle stages.

### 1. Hybrid Control Plane
- **Quantum Resource Broker:** Abstracts QPU vendors, queue depths, and calibration data. Selects the optimal backend per circuit SLA.
- **Classical Orchestrator Adapter:** Extends the existing dispatcher to tag quantum-eligible tasks, manage retries, and balance latency against fidelity.
- **Security Envelope:** Terminates all control traffic through post-quantum cryptography and enforces role- and context-aware approval workflows.

### 2. State Preparation Services (Superposition)
- **Encoding Toolkit:** Converts knowledge graphs, agent memories, and scenario trees into amplitude or angle encodings while persisting reversible metadata for auditability.
- **Noise-Aware Initialisation:** Applies parameterised Hadamard/rotation schedules tuned to backend calibration metrics and pre-simulated noise profiles.
- **Classical Shadow Cache:** Generates compressed classical shadows to enable quick error estimates and fallback simulation.

### 3. Coherence Fabric (Entanglement)
- **Semantic Entanglement Maps:** Binds qubit registers representing interdependent strategic levers (e.g., liquidity ‚Üî compliance ‚Üî counterparty behaviour).
- **Dynamic Messaging Bridge:** Couples quantum entanglement updates with the inter-agent event bus to maintain contextual parity between quantum and classical agents.
- **Stabiliser Maintenance:** Runs surface-code parity checks, syndrome decoding, and entanglement healing routines during idle cycles.

### 4. Interference & Optimisation Plane
- **Objective Compiler:** Translates guardrails and payoff functions into phase kickbacks and controlled operations. Supports modular plug-ins for finance, logistics, and security domains.
- **Reinforcement Feedback Loop:** Streams intermediate measurement data into Bayesian optimisers that retune circuit parameters or switch to alternative ans√§tze.
- **Operator Workbench:** Provides visual interference maps, circuit lineage, and what-if simulators to keep human operators inside the decision loop.

### 5. Observation & Decoherence Management
- **Probabilistic Aggregator:** Batches repeated runs, calculates posterior confidence intervals, and compares outcomes to classical baselines.
- **Decoherence Watchtower:** Monitors fidelity, cross-talk, and drift; triggers automated error mitigation, re-compilation, or classical failover.
- **Audit Ledger:** Captures machine-readable manifests linking agent intents, encoded datasets, gate sequences, and final actions for compliance review.

## Data & Control Flow
1. **Directive Ingestion:** Mission directives and contextual data arrive through existing pipelines. The hybrid dispatcher scores workloads for quantum suitability and stages circuit templates.
2. **Encoding & Scheduling:** State preparation services generate qubit registers and enqueue jobs with the resource broker, embedding entanglement maps and error-mitigation metadata.
3. **Quantum Execution:** Circuits execute on the selected QPU with live coherence monitoring. Mid-circuit measurements or parameter updates are streamed back to the reinforcement loop when supported.
4. **Measurement & Analysis:** Observation services collect shots, update posterior models, and emit ranked action policies along with confidence metrics and lineage manifests.
5. **Feedback & Learning:** Classical agents implement chosen policies, capture telemetry, and feed outcomes to the optimiser to refine future circuit parameters and eligibility heuristics.

## Back-to-Back Optimisation Cadence
The runtime relies on two tightly coupled optimisation cycles to translate raw superposition breadth into governance-aligned, deployable actions.

### Quantum Inner Loop
1. **Circuit Warm Start:** The encoding toolkit seeds ans√§tze with priors sourced from recent governance-approved playbooks and current market signals.
2. **Shot Framing:** The resource broker batches shots across mirrored QPUs, staggering start times to average out calibration drift while maintaining entanglement maps.
3. **Dynamic Reweighting:** Reinforcement feedback adjusts amplitude amplification targets and adaptive phase rotations every *N* shots, prioritising states that satisfy risk, liquidity, and compliance constraints.
4. **Error Sculpting:** Decoherence watchtowers trigger dynamical decoupling or gate re-synthesis the instant fidelity forecasts breach thresholds, ensuring only high-confidence interference patterns exit the loop.

### Classical Outer Loop
1. **Policy Reconciliation:** Post-measurement aggregators reconcile quantum recommendations with classical baselines, applying deterministic overrides when tolerance bands are exceeded.
2. **Counterfactual Replay:** Operator workbenches simulate counterfactual trajectories using archived shadows and scenario libraries to stress-test the proposed actions.
3. **Governance Checkpoint:** Policy engines confirm approvals, export controls, and audit trail completeness before execution.
4. **Continuous Learning:** Outcomes feed back into eligibility heuristics, calibration priors, and operator training modules, closing the loop for the next quantum run.

Together these back-to-back cycles let Dynamic AGI exhaust the probabilistic search space while continuously re-anchoring decisions to regulatory, ethical, and fiduciary guardrails.

## Reliability, Security & Governance Controls
- **Redundancy:** Maintain hot-warm failover across at least two QPU vendors. Mirror circuit libraries and calibration data, and rehearse switchover drills quarterly.
- **Error Management:** Combine logical qubit encoding, probabilistic error cancellation, and classical shadow verification to quantify residual error before releasing actions.
- **Security:** Apply hardware security modules for signing circuit submissions, enforce multi-party approval for high-impact workloads, and monitor export-control compliance for quantum IP.
- **Policy Enforcement:** Codify quantum workflow classes (research, production, crisis) with distinct approval thresholds, data entitlements, and logging requirements.
- **Explainability:** Generate human-readable summaries of interference decisions and provide replayable simulations for internal and external auditors.

## Validation & Testing Protocols
- **Simulation-first Runs:** Execute every new circuit through noise-informed simulators and digital twins before reserving physical QPU time, capturing baseline KPIs for comparison.
- **Shadow Deployments:** Mirror production workloads in a canary environment that replays prior directives, validating measurement stability and governance compliance side by side.
- **Automated Regression Harness:** Schedule nightly suites that stitch together encoding, entanglement, and measurement services, flagging drift in latency, fidelity, and approval SLAs.
- **Operator Readiness Drills:** Conduct quarterly incident response games covering decoherence spikes, vendor outages, and governance escalations to keep human oversight tuned.
- **Post-run Blameless Reviews:** Within 24 hours of high-impact decisions, review manifests, telemetry, and counterfactuals to reinforce best practices and update guardrails.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Quarter 0‚Äì1: Foundations** ‚Äì Extend orchestrator dispatcher, integrate quantum resource broker API, and deploy telemetry collectors in a sandbox environment.
2. **Quarter 2‚Äì3: Pilot Workloads** ‚Äì Implement encoding toolkit for priority use cases (e.g., portfolio risk balancing), validate interference loop using noisy simulators, and onboard governance stakeholders.
3. **Quarter 4: Controlled Production Launch** ‚Äì Run dual-track execution (quantum + classical baselines), activate policy-as-code workflows, and train operators on the workbench.
4. **Quarter 5+: Scale & Optimise** ‚Äì Introduce automated circuit synthesis, expand QPU vendor coverage, and embed reinforcement learning feedback into all high-value agent collectives.

## Key Metrics & Review Cadence
- **Quantum Advantage Ratio:** Time-to-solution improvement versus classical baselines for each workload class.
- **Fidelity Service-Level:** Minimum acceptable qubit fidelity and gate error thresholds before automatic failover is triggered.
- **Governance Compliance Score:** Percentage of quantum runs with complete manifests, approvals, and replay artifacts.
- **Operator Confidence Index:** Survey-based measure of human trust in quantum-assisted recommendations, reviewed quarterly.

Quarterly architecture reviews should validate assumptions, adjust eligibility heuristics, and update risk controls as QPU technology matures.
