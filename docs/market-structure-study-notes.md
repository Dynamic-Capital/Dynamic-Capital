# Market Structure Study Notes

## 1. Why Structure Matters

### Core principles

- Price action is never random; structure exposes the intent behind order flow
  and highlights where opposing liquidity is gathering.
- High-energy swings advertise active participants. Flat or untouched levels
  lack signal until volatility returns.
- Wyckoff's first law and Newton's laws echo the same lesson: trends persist
  until enough counter-order flow forces a change.
- Markets oscillate between balance, imbalance, and new balance. Liquidity depth
  determines how quickly price leaves each state.

### Operating summary

1. Aggressive buyers extend upswings while retracements stay shallow.
2. Dominant sellers stretch downswings and compress bounces.
3. When pressure is balanced, range-bound swings appear random until a new
   imbalance breaks the deadlock.

## 2. Trend Hierarchy

### Tier overview

| Tier                         | Horizon          | What to monitor                                | Execution focus                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary / Long-Term**      | Months–years     | Weekly/monthly HH/HL or LH/LL map              | Anchor core bias and macro risk exposure.  |
| **Secondary (Intermediate)** | Weeks–few months | Counter-moves that rebalance primary liquidity | Expect deeper pullbacks or relief rallies. |
| **Intermediate Flow**        | Several sessions | Swings that reinforce dominant direction       | Translate macro bias into tactical plans.  |
| **Short-Term**               | Days–weeks       | Local HH/HL or LH/LL inside intermediate flow  | Drive swing or position execution.         |
| **Tertiary / Intraday**      | Hours–days       | Micro-structure often fading the active push   | Refine entries without resetting bias.     |

### Behaviour cues

- **Bullish:** Higher lows form relative to prior and subsequent swings across
  the active tiers.
- **Bearish:** Lower highs form relative to prior and subsequent swings across
  the active tiers.
- Treat the daily structure as the default compass—execute with the trend unless
  higher tiers turn neutral.

## 3. Executing with Structure

### Bias and opportunity filter

- Bullish regimes invite retests of prior structure before continuation;
  sell-offs are only valid once structure breaks.
- Bearish regimes revisit previous lows; countertrend buys require
  higher-time-frame neutrality or a confirmed shift.
- Anchor bias in the highest relevant time frames, then drop to execution
  charts.
- Expect sharp reactions at equilibrium, key supports, resistances, and
  liquidity pools. The first countertrend candle after expansion often offers
  optimal entries and stop placement.

### 12-point execution discipline

**Alignment**

1. Anchor weekly and daily bias before drilling down.
2. Stand aside on lower frames until higher tiers agree with the idea.
3. Wait for daily and weekly alignment before scaling risk.

**Trade selection** 4. Let intermediate swings take profits while short-term
swings drive continuation entries. 5. In bullish regimes, buy pullbacks to
higher lows instead of fading strength. 6. In bearish regimes, sell lower highs
instead of buying weakness. 7. Track the Dollar Index and correlated macro
drivers for confluence.

**Risk management** 8. Define the invalidation level that would reverse bias. 9.
Carry validated levels, order blocks, and liquidity notes forward until
structure invalidates them. 10. Document management actions—partials, trailing
stops, hedges—before the session starts.

**Execution hygiene** 11. Allow higher-time-frame structure to coordinate
intraday entries and scaling. 12. Log observations after each session to start
the next review with a clear state.

## 4. Terminology and Quick Diagnostics

### Cheat sheet

- **HH / HL:** Higher High / Higher Low → bullish structure.
- **LL / LH:** Lower Low / Lower High → bearish structure.
- **BOS:** Break of Structure → trend continuation cue.
- **CHoCH:** Change of Character → potential trend shift.
- **STH / STL:** Short-Term High / Low → local swing pivots.
- **ITH / ITL:** Intermediate-Term High / Low → key structure levels.
- **LTH / LTL:** Long-Term High / Low → major higher-time-frame pivots.

### Structural quick reference

| Question                            | Diagnostic                                                       | Action                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Where is price in the hierarchy?    | Compare the current swing map with the tier overview.            | Align bias, position size, and risk with the dominant tier.     |
| Is liquidity building or releasing? | Gauge whether recent pivots triggered decisive reactions.        | Prepare for continuation (imbalance) or rotation (equilibrium). |
| Do time frames agree?               | Confirm weekly/daily bias before stepping into execution charts. | Drop to entries only after higher tiers support the idea.       |
| What invalidates the plan?          | Identify the opposing structure level or missing confirmation.   | Pre-plan management responses to avoid reactive decisions.      |

## 5. Chart-Reading Fundamentals

- Decide your operating timeframe first; indicators and entries follow the
  structural story.
- Use at least three time frames in concert:
  - **Position traders:** Monthly → Weekly → Daily.
  - **Swing traders:** Daily → 4 Hour → 1 Hour.
  - **Intraday traders / scalpers:** 4 Hour → 1 Hour → 15 Minute.
- Workflow: Start with the Monthly view, then step down through Weekly, Daily,
  and finally the intraday charts (H4, M15, M5). Keep the higher structure
  visible while zooming in so context is never lost.

## 6. Keys to Multi-Time-Frame Trading

### Focus

1. Highest timeframe defines directional bias.
2. Intermediate timeframe refines entries aligned with that bias.
3. Lower timeframe handles precision entries and granular management.

### Alignment checks

4. Prioritise high-probability setups near major support and resistance.
5. Confirm highest and intermediate frames agree before committing risk.
6. Advance to lower frames only when the higher two tiers are synced.

### Routine habits

7. Track daily ranges on a rolling five-day basis.
8. Keep daily structure aligned with weekly, monthly, and higher tiers.
9. Understand broader price context before reacting to intraday moves.
10. Review how price cycled through previous ranges and the prior week's
    extremes.
11. Anchor expectations with weekly Fibonacci levels and key range transitions.

## 7. Time-Frame Playbooks

### Shared intraday habits

- Sync lower-time-frame scenarios with weekly/daily bias before sketching new
  plans.
- Carry validated levels and order blocks forward until structure removes them.
- Track weekly/monthly opens, prior highs/lows, and the Asian range for
  recurring liquidity events.
- Journal each session's key observations to reinforce feedback loops.

### Daily timeframe

- **Objective:** Set directional bias and sketch the structural landscape.
- **Preparation:** Mark critical support/resistance, note decisive mitigation
  blocks, and layer seasonal tendencies plus macro drivers as context.
- **Focus areas:** Locate higher-time-frame order blocks or inefficiencies
  likely to be revisited and keep them visible for lower-tier planning.

### H4 timeframe

- **Objective:** Convert the daily roadmap into actionable scenarios.
- **Preparation:** Scan for major support/resistance zones, liquidity pools, and
  active order or mitigation blocks that align with D1.
- **Focus areas:** Track monthly and quarterly reference points, pivot ranges,
  and structural patterns that could shift bias ahead of sessions.

### H1 timeframe

- **Objective:** Build the execution plan that respects higher context.
- **Preparation:** Keep the H1 analysis front and centre while confirming
  alignment with D1/H4.
- **Focus areas:** Prioritise optimal swing highs/lows, session opens/closes,
  the previous three days' extremes, and refresh the weekly roadmap each Monday.

### M15 timeframe

- **Objective:** Time entries with precision without abandoning the higher
  narrative.
- **Preparation:** Maintain sight of the D1/H4/H1 story, use vertical separators
  to track sessions, and inherit key levels from the higher tiers.
- **Focus areas:** Plot daily pivots, Fibonacci refinement levels, prior-day
  short-term highs/lows, define the Asian range (00:00–05:00 GMT), and wait for
  validated patterns within 100–150 pip ranges.

## 8. Top-Down Analysis Workflow

| Stage             | Focus                                      | Key actions                                                                                                         | Output                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Market scan**   | Gauge risk appetite                        | Review equities, commodities, DXY, gold, and oil; note catalysts supporting or contradicting your idea.             | Bias note confirming or rejecting the trade thesis.                |
| **Anticipatory**  | Do the heavy lifting before the week opens | Study D1 + USD context, seasonal tendencies, key levels, liquidity pools, and order blocks likely to be retested.   | Complete scenarios with preferred entries and invalidation points. |
| **Execution**     | Apply plans session by session             | Decide buy/sell focus, sync with M15 for BOS/CHoCH/S+D/OTE/SMT confirmation, and map the Asian range before acting. | Orders or alerts aligned with timing and structure.                |
| **Management**    | Steward open risk                          | Reassess partials, stops, hedges, and scaling using a documented checklist.                                         | Updated log of real-time adjustments.                              |
| **Reactionary**   | Extract lessons post-trade                 | Review completed trades for repeatability and criteria to pause or re-engage.                                       | Structured notes highlighting what to repeat, refine, or skip.     |
| **Documentation** | Archive evidence                           | Journal thesis, execution, R:R, adherence, and attach charts/screenshots.                                           | Traceable record for retrospectives and drawdown reviews.          |

## 9. Textbook Structure Example

- Higher-time-frame levels define key zones (supply/demand, order blocks,
  mitigation areas).
- A Change of Character occurs when price breaks the most recent swing against
  the prevailing trend.
- A Break of Structure confirms continuation with fresh highs/lows aligned to
  the active trend.
- Short-term highs/lows and intermediate levels provide entry and management
  cues around those zones.

## 10. Applying These Concepts in Projects

- **Codify the hierarchy:** Translate the primary → tertiary framework into
  utilities that classify swings per timeframe. Use it to surface bias in
  dashboards, backtests, or alerts.
- **Automate structural alerts:** Map BOS/CHoCH detection to notifications and
  pair them with the execution discipline checklist for confirmation prompts.
- **Enrich strategy reviews:** Track how trades respected equilibrium zones,
  reacted to liquidity grabs, and followed the management guidance.
- **Standardise terminology:** Reuse the cheat sheet across documentation,
  journals, and training materials to keep collaboration precise.
- **Build scenario playbooks:** Combine the textbook example with project charts
  to show how structure evolved, why trades succeeded or failed, and how the
  guidelines would adjust the plan.

## 11. Dynamic Trading Algo (DTA) Improvement Checklist

- [x] **Root Task: Data & Structure Integrity**
  - [ ] Validate market-structure inputs by comparing automated swing,
        liquidity, and BOS/CHoCH tags with manual annotations on representative
        symbols and timeframes.
  - [ ] Audit data freshness so the algo never acts on stale structure signals
        across charting, backtests, and live feeds.
- [x] **Root Task: Bias & Signal Engine**
  - [ ] Stress-test bias calculations with conflicting primary, intermediate,
        and short-term structures to confirm the hierarchy drives direction.
  - [ ] Codify entry prerequisites from the execution discipline list and
        surface violations in logs or dashboards.
  - [ ] Integrate liquidity-based alerts with metadata showing confirmation
        status and historical hit rate.
- [x] **Root Task: Execution & Risk Controls**
  - [ ] Instrument execution quality—slippage, fill speed, and order
        rejections—around structural pivot trades.
  - [ ] Tighten risk parameters (stops, scaling, exposure caps) and enforce them
        through configuration or parameter stores that respect the hierarchy.
- [x] **Root Task: Monitoring & Continuous Learning**
  - [ ] Schedule retros where traders replay tagged scenarios, comparing algo
        actions with documented playbooks to refine logic.
  - [ ] Automate weekly scorecards covering win rate, expectancy, and drawdown
        segmented by structure regime (trending, ranging, transition).
- [x] **Root Task: Change & Deployment Management**
  - [ ] Optimise build and deployment pipelines by profiling CI/CD caching,
        dependency pruning, or container layering to reduce image build time and
        drift.
  - [ ] Document every structural rule update with before/after examples, test
        evidence, and deployment dates for faster debugging and compliance
        reviews.
