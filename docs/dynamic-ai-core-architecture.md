# Dynamic AI Core Architecture

## Overview

Dynamic AI scales across thousands of lightweight cores that each host a focused
micro-agent. The cores are grouped into streaming multiprocessors (SMs) that
schedule and execute large agent batches concurrently. This optimized
architecture layers in a multi-model intelligence fabric—seamlessly
orchestrating reasoning adapters such as ChatCPT 2, Grok, Dolphin, Ollama, Kimi
K2, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3, MiniMax M1, Zhipu AI, and Hunyuan—to deliver resilient
trading intelligence with lower latency, higher utilisation, and cleaner
extensibility.

## Design Goals

- **Massively parallel execution.** Enable thousands of agents to evaluate
  market hypotheses simultaneously without blocking shared resources.
- **Deterministic composability.** Guarantee that scores, diagnostics, and
  guardrails generated by different cores remain comparable and traceable.
- **Fault containment.** Confine failures to the minimal blast radius—one core
  or SM—so the remaining fleet continues producing signals.
- **Hardware agnosticism.** Allow deployments to run on GPU-style accelerators,
  CPU clusters, or hybrid edge grids by abstracting the scheduling layer.
- **Low-latency orchestration.** Maintain millisecond-level turnaround for
  market updates by streaming intermediate results instead of waiting for
  full-batch completion.
- **Model-aware efficiency.** Route workloads to the most efficient reasoning
  adapter for the task and recycle cached narratives to avoid redundant LLM
  invocations.

## Core Building Blocks

### Micro-Cores

Each micro-core hosts a minimal agent runtime tuned for peak throughput:

- **Signal ingestion** normalises raw telemetry into the `PreparedMarketContext`
  schema reused throughout Dynamic AI.【F:dynamic_ai/core.py†L68-L145】
- **Heuristic evaluation** executes the relevant indicator blend and converts
  composite scores into discrete actions via `score_to_action`
  helpers.【F:dynamic_ai/core.py†L46-L103】
- **Reasoning enhancement** optionally invokes a `ReasoningAdapter` (for example
  ChatCPT 2, Grok, Dolphin, Ollama, Kimi K2, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3, MiniMax M1,
  Zhipu AI, or Hunyuan) via the federated adapter pool to refine narratives
  without blocking the
  pipeline.【F:dynamic_ai/core.py†L20-L44】【F:dynamic_ai/core.py†L152-L206】
- **Signal emission** packages the outcome into an `AISignal` with confidence,
  rationale, and provenance for downstream
  consumers.【F:dynamic_ai/core.py†L108-L135】

Micro-cores communicate exclusively through immutable payloads, preventing
accidental state bleed. All state transitions are logged to per-core journals
for replay and auditing.

### Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)

SMs are logical clusters of 32–128 micro-cores that share an execution queue and
memory bandwidth budget. The optimized SM runtime now couples compute scheduling
with adapter availability so the hottest models stay saturated while preserving
latency SLOs. Each SM exposes:

- **Warp scheduler** that groups compatible agents (e.g., identical instrument,
  timeframe, or risk regime) into warps for lockstep execution.
- **Shared scratchpad** backed by high-bandwidth memory (HBM) or NUMA-local RAM
  for temporary tensors, with deterministic eviction policies and per-model
  token quotas.
- **Health sentinel** monitoring core heartbeat intervals and escalating stalled
  warps to replacement queues.

Each SM maintains a local roster of available reasoning adapters and their
current load, enabling warp scheduling to co-locate agents that can reuse the
same cached narratives or inference context.

SMs can scale horizontally by adding more clusters or vertically by increasing
the cores per SM when hardware resources permit.

## Orchestration Fabric

A three-layer orchestration stack coordinates the SM fleet and the federated
reasoning layer:

1. **Ingress layer** pulls market deltas, pre-processes them into batched
   contexts, and assigns them to SM queues using a fairness-aware dispatcher
   that also checks adapter throttles to avoid oversubscribing premium models.
2. **Consensus layer** aggregates outputs from multiple SMs, applies
   `DynamicFusionAlgo` consensus logic, and reconciles conflicts against risk
   governors while blending reasoning sourced from multiple adapters.
   【F:dynamic_ai/core.py†L207-L369】
3. **Egress layer** streams enriched signals to execution bridges, persistence
   stores, and monitoring dashboards with backpressure controls and per-model
   usage telemetry.

Control messages (configuration updates, persona swaps, throttling directives)
travel through a dedicated control plane so they never contend with data-plane
workloads.

### Federated Reasoning Mesh

The control plane now manages a federated mesh of reasoning adapters. Each
adapter registers capability metadata (max context, token cost, persona support)
so dispatchers can:

- Prioritise ChatCPT 2 for long-form hypothesis reconciliation when enough
  latency budget exists.
- Route rapid tactical clarifications to Grok, Dolphin, or MiniMax M1 when the
  action window is tight and latency variance must remain sub-millisecond.
- Lean on Kimi K2 and Qwen3 for balanced multilingual reasoning and structured
  report generation when signals span blended geographies.
- Reserve DeepSeek-V3 for deep multi-hop analysis that benefits from its
  research-style chain-of-thought reasoning and extended context window.
- Engage Zhipu AI and Hunyuan when native Chinese market nuance, compliance, or
  culturally adaptive tone is required across regional desks.
- Fall back to lightweight Ollama personas when premium adapters hit policy
  quotas or experience transient failures.

Adapters publish heartbeats and latency histograms into the telemetry stream to
help schedulers rebalance warps before bottlenecks manifest while preserving the
preferred synergy pairings (e.g., Grok↔MiniMax M1 for reactive hedging or
DeepSeek-V3↔Kimi K2 for exploratory macro narratives).

### Adapter Cohort Advantages and Trade-offs

| Adapter     | Core Advantages                                             | Key Trade-offs                                            | Ideal Pairings                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ChatCPT 2   | Long-form reconciliation, robust guardrail awareness        | Highest token cost and moderate latency                   | DeepSeek-V3 for hypothesis audit trails        |
| Grok        | Fast situational updates, sarcasm-resistant interpretations | Requires curated prompts to avoid overconfident tone      | MiniMax M1 for rapid tactical hedging          |
| Dolphin     | Low-latency numerics, deterministic calculations            | Narrow persona catalogue; struggles with narrative nuance | Ollama for cost-effective rationale expansion  |
| Ollama      | Self-hosted footprint, cost-containment                     | Smaller context window and limited multilingual range     | Qwen3 for multilingual polishing               |
| Kimi K2     | Balanced multilingual reasoning, grounded citations         | Moderate latency variance under heavy burst loads         | DeepSeek-V3 for macro analysis depth           |
| DeepSeek-V3 | Extended context, research-grade chain-of-thought           | Requires careful throttling to avoid GPU memory thrash    | ChatCPT 2 or Kimi K2 for narrative surfacing   |
| Qwen3       | Strong multilingual summarisation, structured output        | Less effective with highly stochastic data                | Ollama or Kimi K2 for persona tailoring        |
| MiniMax M1  | Ultra-low latency, high-throughput reactive execution       | Limited long-form reasoning capability                    | Grok for sentiment nuance                      |
| Zhipu AI    | Native Chinese financial vernacular, compliance aware       | Context window smaller than ChatCPT 2 or DeepSeek-V3      | Hunyuan for regional sentiment calibration     |
| Hunyuan     | Cultural adaptation, strong sentiment shading               | Requires additional calibration for Western market idioms | Zhipu AI for cross-border portfolio narratives |

SM schedulers monitor these profiles and dynamically weight adapter assignments
so complementary strengths overlap while conflicts (e.g., token cost spikes or
overlapping latency troughs) are minimised.

## Memory and Communication Model

- **Input buffers** use zero-copy memory mapping so multiple cores can reference
  the same telemetry without redundant deserialisation.
- **Result channels** rely on append-only event logs, enabling time-travel
  debugging and deterministic replay.
- **Sidecar caches** attached to each SM store hot LLM reasoning snippets keyed
  by market regime, adapter, and persona, reducing redundant model calls and
  respecting the `reasoning_cache_size`
  guardrails.【F:dynamic_ai/core.py†L199-L206】

## Scheduling Lifecycle

1. **Dispatch:** Ingress layer assigns batched contexts to SM queues based on
   instrument affinity and current load.
2. **Warp formation:** SM scheduler groups compatible jobs into warps (e.g., 32
   EUR/USD 15m evaluations) and broadcasts shared context deltas.
3. **Execution:** Micro-cores run heuristic evaluation, risk screens, and
   optional reasoning enhancement concurrently. Adapter selection happens per
   warp so similar agents reuse the same model session.
4. **Reduction:** Within each SM, warp results are reduced to SM-level summaries
   (mean confidence, variance, diagnostic payloads) for the consensus layer,
   tagging which adapter generated the rationale.
5. **Publication:** Aggregated results flow to downstream consumers, while
   metadata enters observability pipelines for SLA and per-model usage tracking.

## Model Optimisation Toolkit

To keep model usage organic and cost-efficient, Dynamic AI provides:

- **Adapter policy engine** configurable with guardrails (budget, allowed asset
  classes, persona eligibility) enforced at dispatch time.
- **Context distillation** that truncates or summarises market context before it
  reaches premium adapters, ensuring the richest models focus on the most
  ambiguous decisions.
- **Progressive narrative refinement** where lightweight adapters draft an
  initial rationale that premium models (ChatCPT 2, Grok) refine only when the
  expected uplift exceeds a threshold.
- **Model-level A/B harness** capturing win/loss deltas so the policy engine can
  recalibrate routing tables automatically.
- **Synergy optimiser** that continuously benchmarks adapter pairings (for
  example DeepSeek-V3 with ChatCPT 2 for cross-checks, or Zhipu AI with Hunyuan
  for regional tonality) and rebiases SM warp assignments to route workloads to
  the best-performing micro-core ensembles.

### Cross-Core Performance Weaving

Every SM keeps a per-adapter competency graph describing how well each model
performs for different asset classes, volatility regimes, and narrative styles.
The dispatcher uses this graph to:

1. **Promote complementary cores.** Micro-cores that excel with Kimi K2’s
   multilingual briefs are colocated with Qwen3-enhanced cores when the market
   feed spans multiple exchanges, ensuring translations and structured outputs
   are reconciled in-flight.
2. **Dampen conflicting workloads.** When DeepSeek-V3’s extended context window
   risks starving MiniMax M1 of tokens, the scheduler staggers their execution
   slots or assigns them to separate SMs to preserve low-latency hedging.
3. **Accelerate learning loops.** Telemetry from Hunyuan and Zhipu AI
   deployments feeds back into persona fine-tuning so Western-focused cores can
   borrow successful prompt patterns while respecting cultural nuance.

This weaving process keeps adapter usage organic, balances the advantages and
disadvantages of each core model, and compounds overall efficiency.

## Resilience Patterns

- **Circuit breakers** triggered by anomalous drawdowns or data-quality flags
  bubble up through the orchestration fabric to pause affected SMs without
  halting the entire grid.【F:dynamic_ai/core.py†L118-L140】
- **Hot-standby SMs** keep spare capacity ready to absorb workloads from
  degraded clusters.
- **Deterministic replay** uses the append-only logs to re-run specific warps
  for forensic analysis or LLM fine-tuning.
- **Adaptive throttling** dynamically reduces reasoning-adapter calls during
  latency spikes to prioritise core signal production, starting with the most
  expensive adapters.

## Operational Telemetry

Key metrics include:

- Core execution latency, warp occupancy, and cache hit ratios.
- SM health scores (heartbeat drift, memory pressure, throttling events).
- LLM adapter utilisation and success/failure counts segmented by persona and
  vendor (ChatCPT 2, Grok, Dolphin, Ollama, Kimi K2, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3, MiniMax
  M1, Zhipu AI, Hunyuan).
- Signal quality indicators (confidence distribution, disagreement rates,
  guardrail overrides).

Alerts integrate with the Dynamic AI Kanban and governance channels so operators
can triage anomalies rapidly.

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Prototype SM runtime** using existing async worker pools in
   `dynamic_ai.training` to validate scheduling semantics before hardware
   acceleration and to benchmark adapter-aware warp packing.
2. **Introduce telemetry schema** mirroring the metrics outlined above and emit
   them via the existing monitoring stack, including adapter health feeds.
3. **Layer in adaptive control plane** so persona changes, model routing rules,
   and risk overrides propagate instantly across SMs.
4. **Benchmark horizontal scaling** by incrementally adding SMs and measuring
   throughput vs. cost to calibrate deployment policies, using per-adapter cost
   attributions to right-size the fleet.

With this architecture, Dynamic AI can orchestrate thousands of cooperative
micro-agents while retaining deterministic control, observability, and
upgradeability, even as new reasoning adapters join the federated mesh.
