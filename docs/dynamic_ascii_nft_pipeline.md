# Dynamic ASCII NFT Pipeline

## Purpose
This document outlines how to transform user images into ASCII-rendered artwork, mint dynamic NFTs around the outputs, and deliver interactive experiences through Telegram bots and mini apps. It supports the broader Dynamic Capital AGI ecosystem by detailing automation hooks, smart-contract considerations, and user touchpoints.

## Workflow Overview
1. **Image Intake**
   - Accept media from Telegram bots, web uploads, or AGI-sourced inputs.
   - Normalize formats (PNG/JPEG/WebP) and enforce size and aspect constraints for ASCII rendering.
2. **Pre-Processing**
   - Resize for target character grid while preserving visual balance.
   - Convert to grayscale and optionally enhance contrast or sharpen edges.
   - Apply edge detection or dithering if higher contour emphasis is desired.
3. **ASCII Rendering**
   - Map brightness values to ordered character sets; reserve support for Unicode gradients when higher fidelity is needed.
   - Offer colorization layers through ANSI escape codes or HTML span wrappers for rich previews.
   - Embed optional signatures, Dhivehi glyphs, or AGI state markers to reinforce provenance.
4. **Compression & Packaging**
   - Run-length encoding for repetitive spans, with optional Huffman dictionaries for high-volume drops.
   - Provide both compact preview blocks and high-resolution variants, stored as plain text, SVG, or PNG renderings.
5. **Metadata Assembly**
   - Generate ERC-721 or compatible JSON metadata with fields for character set, AGI intelligence score, module lineage, and oracle trigger definitions.
   - Store ASCII payloads on-chain when byte-size permits; otherwise upload to IPFS/Arweave and reference via content hashes.
6. **Minting & Updates**
   - Deploy or reuse contracts supporting ERC-4906 (metadata refresh) to broadcast state changes.
   - Wire Chainlink or equivalent oracles to ingest AGI intelligence outputs, market feeds, or mentorship milestones that trigger artwork regeneration.
7. **Distribution & Engagement**
   - Return minted asset links and inline ASCII previews through Telegram bots.
   - Surface dynamic galleries inside Telegram mini apps, allowing holders to trigger refreshes, share collectibles, or review provenance history.

## Telegram Bot & Mini App Integration
- **Bot Flow**: users submit an image → receive ASCII preview variations → confirm mint → bot handles wallet auth (TON or EVM) and returns NFT details.
- **Mini App Features**: curated galleries, intelligence-driven rarity displays, and mentorship dashboards that highlight earned ASCII artifacts.
- **Notification Hooks**: bots announce AGI-driven updates, state changes, or marketplace sales to keep collectors engaged.

## AGI & Data Inputs
- Feed model outputs, oracle data, or mentorship achievements into the rendering pipeline to drive character selection, palette rotation, and storyline overlays.
- Log seeds, prompts, and transformation parameters for verifiable provenance and reproducibility.

## Operational Considerations
- Bundle formatting scripts into CI to validate ASCII payload size, compression ratios, and metadata schema before minting.
- Cache intermediate renders for quick replays in Telegram and marketplaces.
- Monitor gas/storage costs; prefer batched minting and metadata updates where possible.

## Implementation Checklist
### Pipeline Foundations
- [ ] Build an ingestion service that accepts Telegram uploads, REST payloads, and AGI-sourced images with validation on size and aspect ratio.
- [ ] Implement the pre-processing module (resize, grayscale, edge enhancement) with configurable presets for different ASCII output tiers.
- [ ] Develop the ASCII renderer supporting multiple charsets, optional ANSI color, and templated overlays for signatures or glyphs.
- [ ] Package compression routines (RLE, Huffman) and benchmark storage savings for preview versus archival variants.

### Smart Contracts & Data Plumbing
- [ ] Author the NFT contract set with ERC-4906 metadata update events and role-gated oracle updaters for dynamic refreshes.
- [ ] Wire Chainlink (or equivalent) jobs that translate AGI intelligence scores or market data into contract calls, including failover rules.
- [ ] Define metadata schemas and storage policies (on-chain vs. IPFS/Arweave) with automated hash verification scripts.

### Telegram & Mini App Experience
- [ ] Extend the Telegram bot to deliver multi-style ASCII previews, capture mint confirmations, and hand off to TON/EVM wallet auth flows.
- [ ] Ship a mini app gallery that surfaces ownership state, refresh history, and buttons to trigger allowable dynamic updates.
- [ ] Instrument bot and mini app telemetry (conversion latency, mint success, user drop-off) for feedback into AGI tuning loops.

### Quality Gates & Operations
- [ ] Add CI checks that lint metadata JSON, enforce compression thresholds, and render smoke-test ASCII snapshots on pull requests.
- [ ] Publish runbooks covering cache warm-up, oracle credential rotation, contract pause procedures, and marketplace notification handling.
- [ ] Establish on-call alerts for conversion errors, oracle lag, and failed metadata refresh transactions.
