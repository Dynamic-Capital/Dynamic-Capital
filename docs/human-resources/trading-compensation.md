### Administration Checklist

- [ ] Cap payouts so combined employee distributions do not exceed the
      investor-aligned performance fee allocation (see below).
- [ ] Log trader acknowledgements of risk policy compliance before releasing
      payments.

## Introducing Broker (IB) Commissions

### Structure

- 5%–10% of deposits generated by referred clients.
- USD $5–$10 per standard lot traded by the IB's referrals.

### Eligibility & Controls

- [ ] Ensure IB status is documented with signed agreements and compliance
      approvals.
- [ ] Validate referral attribution via CRM or Supabase event logs before paying
      commissions.
- [ ] Apply clawbacks for churned accounts as stipulated in referral contracts.

## Performance Bonuses

### Pool Funding

- Allocate 5%–10% of annual profits to the bonus pool after investor and
  reinvestment commitments are fulfilled.
- Limit pool drawdowns if trading performance falls below the minimum investor
  hurdle rate.

### Distribution Cadence

- Quarterly for high-velocity teams needing continuous incentives.
- Annually for strategic retention bonuses tied to company-wide KPIs.

### Bonus Checklist

- [ ] Publish KPI scorecards ahead of each bonus cycle.
- [ ] Obtain executive approval for pool size and distribution formula.
- [ ] Communicate bonus letters alongside updated salary or profit-sharing
      adjustments.

## Alignment with Investor Profit Split

Per `docs/private-fund-pool.md`, net profits flow as:

1. **64% Investor Payouts:** Primary obligation to limited partners. Must be
   completed before employee variable compensation is executed.
2. **16% Reinvestment:** Allocate to growth reserves and platform enhancements.
   Profit-sharing draws cannot reduce this reserve below the mandated threshold.
3. **20% Performance Fee:** Serves as the ceiling for trader profit-sharing,
   analyst overrides, and bonus pool allocations.

**Sequencing Requirements**

- [ ] Complete investor payouts and reinvestment transfers before scheduling
      employee distributions.
- [ ] If cumulative employee variable compensation would exceed the 20%
      performance fee, convene governance to approve deferrals or rebalancing.
- [ ] Maintain a ledger mapping each payout to the associated performance fee
      tranche for audit readiness.

## Governance & Review

- Refresh this policy annually or when material changes to investor agreements
  occur.
- Store compensation approvals and payout reports in the HR compliance vault
  with restricted access.
- Provide summary metrics to leadership (total salary spend, profit share
  percentages, commission tallies) each quarter.

## Compensation Run Algorithm

### Inputs

- Verified monthly trading P&L export (desk-level and trader-level breakdowns).
- Investor distribution ledger showing completion of the 64/16/20 split
  sequencing.
- HRIS roster with salary bands, role levels, and eligibility flags (profit
  share, IB, bonus).
- Referral CRM report for IB activity and clawback status.
- Compliance attestations confirming risk policy adherence for all variable-comp
  recipients.

### Outputs

- Signed compensation packet summarizing fixed salaries, variable payouts, and
  investor-aligned reserves.
- Payment file or batch instructions for payroll, profit-sharing transfers, and
  IB commissions.
- Governance log noting approvals, exceptions, and performance fee utilization.
- Updated performance fee tracker reflecting remaining headroom after payouts.

### Monthly Run Workflow

1. **Pre-Run Validation**
   1. Lock the accounting period and reconcile trading P&L with finance.
      - If reconciliation variance exceeds 1% of monthly desk P&L, halt the run
        and escalate to the CFO.
   2. Confirm investor payouts (64%) and reinvestment transfers (16%) have
      settled; document transaction IDs in the ledger.
      - If either bucket is outstanding, reschedule the compensation run and
        notify HR leadership.
   3. Refresh the performance fee pool balance (20%) and subtract any
      prior-period carryovers or clawbacks.
2. **Fixed Salary Processing**
   1. Generate the payroll batch using HRIS salary bands.
   2. Spot-check variance against prior month for ±5% swings; if exceeded,
      require HRBP approval with justification (promotion, COLA, etc.).
   3. Queue disbursement and update the governance log with total fixed salary
      spend.
3. **Profit Sharing Allocation**
   1. For each eligible trader or analyst, compute share = eligible P&L × tier
      percentage.
   2. Validate compliance attestations (risk logs, journal entries). If missing,
      hold payout and trigger remediation workflow.
   3. Sum all calculated profit shares; if the amount exceeds remaining
      performance fee headroom, pro-rate payouts or defer per governance policy
      and capture decision in the log.
4. **IB Commission Calculation**
   1. Import referral CRM report and filter for eligible deposits/lots with
      cleared clawback windows.
   2. Compute commission using the configured percentage and per-lot schedule.
   3. Cross-check totals against Supabase referral events; discrepancies >2%
      require re-audit before release.
5. **Bonus Pool Consideration (Quarterly/Annual)**
   1. Determine whether the cycle triggers a bonus event; if not, skip to
      step 6.
   2. Confirm bonus pool funding (5%–10% of annual profits) is within the
      remaining performance fee allocation.
   3. Allocate bonuses based on KPI scoring matrix, documenting weights and
      approvals.
6. **Approval & Release**
   1. Compile the compensation packet with salary, profit share, commission, and
      bonus summaries plus remaining performance fee balance.
   2. Route packet for COO, CFO, and compliance signatures; capture timestamps
      in governance log.
   3. After approvals, transmit payment batches to payroll/treasury systems and
      archive receipts in the HR compliance vault.
7. **Post-Run Audit**
   1. Update performance fee tracker with actual disbursed amounts and residual
      headroom.
   2. File exception reports (deferrals, clawbacks, compliance holds) and assign
      follow-up owners.
   3. Schedule a retro review; incorporate lessons into the next policy refresh
      if systemic issues arise.
