# Desk Hub Mini App â€“ Token Hub Development Checklist

This checklist translates the Dynamic Capital Token (DCT) whitepaper into actionable tasks for the Desk Hub mini app token hub.
Use it to coordinate product, engineering, governance, and compliance workstreams.

## Foundation & Architecture

- [ ] Confirm user journeys for accessing Intelligence, Execution, and Liquidity layers within the mini app.
- [ ] Map DCT staking flows that gate access to tiered tooling and AI copilots.
- [ ] Integrate TON wallet authentication and transaction signing for all on-chain actions.
- [ ] Implement modular smart contract interactions to support future cross-chain extensions.

## Token Supply & Emissions

- [ ] Mirror genesis supply and allocation tables in on-chain and off-chain documentation.
- [ ] Codify emission halving logic (12-month cadence) inside the emissions scheduler.
- [ ] Enforce multi-signature and timelock controls on treasury mint functions.
- [ ] Surface vesting status for contributors, partners, grants, and public sale tranches.

## Utility & Incentive Mechanisms

- [ ] Build staking tier management with dynamic parameter configuration via governance.
- [ ] Implement fee rebate calculations for execution, vault, and data subscriptions.
- [ ] Enable liquidity mining dashboards tracking depth, uptime, and risk-adjusted returns.
- [ ] Meter protocol services (backtesting, APIs, bots) as DCT credit consumption.

## Governance Experience

- [ ] Ship proposal lifecycle UI covering ideation, temperature check, and on-chain voting.
- [ ] Support delegation workflows for Token Assembly representatives.
- [ ] Integrate Contributor Council review checkpoints before escalation to token votes.
- [ ] Visualize quorum thresholds relative to total DCT staked.

## Treasury Management

- [ ] Display treasury asset allocation across stable assets, yield vaults, and liquidity positions.
- [ ] Add approval workflows requiring dual sign-off from Contributor Council and Token Assembly.
- [ ] Generate monthly transparency reports detailing inflows, outflows, and performance.
- [ ] Monitor treasury risk limits and alert operators when thresholds are breached.

## Compliance & Risk Controls

- [ ] Embed programmatic KYC/KYB checks for institutional participants.
- [ ] Integrate audit reports and continuous monitoring feeds for smart contracts.
- [ ] Enforce leverage caps, vault concentration limits, and circuit breaker toggles via UI controls.
- [ ] Log compliance decisions and provide exportable reports for regulators.

## Roadmap Alignment

- [ ] Track Phase 1 deliverables (staking tiers, governance portal, market-making incentives).
- [ ] Track Phase 2 deliverables (AI copilots, cross-venue routing, risk dashboards).
- [ ] Track Phase 3 deliverables (custodial integrations, structured products, compliance tooling).
- [ ] Track Phase 4 deliverables (cross-chain staking, fee credits, bridge integrations).

## Adoption & Analytics

- [ ] Instrument activation metrics for traders across the Intelligence, Execution, and Liquidity layers.
- [ ] Capture staking retention, delegation participation, and proposal completion rates.
- [ ] Monitor liquidity depth, vault performance, and emissions distribution effectiveness.
- [ ] Provide exportable analytics snapshots for strategy contributors and treasury stewards.

## Operational Readiness

- [ ] Define incident response playbooks for on-chain anomalies and compliance breaches.
- [ ] Establish monitoring alerts for governance inactivity or quorum risk.
- [ ] Train support teams on user journeys, staking requirements, and compliance workflows.
- [ ] Document rollout plan for phased roadmap delivery within Desk Hub.
