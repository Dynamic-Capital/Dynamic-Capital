# Variables and Links Checklist

Use this checklist to verify the project is configured for production rather
than a test environment.

## Environment variables and handles

- [ ] Confirm all required secrets are set in Supabase Edge functions (e.g.,
      `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_URL`,
      `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`).
- [ ] Ensure each secret corresponds to the live project, not staging values.
- [ ] Verify any bot handles or usernames referenced in code match the
      production bot.
- [ ] Remove or replace any placeholder tokens or test identifiers in `.env`
      files and scripts.

## Links and endpoints

- [ ] Check that `MINI_APP_URL` points to the production domain.
- [ ] Search the codebase for `localhost`, `test`, or staging URLs and replace
      them with production hosts.
- [ ] Run `deno run -A scripts/audit-edge-hosts.ts` and
      `deno run -A scripts/check-linkage.ts` to confirm all function calls use
      the expected Supabase host.
- [ ] Verify any external links in the Mini App UI lead to live services.

Run through this list before deploying to ensure the bot and Mini App reference
only production resources.
