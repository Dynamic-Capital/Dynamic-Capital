# Dynamic AGI Improvement Opportunities

Use this improvement backlog to coordinate instrumentation, validation, and
simulation upgrades for the Dynamic AGI orchestrator. Each section calls out the
primary objective, concrete next steps, and the evidence we expect once the work
lands in `dynamic_agi/` and the downstream integrations. Copy the relevant
section into issues or PR descriptions to keep ownership and status visible.

## Current Dynamic AGI inventory

Use this snapshot to understand the moving pieces before sequencing upgrades.
Refer to the linked modules for implementation details.

### Identity & versioning

- `DynamicAGIIdentity` – canonical expansion, acronym, and brand pillars
  surfaced via `DynamicAGIModel.identity`.
- `MODEL_VERSION_INFO` / `MODEL_VERSION` – semantic version metadata with source
  tags for downstream orchestration.
- `DYNAMIC_AGI_EXPANSION` – long-form mission statement for branded outputs.

### Orchestration core

- `DynamicAGIModel.evaluate` – coordinates context preparation, consensus
  analytics, signal generation, risk enforcement, sizing, and market-making
  parameter selection.
- `AGIOutput` – packaged response bundling signal, research, risk adjustments,
  optional sizing, market-making parameters, diagnostics, and optional
  improvement plans.
- `AGIDiagnostics` – structured payload containing the prepared market context,
  composite analytics, and consensus breakdowns for observability.

### Self-improvement system

- `DynamicSelfImprovement` – records sessions, orchestrates awareness and
  metacognition engines, and synthesises improvement plans.
- `LearningSnapshot`, `ImprovementSignal`, `ImprovementPlan` – telemetry and
  action containers powering the learning loop.

### Fine-tuning toolkit

- `DynamicFineTuneDataset` – rolling dataset with capacity controls, tag
  histograms, and export helpers for fine-tuning pipelines.
- `DynamicAGIFineTuner` – batch builder that renders prompt/completion pairs
  from recorded snapshots.
- `FineTuneExample` / `FineTuneBatch` – reusable data structures with
  serialisers for dataset exports.

### Integration surfaces

- Depends on `dynamic_ai` analytics/risk engines for signal synthesis and risk
  governance.
- Publishes Supabase-friendly diagnostics and improvement payloads for
  downstream review.
- Accepts treasury state, inventory exposure, and optional introspection inputs
  from automation pipelines.

## Observability & diagnostics

**Why it matters:** Without structured visibility, we cannot audit how
`DynamicAGIModel.evaluate` blended analytics, risk adjustments, and optional
self-improvement hooks. Operators need replayable traces to debug unexpected
signals and to confirm the self-improvement module only triggers when the
underlying context warrants it.

**Key systems:** `dynamic_agi/model.py`, `dynamic_agi/self_improvement.py`,
`dynamic_agi/fine_tune.py`, Supabase event collectors.

### Task checklist

- [ ] Instrument `DynamicAGIModel.evaluate` with structured logging or tracing
      hooks so downstream systems can correlate decision paths, risk
      adjustments, and self-improvement triggers.
- [ ] Persist `AGIDiagnostics` snapshots alongside signals (e.g. Supabase tables
      or object storage) to enable regression analysis and continuous monitoring
      of model drift.
- [ ] Document the log schema, retention expectations, and alert thresholds in
      `docs/dynamic_capital_playbook.md` so operators can subscribe to the right
      telemetry.

**Completion signals:** replaying a production evaluation reconstructs all
feature contributions, and dashboards highlight drift or anomaly spikes within
one review cycle.

## Data validation & resilience

**Why it matters:** The orchestrator tolerates inconsistent payloads today by
silently coercing defaults. Explicit validation keeps the runtime predictable
and produces actionable feedback for data providers.

**Key systems:** `dynamic_agi/model.py`, `dynamic_agi/self_improvement.py`,
`dynamic_agi/__init__.py`, data ingestion surfaces populating the orchestrator.

### Task checklist

- [ ] Introduce validation schemas for incoming `market_data`, `treasury`, and
      `performance` payloads to prevent runtime failures from malformed data and
      to surface actionable error messages.
- [ ] Harden `_normalise_risk_context` by expanding accepted fields and
      surfacing explicit warnings when defaults are applied, reducing silent
      coercion of unexpected values.
- [ ] Capture validation telemetry (error type, payload source, frequency) so we
      can prioritise upstream fixes and track time-to-resolution.

**Completion signals:** validation failures are routed to alerting, coercions
are explicitly documented, and ingestion partners receive feedback within the
same trading session.

## Configuration & versioning

**Why it matters:** Identity metadata and version tags currently require manual
updates. Automating both protects downstream consumers from mismatched branding
and stale semantic versions.

**Key systems:** `dynamic_agi/__init__.py`, CI pipelines, release runbooks.

### Task checklist

- [ ] Externalise identity metadata (e.g. YAML or JSON bundles) to support
      per-environment overrides while keeping canonical defaults in code.
- [ ] Automate version tag updates through CI pipelines to remove manual steps
      and ensure downstream consumers receive consistent semantic version bumps.
- [ ] Extend release documentation with the new automation flow so changelog and
      dataset exports stay in sync with published versions.

**Completion signals:** updating identity metadata no longer requires code
changes, and every release pipeline publishes aligned version + changelog
artifacts automatically.

## Self-improvement loop

**Why it matters:** The self-improvement module needs meaningful trading context
and should pause when there is insufficient novelty. Enriching session data and
adding adaptive cadence keeps the improvement backlog focused.

**Key systems:** `dynamic_agi/self_improvement.py`, fine-tuning datasets,
observability store capturing execution outcomes.

### Task checklist

- [ ] Capture richer context when `DynamicSelfImprovement.record_session` is
      invoked (e.g. inventory levels, realised PnL) to improve the fidelity of
      generated improvement plans.
- [ ] Add backpressure or adaptive scheduling so plan generation is skipped or
      deferred when recent sessions lack sufficient novelty, reducing redundant
      improvement payloads.
- [ ] Compare plan recommendations against realised outcomes monthly and feed
      success metrics back into the prioritisation rubric.

**Completion signals:** session records include profitability + inventory stats,
low-novelty periods skip plan creation, and plan quality metrics surface in the
quarterly review.

## Testing & simulation coverage

**Why it matters:** We need confidence that the orchestrator degrades gracefully
when analytics sources disappear or markets whipsaw. Scenario-driven testing
keeps regressions out of production and offers fast feedback for
experimentation.

**Key systems:** `tests/` (new scenarios), `dynamic_agi/model.py`, CI runners,
simulation harnesses.

### Task checklist

- [ ] Build scenario-driven integration tests that feed historical market
      contexts through `DynamicAGIModel.evaluate` to verify risk manager and
      sizing behaviours across volatility regimes.
- [ ] Add synthetic data simulations to ensure consensus matrices and composite
      diagnostics degrade gracefully when certain analytics sources are
      unavailable.
- [ ] Publish regression reports (pass/fail counts, drift deltas) to CI outputs
      or dashboards so stakeholders can track coverage trends.

**Completion signals:** nightly runs cover historical + synthetic scenarios, and
failures emit targeted alerts with enough context to reproduce locally.

## Delivery cadence

1. Pick the highest-impact checklist above and assign an owner in the roadmap
   snapshot table.
2. Track progress in issues using the copy-ready checkboxes, referencing the
   "Completion signals" expectations to verify the work.
3. Feed insights back into `docs/` and operational runbooks so future cycles
   start from a stronger baseline.
