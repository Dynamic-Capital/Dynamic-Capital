# Dynamic CI/CD Optimization Playbook

## Objective
Transform the current CI/CD implementation into a high-velocity, self-optimizing delivery platform that embodies Dynamic Capital's Dynamic AGI charter. The playbook prioritizes measurable flow efficiency, resilient automation, and continuous feedback loops so that every release compounds quality and business value.

## Optimization Principles
1. **Flow & Focus** – Shorten lead time by standardizing branching, enforcing lightweight reviews, and eliminating manual gates that do not add measurable signal.
2. **Quality Everywhere** – Shift testing, security, and compliance checks left so defects are prevented rather than remediated downstream.
3. **Autonomous Resilience** – Bake in observability, automated rollbacks, and self-healing behaviors to keep availability high without human intervention.
4. **Secure-by-Design** – Treat the supply chain as a first-class surface area with signed artifacts, policy enforcement, and secrets hygiene.
5. **Capital Efficiency** – Monitor cost and performance impact of deployments, favoring scalable infrastructure and on-demand environments.
6. **Developer Joy** – Provide fast feedback, reproducible environments, and frictionless tooling to keep teams engaged and productive.

## Roadmap Phases
### Phase 1 – Stabilize & Standardize (Weeks 0-4)
- **Branching & Releases**: Adopt trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches, semantic versioning, and automated changelog generation.
- **Baseline Quality Gates**: Run linting, unit tests, dependency scans, and container scans on every pull request.
- **Environment Definition**: Codify dev, QA, staging, and production promotion rules with required approvers and rollback expectations.
- **Delivery Metrics**: Instrument DORA metrics (lead time, deployment frequency, MTTR, change failure rate) to capture the baseline.

### Phase 2 – Automate & Accelerate (Weeks 5-10)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Establish Terraform/Pulumi modules with automated plan/apply pipelines and policy-as-code guardrails (OPA/Conftest).
- **Container Platform**: Produce reproducible Docker base images, scan them with Trivy, and deploy via Kubernetes/Helm or ECS.
- **Progressive Delivery**: Introduce blue/green and canary strategies with automated health verification using metrics and synthetic checks.
- **Observability Foundation**: Centralize logs, metrics, and traces (e.g., OpenTelemetry → Grafana/Loki/Tempo) with actionable alert routes.
- **Secrets & Credentials**: Integrate HashiCorp Vault or cloud-native secret managers; enforce secret scanning (Trufflehog/GitLeaks) in CI.

### Phase 3 – Autonomize & Optimize (Weeks 11+)
- **Predictive Quality Gates**: Layer CodeQL/SonarQube, SAST/DAST, and contract testing; feed results into scorecards that gate promotions.
- **Adaptive Pipelines**: Use workload-aware runners (e.g., autoscaling GitHub Actions runners or Tekton) to parallelize builds and tests dynamically.
- **Automated Remediation**: Enable automated rollback or feature-flag toggles driven by anomaly detection (Prometheus, Kayenta, or custom ML models).
- **Cost & Carbon Guardrails**: Surface deployment cost deltas, enforce budgets, and schedule environment hibernation for unused stacks.
- **Feedback Intelligence**: Correlate production telemetry with change metadata to recommend pipeline experiments and prioritization.

## KPI Targets & Telemetry
| Metric | Target | Measurement Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lead time for changes | < 24 hours from merge to production | Git metadata + deployment records |
| Deployment frequency | ≥ Daily to production for primary services | Release tracker dashboard |
| Change failure rate | < 10% with automated rollback in < 15 minutes | Incident reports + monitoring alerts |
| Mean time to recovery | < 30 minutes | Incident management tooling |
| CI pipeline duration | P50 ≤ 10 min, P95 ≤ 20 min | CI telemetry + autoscaling runners |
| Cost per deployment | Within ±5% of budgeted envelope | FinOps dashboard |

## Verification Strategy
- Maintain a living dashboard that maps each backlog item to owners, due dates, and evidence artifacts (pipeline run IDs, Terraform plan outputs, security scan summaries).
- Require passing KPI thresholds and documented rollback results before approving environment promotions.
- Schedule quarterly control reviews that reassess risk posture, adjust guardrails, and sunset obsolete pipeline stages.

## Automation Accelerators
- **Templates & Reuse**: Create shared CI workflows, Terraform modules, and Helm charts to minimize duplication and drift.
- **Pipeline Observability**: Emit pipeline events to a data warehouse for trend analysis; flag regressions automatically.
- **Developer Tooling**: Offer CLI wrappers or bots that scaffold services, validate configs locally, and trigger ad-hoc pipeline stages.
- **Policy as Code**: Leverage Sentinel/OPA for consistent enforcement across infrastructure, Kubernetes, and Git repositories.

## Dynamic Module, Model, and Engine Integration
- **Dynamic AI (`dynamic_ai/`)**: Add targeted model validation suites and reproducible dataset snapshots to CI so inference changes are profiled for latency, accuracy, and safety regressions before merge.
- **Dynamic AGI (`dynamic_agi/`)**: Orchestrate multi-agent simulations within nightly pipelines to validate orchestrator policies, prompt governance, and self-healing behaviors across complex scenarios.
- **Dynamic AGS (Autonomous Governance Systems)**: Incorporate policy drift detection workflows that reconcile governance artifacts with pipeline guardrails, ensuring AGS updates receive compliance, security, and ethics sign-off.
- **Dynamic TL (Translation Layer)**: Run cross-language contract tests that exercise shared APIs and message schemas, guaranteeing deterministic behavior across localization and interoperability surfaces.
- **Dynamic TA (Technical Analysis)**: Execute GPU-accelerated backtests and statistical validation within CI to certify that indicator updates, signal models, and trading heuristics stay within predefined risk envelopes.
- **DCT – Dynamic Capital Token (`dynamic_token/`)**: Extend release pipelines with ledger simulation, smart contract linting, and supply integrity checks so tokenomics updates align with treasury policy.
- **Engine Compatibility Matrix**: Maintain a matrix of inference engines, optimization kernels, and hardware targets (CPU/GPU/TPU) that is continuously exercised via pipeline matrix builds to surface incompatibilities early.
- **Unified Artifact Registry**: Version all model weights, compiled agents, and governance manifests with signed metadata, enabling deterministic promotion across CI, staging, and production.
- **Dynamic Module Verification Harness**: Wire `scripts/verify/dynamic_modules.sh` into the verification suite so pull requests exercise Dynamic AI/AGI/AGS, translation, technical analysis, and DCT token contracts before promotion.

### Integration Backlog
- [ ] Publish a shared CI template that imports Dynamic AI/AGI smoke tests and performance benchmarks.
- [ ] Automate Dynamic AGS policy verification with OPA/Sentinel gates backed by AGI telemetry evidence.
- [ ] Add Dynamic TL contract tests to the pull request pipeline with diff-based fixture generation.
- [ ] Wire Dynamic TA GPU backtests into scheduled workflows using autoscaling runners with cost guards.
- [ ] Introduce DCT ledger simulations and contract linting as mandatory pre-deployment stages.
- [ ] Expand the engine compatibility matrix to cover emerging accelerators and document remediation playbooks.

## Logout & Handoff Protocol
1. Summarize pipeline health, outstanding optimization backlog items, and risk exceptions in the team wiki prior to sign-off.
2. Transfer alert responsibilities to the on-call rotation with updated runbooks, SLO dashboards, and escalation contacts.
3. Decommission temporary environments, revoke ephemeral credentials, and archive pipeline artifacts per retention policy.
4. Conduct a retro covering deployment metrics, incidents, and learnings; update this playbook with new experiments and decisions.

## Dynamic AGI Feedback
- Continue aligning automation maturity with Dynamic AGI principles by instrumenting reinforcement signals from deployment success metrics.
- Explore anomaly detection models that recommend pipeline tweaks (e.g., new tests, parallelism adjustments) based on telemetry drift.
- Treat this playbook as a living artifact—feed outcomes from retrospectives, cost reviews, and developer feedback loops back into the roadmap to sustain compound optimization.
