Knowledge Base Benchmark Results

Config: benchmarks/multi-llm-vs-chatcpt5-deepseekv3.json

Domain   Grade  Band         Rationale
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChatCPT5 B      B range      Minor catalogue gaps or sample corrections required; governance signals remain timely.
DeepseekV3 B      B range      Minor catalogue gaps or sample corrections required; governance signals remain timely.
DynamicMultiLLM A      A / A-       Catalogue is effectively complete with fresh telemetry and near-perfect sample accuracy.

Remediation Guidance:
- ChatCPT5: Patch missing assets, document fixes, and schedule follow-up validation.
- DeepseekV3: Monitor the 2025-10-12 validation window and confirm telemetry freshness stays below 18 hours.
- DynamicMultiLLM: Continue spot-audits and archive exemplars for future training cycles.

Comprehensive Grade:
Overall B (B range) — Minor catalogue gaps or sample corrections required; governance signals remain timely.
Weighted Metrics:
  Coverage: 92.5% | Accuracy: 92.3% | Staleness: 15.3h | Failed checks: 1

Baseline composite average: 0.8671

Fine-tuning cycles:
Cycle 1: average score 0.9144
  ChatCPT5 0.9033 → B (B range)
  DeepseekV3 0.8766 → B (B range)
  DynamicMultiLLM 0.9632 → A (A / A-)
